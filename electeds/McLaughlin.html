    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=291.347s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=334.45s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=802.499s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I wanted to thank you and Mia for introducing me to the Food Security Task Force and Shira and Carol and Sarah Klugisch and all the folks in Medford who are working on this really important issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=815.082s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I learned two very important things from the Food Security Task Force when I attended their meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=821.124s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And one was that I said, you know, why don't you just call it hunger?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=825.962s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And you know, why do you keep calling it food insecurity?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=828.703s">[McLaughlin]</a>: What does that actually mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=829.764s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And they shared with me that we're all hungry every day, but food insecurity is very different than being hungry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=837.947s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Hungry, we know when our next meal is coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=840.669s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Food insecurity is when you don't know where your next meal is coming from and how you'll get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=845.071s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And that really stood out to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=846.411s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And also where they were sharing the one in nine Medford households experience food insecurity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=853.174s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And one of the things that the food,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=855.12s">[McLaughlin]</a>: task force really wanted to work on was de-stigmatizing food insecurity because often it's the case that we know people that are experiencing food insecurity and they're not sharing that with us because of the stigma attached to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=868.999s">[McLaughlin]</a>: having food insecurity and being hungry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=870.72s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I really applaud the work of the Food Security Task Force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=874.301s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And thank you, Mia, and all for bringing it forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=877.522s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I would encourage community members to attend the meetings and get involved as much as you can, because I know that none of us want to see a child hungry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=885.285s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=948.439s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1666.553s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank the students for coming out tonight and their family and say that I'm proud of you for your self-advocacy skills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1673.776s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Advocating and getting up in a microphone with lots of people looking at you in a whole room full of adults can be intimidating and it's really shows us all something that Medford should be proud of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1685.762s">[McLaughlin]</a>: teaching you all to do this, and we appreciate that you came out in front of everybody to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1691.684s">[McLaughlin]</a>: If I understood what you were saying correctly, you were looking for the retroactive for the $13 an hour that the mayor had, previous mayor, Mayor Burke, had suggested in January 2020 would be the current rate and a waiver of the certificate that you were wanting to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1713.212s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think those were the three items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1715.134s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Wanted to clarify on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1716.355s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then also wanted to make sure, Mayor Kern, that the students know what a committee of the whole meeting is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1724.081s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And maybe, I don't know if you want to explain that so that they could understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1727.424s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And that if you're interested in participating, that's a public meeting and something that you get to see a lot of what happens behind the scenes in those meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1735.65s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And they're good to come to to learn more as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1809.978s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So point of clarification, the committee of the whole meeting is actually going to be an executive committee meeting, not a committee of the whole meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1826.963s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But then the other parts are?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2148.377s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Just another point of clarification, I'm wondering how the students will be informed of the committee of the whole meeting date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2155.505s">[McLaughlin]</a>: They are posted online, but that means you have to go and look and check online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2159.689s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Is there a way that we can push information to the students and to the after school program about the date?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2520.037s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you for your report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2521.158s">[McLaughlin]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2521.999s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Tony.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2523.86s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I had a question on the communication that you sent out where<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2527.833s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It says federal officials are advising travelers who arrive in the US after February 2nd from mainland China to self-quarantine at home for 14 days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2535.659s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So this is getting to Member Ruseau's point about the self-quarantine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2540.302s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So do we have any mechanism in our school to understand if we have school community members that have traveled to China in the past 14 days?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2589.144s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And if I understand the correspondence, though, it's whether they're symptomatic or asymptomatic that they're recommending a 14-day self-quarantine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2596.747s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Is that right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2598.667s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Right, asymptomatic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2600.308s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2601.528s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so, but there's no real enforcement of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2604.149s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Is that accurate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2617.374s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Sure, of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2618.795s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But I mean, there's no, from the public health officials or anything like that, there's no way to track or enforce or anything like that, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2627.761s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Not to my knowledge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2632.885s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And is this more significant?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2634.366s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2635.743s">[McLaughlin]</a>: been watching it all on the news, because sometimes I feel like there can be elements of hysteria to these things, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2641.127s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But is there... There are a lot of elements to hysteria.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2644.689s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Is this different from a typical flu?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2673.908s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2674.348s">[McLaughlin]</a>: That helps, I think, with a little bit, perhaps, with the hysteria piece of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2678.009s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then is the symptomatic, are the symptoms, you know, more severe than the average flu or?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2683.79s">[McLaughlin]</a>: They tend to be lower respiratory symptoms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2705.868s">[McLaughlin]</a>: »» Thank you so much for your expertise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2708.029s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5276.53s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5278.551s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5279.011s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thanks for the report, Assistant Superintendent Patterson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5283.393s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I have a few questions on the resignation and retirements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5289.796s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It looks like since July, we've had<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5292.903s">[McLaughlin]</a>: eight paras retire or resign?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5296.845s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm wondering which those are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5299.146s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Are they resign or retire, or do you know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5303.949s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Resignations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5305.41s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And do you know, are we filling those positions, or what the status is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5313.253s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So are we down eight paras right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5315.675s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Do you know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5318.756s">[McLaughlin]</a>: How many are we down?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5325.781s">[McLaughlin]</a>: OK, so you've hired six of the eight that have, you've replaced six of the eight that have, OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5331.803s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so then for substitutes, for the daily substitutes, and the per diem substitutes, and the long term substitutes, I was given information, and I'm wondering if this is helpful or accurate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5344.088s">[McLaughlin]</a>: If there's a para that calls in sick to the special education classrooms,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5350.199s">[McLaughlin]</a>: the system comes up as no substitute required.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5353.541s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Is that accurate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5402.352s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So how does that work if there's an IEP that's requiring paras in the classroom, if the para's not being replaced if they're out sick?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5423.728s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But in terms of replacing substitutes in the classroom, so regarding the personnel report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5428.451s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So if a para's out, and they're saying no substitute required on the personnel list when a para calls in sick, there's no substitute going into that classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5441.007s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I guess these are also high needs classrooms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5443.248s">[McLaughlin]</a>: They're not gen ed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5488.087s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Sure, I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5489.247s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But is the system, is the software system coming up saying no substitute required, which obviously if that's what it's saying then there's definitely not going to be a substitute, never mind whether there are any<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5499.73s">[McLaughlin]</a>: available or not, that's what I'm asking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5505.293s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Are open no substitutes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5508.115s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Oh, open for substitutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5508.935s">[McLaughlin]</a>: In what instance would it say no substitute required?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5544.22s">[McLaughlin]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5545.061s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I guess I'm wondering, is it a personnel question or a special ed question that I should be directing this if there are high needs classrooms where a para is calling in sick and the personnel<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5555.726s">[McLaughlin]</a>: memo that comes up on the, whatever your software system is on the website, that says no substitute required.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5562.208s">[McLaughlin]</a>: How is that addressed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5564.108s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Would that be personnel?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5564.948s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Would that be special education?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5574.331s">[McLaughlin]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5574.871s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so who's we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5575.651s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We let you know if we see that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5580.492s">[McLaughlin]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5580.833s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So if powers are getting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5583.092s">[McLaughlin]</a>: If information is coming up when a para calls in sick and the system says no substitute required and we know it's a substantially separate or high needs classroom, they should be letting folks know that that's a glitch in the system and that shouldn't be happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5597.104s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Is that what I'm hearing you say?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5609.714s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5610.535s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6466.743s">[McLaughlin]</a>: A lot of hard work and work in progress, so thank you for the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6472.284s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I do have some questions around the equitable piece of it, and I appreciate you acknowledging that we're doing the best we can with what we have in terms of the programmatic elements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6481.407s">[McLaughlin]</a>: You had said that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6483.755s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We have to ensure that the children are going to the school that's most appropriate for their needs, which I think begs a bigger question in our district around equity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6492.341s">[McLaughlin]</a>: All of our schools should be able to deliver for each of our children's needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6496.904s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I know that that's a process that we're working towards and that I hope that the school committee continues to work towards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6502.368s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But I have questions in that realm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6504.73s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And we get a lot of these questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6506.011s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So getting back to what was happening last year with the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6509.193s">[McLaughlin]</a>: with the audit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6511.194s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Some of our schools have disproportionately more high-need students, whether they be English learners, students with disabilities, economically disadvantaged students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6519.899s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so if you're coming from a pool of elementary school students that have a higher population of high-need students, and then they're rounding out the number, or everyone's getting the same amount of students that are in the lottery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6535.449s">[McLaughlin]</a>: One school has a disproportionate amount of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6538.969s">[McLaughlin]</a>: English learners or students with disabilities, and then their numbers are skewed because they are going to a particular environment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6544.574s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so how is that being adjusted for is one question that I have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6549.478s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Another is we talk about sibling preference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6553.141s">[McLaughlin]</a>: What happens if you have a sibling that is a student with a disability that's going to a programmatic piece?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6558.606s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Or if you have a sibling who you've aged out of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6563.476s">[McLaughlin]</a>: specific English learner program that might be applied for that program or for that school and you're going to another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6569.857s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So how are we addressing sibling preference for our students with high needs or that have siblings with high needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6576.399s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then the third is what if students are identified after the fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6581.96s">[McLaughlin]</a>: What if you know the lottery happens and they're enrolled into a school and then they're subsequently identified as having a particular disability or they enroll into our schools initially and they're in one school<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6593.749s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then they're subsequently identified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6595.39s">[McLaughlin]</a>: How are we addressing that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6596.211s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Are we taking them out of a school mid-year to deal with programmatic elements?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6601.035s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Or how is that being addressed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6726.874s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6729.415s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Oh, it was just how are we going to address the equity for students with high needs so that if we're being random and trying to be equitable across the schools, that we're not addressing all of the students in terms of the equity for the lottery because of the programmatic elements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6742.284s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But I think that's probably a much bigger question than you can address tonight, Dr. O'Keefe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6787.593s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So could we get comparable data, or perhaps this is a motion that I need to make for comparable data on those populations so we can see what that distribution is among our schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6803.28s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Well, the economic, yeah, sure, if we have the data, economically disadvantaged, but also our students with disabilities and our English learners, like what's the distribution across the schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6811.662s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so for the, if we know that the McGlynn is getting all of our English learners, then clearly they're going to have a higher need for English learners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6819.744s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So then equity is not that everybody gets the same, it's that everybody gets what they need, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6825.586s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So if we know that the McGlynn's going to have a higher need, are they getting more resources to support their need?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6831.893s">[McLaughlin]</a>: versus other schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6833.215s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I guess I'm looking for similar data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6835.457s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I guess I'm making a motion that if we could, this is a great report, if we could have, make a motion to have the same sort of data breakout for our students with disabilities, our English learners, and our economically disadvantaged among the middle schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6850.832s">[McLaughlin]</a>: If we could do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6851.813s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I make a motion for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6854.375s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6855.276s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7032.192s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you just point of clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7034.312s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Are you asking for this member Graham annually and then also for the sub lottery?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7039.073s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Can you qualify what you mean by that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7424.636s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you, Assistant Superintendent Caldwell for this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7429.898s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And the flyer looks great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7430.898s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm happy to see the child care interpreter available by request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7434.859s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I really appreciate at the bottom of the flyer for the Medford Family Network that the interpretation services are actually offered in the language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7445.027s">[McLaughlin]</a>: of folks, or at least three of the languages folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7448.468s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I'm wondering, can that information also be shared on our website if it's not already?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7453.53s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Okay, so in the language that folks need for the number?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7456.771s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7456.891s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7457.771s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then for the health department document, folks will get that translated as needed based on whether they let you know that they need translation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8056.89s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I also support the resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8058.251s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8058.651s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I just, um, I'm wondering though, um, um, assistant superintendent call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8064.114s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Well, do we have data on how many kindergartners there are and how many were actually<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8070.461s">[McLaughlin]</a>: are choosing Medford Public Schools or choosing other schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8073.722s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Do we even know that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8084.984s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So we don't even know, really, how much money we may or may not be losing, or do we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8090.566s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Because we have to pay it, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8092.686s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8093.166s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So we know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8094.987s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So are we getting retroactive data on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8098.108s">[McLaughlin]</a>: That's what I'm asking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8099.168s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Not to my knowledge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8100.262s">[McLaughlin]</a>: No, that would be interesting too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8107.568s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But it would be good for the school committee to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8110.891s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And frankly, the staff and assistant superintendent and principals, if we're talking about what these numbers really are translating into, and people should know how great our schools are, because we do, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8125.423s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8127.265s">[McLaughlin]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8228.072s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Just a point of clarification, since the data is available or if it's available, that it could be referred to the subcommittee on this matter so that we could further drill down into that as we're making some planning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10332.572s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you all very much for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10334.653s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I can see that there's a lot of hard work put into it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10337.536s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I love the edgespeak, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10339.317s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We've had lots of conversations about that over time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10343.947s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Send it to all the grad schools around town, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10346.148s">[McLaughlin]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10347.548s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But no, the edgespeak is really important, especially when families are having conversations and the acronyms roll off our tongues like we don't even notice anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10357.553s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And it's really important for people to be able to stop and remind us that we can tell them what those acronyms mean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10363.876s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So thank you for including that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10365.537s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think the hyperlinks are really great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10367.658s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm glad to see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10368.318s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm excited that I'm also on the subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10370.598s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I'll be excited to be working with folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10372.681s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I did have a couple of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10373.702s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I wanted to ask how you guys were chosen as district administrators to work on this particular strategic plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10382.419s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Was it, did you self-select, did they volunteer, self-select, were you chosen, like how did that work?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10387.803s">[McLaughlin]</a>: What was that process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10412.782s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Especially when you're wordsmithing everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10728.632s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, I just had a small point of,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10732.762s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I guess a question, and I'm sure you guys, some of you guys have thought about this, but I'm wondering how you're going to address it or how you want the community to address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10739.485s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So the acronym's great for the strategic plan, but as you know, especially Stacey, that that has a whole other meaning in childhood trauma.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10748.829s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so how do we, how, you know, I think about the differentiation of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10752.95s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So ACES is also the Adverse Childhood Experience Study, which is a very large study on childhood trauma and the effects of childhood trauma on, you know, children's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10762.441s">[McLaughlin]</a>: long-term effects on their lives and so on and so forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10765.102s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So did that come up in your conversations at all?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10826.971s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10968.114s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10971.65s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Regarding communications, a few things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10974.411s">[McLaughlin]</a>: One was I wanted to make a motion for school committee member updates as part of our weekly or bi-monthly meetings so that the community and each other can know what each school committee member is working on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10990.719s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I'm making a motion under the communications to have school committee member updates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11004.028s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I have another motion under communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11007.829s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11010.25s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I've been coming to meetings for years in the audience and I appreciate those of you that are still out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11016.632s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11017.512s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I know how tiring it can be sitting out there and watching all night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11021.892s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But there's been a lot of conversation over years about providing materials that are in our packets to the public whenever possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11030.783s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So obviously we wouldn't be providing materials that are confidential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11034.168s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But there's a lot of material here that's very useful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11037.988s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I also wanted to ask if we could get a copy of the PowerPoint from tonight, just because it's helpful for referencing in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11044.134s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But I'd like to make a motion that we are able to create weekly school committee packets for the community that are online and available, so that the community can access what we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11056.086s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Because having sat on the other side of that railing, I know that you're getting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11060.956s">[McLaughlin]</a>: bits and pieces of the information, but it's really helpful to have things in front of you or to be able to look at it in advance so that if you have any questions in the future and so I'm making a motion to put that material online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11187.632s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11187.932s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think that it's reasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11190.074s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I assume that the reports are being provided electronically, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11194.698s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So not printed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11195.558s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So that, I mean, I'm just imagining that if there's a, and again, I'm not sure of processes, but if there's a, an electronic report that's going to administration, then once the report is reviewed, obviously by, by central administration, what have you, then it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11209.969s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It also gets forwarded to the webmaster or whoever to put together these packets that can be available by Monday or whenever so that people have it before the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11220.013s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I wouldn't expect simultaneously, but I'm assuming the reports are all sent electronically anyway, so it's sort of just another step in procedure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11226.455s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And maybe it goes to the policy subcommittee just to figure out what the actual procedure is, what that looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11236.018s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I'm happy to refer it to that just in terms of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11239.392s">[McLaughlin]</a>: how we want to step it so that you have a timeline that's reasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11243.414s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Because we definitely aren't interested in giving people more work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11246.795s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm not interested in giving people more work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11248.296s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I really just want to share information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11249.816s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11251.237s">[McLaughlin]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11252.017s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11403.476s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you, Member van der Kloot, for the information on the enhanced reading this Wednesday for the curriculum subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11415.12s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I'm assuming that that's this Wednesday this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11419.181s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's not Wednesdays all the time, or?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11421.962s">[McLaughlin]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11423.423s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, just want to make sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11424.343s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm thinking of CPAC and other things that are happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11429.975s">[McLaughlin]</a>: No, not this week, second Wednesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11432.477s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11433.418s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then the other is regarding the high school vision committee and the 41 applicants when you're talking about there's 11 to 13 and you want it to be as fair as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11443.546s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So to that end, are you thinking about, I'm wondering how that fairness is possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11449.451s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Is it a lottery?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11450.272s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Is it you're looking at different age levels?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11453.655s">[McLaughlin]</a>: You're looking at different schools, grades, like how?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11533.081s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11533.941s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So, um, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11535.962s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I just have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11536.742s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So if the rules and so, so what I'm understanding this is saying is that, um, the rules policy and equity subcommittee will make, will help devise policy on how reports are requested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11550.466s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Um, is that accurate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11686.197s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11692.322s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11693.463s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, that's good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11695.365s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So, but I'm assuming there'll be a process for whatever reports were requested, obviously, as well, that there's a timeline or whatever, because a lot of these are from... And again, since they're from 2019,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11707.034s">[McLaughlin]</a>: at this point, it's come back to November of 2019, or April, or October, or whatever, 2019, that there'll be questions, like you said, there'll be some documentation of why these reports were requested, and that's reported out to the public about why the reports are being requested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11750.876s">[McLaughlin]</a>: No, I wouldn't imagine that you'd get the list of the actual students, but I think that is really interesting information just in terms of how many, how much, you know, other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11758.477s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But so, okay, so there's going to be a process is sort of what I'm understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11762.58s">[McLaughlin]</a>: instead of just asking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11763.542s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So that's helpful and I assume that that process will include a timeline and reporting out to the public as the subcommittee would need to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11770.373s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Is that right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11778.308s">[McLaughlin]</a>: and the subcommittee will report out that rule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11781.129s">[McLaughlin]</a>: The recommendation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11781.989s">[McLaughlin]</a>: To this recommendation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11913.075s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But also, yeah, so that I'm just asking here's a stick and I'm sorry, it's just.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11919.701s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So this tell me when you tell me OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11927.928s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yep, now I see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11929.517s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11929.837s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11931.738s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So this would be an example of in the future or something that would have to go through this, the policy, what, yeah, the rules, this request, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11945.506s">[McLaughlin]</a>: That resolution that the mayor offered for the report on dyslexia, that would be one, again, that would not be offered in this format.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11953.731s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It would be offered in whatever the policy subcommittee or rules subcommittee decides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11962.738s">[McLaughlin]</a>: No, but I just mean in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11964.919s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm trying to use an example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11968.121s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Is that right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=12199.144s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=12200.204s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I had had an agenda request for a school safety procedural update be added to the agenda and it was unfortunately put under requested reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=12211.389s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm not looking for a report per se.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=12213.67s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm looking for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=12214.79s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I hope that doesn't constitute a report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=12217.332s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But I think given the circumstances of the past two weeks with the question of, you know, process and protocol around this unidentified powder, which thankfully was resolved, and thank you all for your hard work on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=12232.906s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I know that was a lot of hours and energy and input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=12238.17s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But understanding, and I think it's a longer conversation<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=12269.514s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=12269.995s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So this had also been our first school committee meeting as a new member had the list of requested reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=12276.939s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Our second did not have them on the agenda anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=12280.042s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then I was curious about what that was and where the status of the outstanding reports are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=12285.625s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But since this topic is being moved to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=12288.567s">[McLaughlin]</a>: the Rules, Policy and Equity Subcommittee of which I am a member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=12294.432s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I am okay with moving this topic there and figuring out how we report to the public on these outstanding reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=883.376s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=884.177s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you for that thorough report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=887.479s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member Van der Kloot, I was wondering about the growing up and staying healthy Michigan model health curriculum with supplements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=895.624s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Are those supplements regarding students with disabilities or EL learners?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=899.987s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Do you know what the supplements are?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=932.864s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=933.504s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=934.045s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so I'm wondering about the special education and EL access for the curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=938.768s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I know, aside from scheduling, I'm talking really content.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=942.331s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=942.491s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Perry, if you can help with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=943.572s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=945.093s">[McLaughlin]</a>: You know, is it driven by, I guess that's question number one, and question number two would be that I don't know if the scheduling thing is driven by IEP goals, so if there are parents watching and they feel that their middle schoolers need sex education, they might be thinking about what the IEP, or any health education, what the IEP goals are to reflect that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=962.757s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Is that how it's driven, or?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=995.591s">[McLaughlin]</a>: For the English learners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1008.913s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1009.493s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1056.31s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1061.814s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Melanie McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1313.603s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I understand and respect our co-members' positions, but I think that this is an important topic, at least for the rest of us to understand, especially as I'm considering our learners who are more vulnerable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1324.611s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And that doesn't necessarily mean that our parents want to automatically opt out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1328.194s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It just means that we want to be aware of and understand how this will be presented in a way that's differentiated, which I know we don't won't know that yet because we won't know how you're doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1337.71s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But I certainly want to see the big picture around like where we're going and how<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1341.974s">[McLaughlin]</a>: that's going to work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1343.595s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So respectfully, I would say that I'm happy to take the time over the two weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1349.219s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm certainly not going to read every single line item, but I want to have a broad understanding and picture of what it is that we're presenting to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1356.564s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I would make a motion to, or second your motion to table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2123.254s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2125.094s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I appreciate the conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2126.435s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I was on the subcommittee, and this is why it's so good to have the conversation after subcommittee, because other things come up, and we get an idea of what questions we maybe didn't vet in the subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2137.378s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So one thing that's come up to me and might come up for community members is, what happens when there's obviously, say, a really pressing issue, like we have a pressing issue,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2150.297s">[McLaughlin]</a>: that's come up in the community and we have an agenda list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2153.32s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We just, what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2155.341s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, like a coronavirus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2156.903s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I didn't want to say it, but yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2159.124s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Like something like that, that's sort of a pressing issue and sort of, you know, prioritizes over all the other agenda items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2165.83s">[McLaughlin]</a>: What is the process for that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2167.171s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And should, and if there's not one, should we be including one in the subcommittee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2177.253s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2177.593s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then so, and then maybe including in the policy what that process is so that, you know, for notification for, you know, whether things get rippled down or totally re assigned or, or why I just think we should be thinking about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2237.313s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Point of information, Member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2239.914s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Point of information, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2242.175s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But I guess the question was then how it ripples down for the others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2245.356s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So how is that affected?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2246.856s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I thought the point was that we were going to be knowing ahead of time what was on the agenda and how things rippled through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2253.018s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So obviously if the superintendent or chair have things that they're including on the agenda,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2257.932s">[McLaughlin]</a>: that also includes our line items, our agenda items that were put in with these great notations that we have next to them about who submitted what and when and all those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2267.796s">[McLaughlin]</a>: How then is it after they've put their things on the agenda and an emergency comes up, how then is it addressed and communicated to everybody to know what is in fact on the agenda, what's not, what's going to be reprioritized, and what's not?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2881.747s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes, thank you for the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2883.367s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Actually, I was going to say maybe we could, if Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2886.908s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Ronay wants to type those up and send them to us, would that be better or easier?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2890.789s">[McLaughlin]</a>: No, that's OK to just use that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2891.79s">[McLaughlin]</a>: OK, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2892.93s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I guess we can take the time to review and ask that it be put on the next agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2906.284s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Maybe a subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2908.144s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2909.085s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Subcommittee for this disability special education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2911.865s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I ask that this be moved to the subcommittee for the special education and behavioral health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2923.668s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2928.669s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So we'll be in touch with you from that subcommittee to follow up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2933.01s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=3032.83s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=3033.53s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Lerner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=3034.171s">[McLaughlin]</a>: This was an important point and one that was brought up before this meeting as well by both community members and school committee members who are concerned about this for the vision committee too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=3045.698s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so the process was such that the applications were, for lack of a better word, blind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=3052.002s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So there was no indication, partially of the differences in capabilities or abilities or race<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=3060.973s">[McLaughlin]</a>: ethnicities or economic backgrounds or what have you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=3063.495s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think that that is a place to start in terms of where we're thinking about being proactive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=3068.798s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think we clearly have work to do to be able to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=3072.641s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But I'm glad to say that I believe that we are reaching out to several groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=3079.164s">[McLaughlin]</a>: and stakeholders in the community to add some folks to the vision committee so that we are being more aware of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=3085.567s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And in the future, moving forward, I think that that's something that, especially with community members like yourself coming to the podium and people emailing us and other items, that this will be something that will be done proactively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=3096.992s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So we thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=3224.818s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I just wanted, as a point of information, to add an apology to the community that that wasn't considered in advance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=3231.162s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And we'll make sure that we are more proactive about that in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=3234.223s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=3322.438s">[McLaughlin]</a>: all these years and for our families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=3324.059s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I'm sure that there are parents here who you were in the schools while they were educated and appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=3330.344s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And we all appreciate your service and thank you very much for your time here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=3334.867s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And we know we'll see you in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=3336.949s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4245.356s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you for the update, Superintendent Edward-Vincent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4248.297s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I just had a couple of community members that asked questions, and I wanted to ask and clarify if we could for the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4258.6s">[McLaughlin]</a>: First, I want to say thank you, especially<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4262.041s">[McLaughlin]</a>: to all of you, but also to Dr. Cushion for his work in keeping folks updated on social media and providing the frequently asked questions listing and to the mayor's office for doing that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4274.656s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's a really important list that folks can access, especially around, I had some folks calling me about compromised and vulnerable populations and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4282.028s">[McLaughlin]</a>: and our student population and what they should do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4283.949s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So they should definitely be going to the frequently asked questions on the website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4288.111s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And there's information there as well as provided by our nurse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4290.892s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But regarding the cleaners coming, the outside cleaners coming in, I think there was correspondence that went out last week, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4298.675s">[McLaughlin]</a>: that said that there was going to be a deep cleaning or a thorough cleaning over the weekend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4302.616s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And can we just clarify for the community that that didn't happen and that it didn't happen because the, if the information I have is right, that it didn't happen because of the scarcity of the outside cleaners, but that it will be happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4315.799s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Is that right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4316.199s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4317.62s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4369.218s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4369.598s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I just wanted that for the clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4371.299s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And thank you, Mr. McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4372.54s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think I was told that this agent, this cleaning agent might like folks might come into the school or to the classroom and still see, you know, say dust or what have you in the, in the, in the area because the deep cleaning didn't happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4384.668s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But this agent is a misting agent that would sort of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4387.438s">[McLaughlin]</a>: go over the dust and still sanitize, if you would, I don't know, I guess the dust.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4516.846s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And while we, well, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4518.728s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And while you're here, can I just ask also that I'm assuming that there's soap in all the bathrooms?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5532.486s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you, I wanted to thank our health professionals for all your support right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5536.487s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I know this is a crazy hectic time for you guys and appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5541.588s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I also wanted to, the mayor's point on the Wednesday emergency preparedness meeting, we have a universal safety committee that's been working in our schools for the past two years and we meet monthly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5553.71s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And we started meeting quarterly with the leadership teams as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5558.091s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And we are hosting a safety night on April 28th<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5562.908s">[McLaughlin]</a>: at the McGlynn Auditorium from six to eight, where we'll be talking about these very things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5568.689s">[McLaughlin]</a>: What do you do in a man-made disaster, a natural disaster?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5572.25s">[McLaughlin]</a>: What do we do with our vulnerable populations?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5574.291s">[McLaughlin]</a>: How do we prepare in advance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5576.371s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But that's been in the works for the past couple of months, so folks should know that that's happening and that we are proactive about looking at safety for all our students and thinking about how we're thinking again about those most vulnerable populations<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5590.578s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I appreciated your quick response on our medically fragile students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5594.76s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And we hear all the time about this COV, whatever, coronavirus, COVID-19, about how it affects our most vulnerable populations more even than our typically healthy population.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5611.409s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So really being aware and mindful of that is important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5613.871s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I appreciated your quick response on that, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5616.632s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Ray.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5616.832s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5618.888s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7577.862s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I wanted to offer my condolences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7579.783s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7580.463s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I know what a drag that is and that real first taste of disappointment that you get as a young person is so palpable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7590.008s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's just really sad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7591.409s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm sorry for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7593.25s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I also wanted to ask from your perspective and from the superintendent's perspective whether a letter from the school committee also expressing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7603.995s">[McLaughlin]</a>: our disappointment in both the travel policy and the airline, and also how this is affecting our students, and also the cost benefit that we're saving, really, included in that letter, whether that might be helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7628.294s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I make a motion that we provide a letter from the school committee as well, supporting any remuneration we can get from these agencies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7637.097s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I know that the superintendent is going to be charged with that, but I think also having a collective voice from the school committee and letting folks know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7643.059s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then I wonder if there's an opportunity, I know that folks said that the superintendents across the state, Dr. Riccadeli, you were saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7649.79s">[McLaughlin]</a>: are talking about it, so maybe there's an opportunity to also address the Mass Association of School Superintendents and ask if they would collectively be willing to write a letter to, you know, as a whole, either to Governor Baker or to the travel agencies so that we're supporting each other in this movement, because it is a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7736.353s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7739.119s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I made a motion to write a letter from the school committee to the travel agency, to Delta Airlines, and to others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7845.213s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I wanted to amend it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7848.916s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I wanted to amend the motion to offer students the opportunity to co-sign on to the letter if they want, if you would be willing to facilitate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7856.964s">[McLaughlin]</a>: If we got you a copy of the letter and we wanted to have a signature page for the students or their families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7861.347s">[McLaughlin]</a>: welcome that, and then we can, and I'm happy to, you know, facilitate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7865.11s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I don't mean to give you or anybody else extra work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7867.532s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm happy to type up a letter and pass it along, whatever, if it's helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7871.055s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But, and collecting students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=7872.677s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I'll make the motion to have a letter from the school committee that can also be signed by students and their families to the governor, to the airlines, and to the travel agency to try to get money back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=8498.013s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=8501.255s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So moving this to the subcommittee for engagement, we know that this, it's March 9th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=8511.204s">[McLaughlin]</a>: This is April 1.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=8513.345s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We have a timeline of getting our, whatever family and community engagement we're able to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=8520.45s">[McLaughlin]</a>: achieve between March 9th and our next school committee meeting to have this budget, I mean, to have this report approved before it's sent to DESE, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=8530.019s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So that's, what are those school days?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=8534.002s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So what's that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=8535.243s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Our next meeting is the 23rd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=8536.525s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so what are the school days?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=8537.606s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So from the net, from... So we have 10 days to engage the, to meaningfully engage the community with our stakeholder<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=8547.554s">[McLaughlin]</a>: groups that are our most high need stakeholder groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=8550.478s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So our English learners, our individual families of children with disabilities, and our economically disadvantaged students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=8558.669s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm just asking, do people really think that that's meaningful engagement for those stakeholder groups?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=8635.493s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Interestingly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=8636.253s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=8636.794s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So that would be something that I would ask, whether it's an amendment to the motion or a separate motion, is that we actually ask DESE for an extension so that we can meaningfully engage our community and our families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=8648.781s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think, you know, speaking as a family of a child with a disability and knowing the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=8654.139s">[McLaughlin]</a>: extra demands that are put on our families with children with disabilities and the extra demands that are put on our families that are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=8660.464s">[McLaughlin]</a>: second language and our extra demands that are put on our families that are working two or three jobs, I don't think it's reasonable to expect that we're going to respond to a survey in 10 days because of a deadline that's being presented to us based on whether it's $100,000 or $10 million, how it's going to be spent in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=8676.634s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think that we should be asking, if we're not prepared to do that, which I would say, I'd venture to say, 10 days is not meaningful family engagement, then we should be asking for an extension on this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=8781.542s">[McLaughlin]</a>: have to say that, you know, when we're talking on the other side of the budget and we're talking about $130,000, everybody's talking about how much money that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=8790.227s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And whether it's in comparison to a school district that's getting $10 million or us that are getting $130,000, it's still $130,000 that families should be engaged in about how they're being, it's being spent in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=8803.015s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think it has to be meaningful engagement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=8805.656s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I have to say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=8807.076s">[McLaughlin]</a>: you know, that I don't find this meaningfully engaging families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=8811.177s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think that it's reasonable to say that we have some work to do on family engagement as a whole, which is why we have a subcommittee on community engagement, and that, you know, I'm happy to be a part of, and I think that this is work that needs to be forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=8822.919s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But I think that this body needs to think a little bit more thoughtfully, respectfully, about how we can really expect to engage these marginalized families within a 10-day deadline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9130.376s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I also feel like it's sort of a little bit of what we heard earlier from the community about having a number of, frankly, white engaged families around the table making decisions for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9143.291s">[McLaughlin]</a>: brown and black and disengaged families who aren't around the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9147.133s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I don't feel comfortable doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9149.274s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I do feel like we really should be thinking about how this is affecting our families and whether it's, and I understand it's, you know, robbing Peter to pay Paul, if you will, in terms of moving money around and what have you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9161.119s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But this Student Opportunity Act is explicitly requiring us to have those engagements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9166.702s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And even if it's in this one paragraph<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9169.341s">[McLaughlin]</a>: where we're talking about reaching out to CPAC, or we're talking about reaching out to the LPAC, which the LPAC is barely existing, is existent at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9178.065s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And again, those are our already engaged families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9181.387s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so how are we thinking about how we're representing this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9184.489s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think that, okay, it's not reasonable for DESE to be asking this, and we all understand that it's not reasonable for DESE, and it's not fair that Winchester's getting more money than Medford is, or whatever else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9196.007s">[McLaughlin]</a>: At a minimum, we have to be thinking at this subcommittee, if we're doing this in the next 10 days, who are we engaging in this community that is going to be very representative of those people?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9205.629s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And we should not be, frankly, sitting here discussing it amongst ourselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9209.71s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think that we have to be thinking like tonight, who are we engaging and who are we bringing to the table on this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9216.952s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Because I think we're hearing far too often from our community members that we are not engaging these constituents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9222.173s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And to say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9223.154s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Like that our PTOs, while our PTOs are great and they're doing a lot of work in our schools, our PTOs are our already engaged family members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9230.72s">[McLaughlin]</a>: They're not the people who aren't able to come to the PTOs because they're working two or three jobs or because they have children with disabilities at home or because they don't speak English and don't feel comfortable or what have you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9241.249s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So the other thing is, how are we translating the survey?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9244.111s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I appreciate that you're ready to send a survey out, and I think that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9247.454s">[McLaughlin]</a>: How is the survey being translated?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9248.895s">[McLaughlin]</a>: How is it going to be getting to these families?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9250.316s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I mean, these are all really<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9252.859s">[McLaughlin]</a>: important questions that I just feel like, you know, I would rather say to Dessie, no, we're not submitting this plan April 1, because you didn't give us enough time to really meaningfully engage this constituency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9264.821s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And if you don't like it, sorry, but that's where we're at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9267.682s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'd rather say that to the commissioner than try to give us 10 days at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9272.683s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We won't even, I mean, if they want to say, well, you've had since February 18th, well, you know, there's been some things going on, whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9279.164s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We've had people resign.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9280.825s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We've had coronavirus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9281.785s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We've had whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9283.26s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's not reasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9405.134s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Point of clarification, member Laughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9406.275s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So yes, and I would also encourage any folks that are watching from home out there or what have you that are these marginalized communities to reach out to this body, to this constituency to let us know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9417.895s">[McLaughlin]</a>: that you want to be involved and how you can get in and you'd like to have your voices heard and ways in which we can engage you further to make sure that these funds are being spent appropriately for those high needs families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9430.907s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think that, again, respectfully to the committee, if we're talking about how these funds need to be spent, I think it's pretty clear it needs to be family and community engagement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9439.958s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And that's just, again, my two cents, because we're already talking about how we don't have family and community engagement, and here's money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9446.321s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then we're talking about, well, how else can we spend this money that we don't have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9450.222s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I just think it's a circular conversation, and just had to add that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9453.423s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But I appreciate your work, Dr. Cushing, as always.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9456.265s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I appreciate you taking our phone calls and clarifying questions for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9460.746s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And clearly, I feel passionately about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9463.287s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I hope you don't take any of my passion personally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9465.989s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But I feel that this is an important matter, and I wanted to speak up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9469.27s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9516.454s">[McLaughlin]</a>: No, I will table that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9519.255s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I will table that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9824.721s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I had some questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9826.623s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I was also part of this conversation and I think it's really important for the community to understand that the opportunity at the McGlynn is a unique one in that we're bringing in a person or an entity to look at this playground space and to consider how we're making<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9843.717s">[McLaughlin]</a>: what would amount to be the first inclusive play space in Medford, which is a big deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9849.16s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So by inclusive, that's thinking about, as member Graham was saying, children of all abilities and backgrounds, and that they have expertise in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9857.145s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And there's a line item in there that there's an expert in inclusive play and play spaces, which I much appreciate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9863.629s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think it's very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9865.15s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I would also encourage Dr. Cushing to, same as with our other committees, as we heard tonight, to be thinking about how we're addressing diversity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9873.253s">[McLaughlin]</a>: in our selection for committee members, and I would also advocate for a person with a disability, or somebody from the Disabilities Commission, or somebody with a disability from the Disabilities Commission to be on this committee, especially if we're thinking about how we're including children with disabilities in this playground space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9900.686s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So is that an amendment, or I request an amendment to this, or?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2846.034s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2847.434s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you for the report, Bernadette and Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2850.535s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Nyland, and thank you for your hard work on this for families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2853.737s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm wondering how have you informed families of this and how they've responded?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2858.198s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think this is great news when we thought we weren't getting anything back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2860.979s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Of course, getting this good portion of it back is great news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2867.621s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's unfortunate that families have to lose $500 at all, as we all know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2872.733s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Under the circumstances, I think it's pretty remarkable that you guys were able to do what you did and the insurance company was able to do what they did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2879.585s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=2880.928s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I'm just wondering if you've had any response or feedback from families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3289.082s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Can I also ask just one question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3291.023s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's Melanie McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3293.376s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3293.576s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3295.297s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3295.858s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm also just wondering how are, um, I know that parents have the opt out, um, option and how are they given the scope and scale of what will actually be taught?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3305.524s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Like, are they given the same information that were given, um, for the grades?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3320.666s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And is it automatic to opt in unless you opt out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3324.228s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Is that how it works?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3325.329s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3326.97s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3943.505s">[McLaughlin]</a>: America learn longer current.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3947.086s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes So that was something I had on and I am gonna make a motion that that be moved to the rules and policy subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3988.972s">[McLaughlin]</a>: This was also me, Mayor Lungo-Koehn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3991.755s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3992.695s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so, again, I would also request, especially with the proposed reports, that this be moved to the policy and rules subcommittee, of which I'm also a member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4004.861s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But the idea would be that we would review what the requests were and see if there's any that we need to, you know, that if we can't find the institutional knowledge around, that we need to come back to the committee and ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4020.582s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I have a motion to move to the rules and policy subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4128.607s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes, and I would just add that, you know, I appreciated the superintendent reaching out to us in the last meeting asking this subcommittee folks to get in touch with her to schedule the meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4140.631s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We're really trying to limit the meeting times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4143.632s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I know for our subcommittee for special education was actually joined with another entire huge topic, which is behavioral health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4152.754s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We haven't even had the opportunity to meet yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4155.335s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We do need to at least bring those people to the tables to identify<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4158.834s">[McLaughlin]</a>: goals and strategy for next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4160.815s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So again, but we're trying very much to limit those meetings in the one that I scheduled to one hour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4167.037s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I wouldn't expect that would have an additional one necessarily by the end of the year, unless something substantial changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4177.241s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But in any case, I would say that we still need to have the subcommittee meetings, especially since we didn't get to have one before all of this stuff happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4430.312s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes, I actually had a motion to withdraw your motion to table member Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4435.378s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I wasn't tabling it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4442.4s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4443.481s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I also just wanted to ask, and I'm not sure if this is amendment or what, but asking that the call for members is inclusive and that we are respectful of diversity as we're approaching that call for the advisory, because I'm sure that we are, Dr. Cushing, but I just like to put it out there to make sure that we are soliciting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4468.646s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I would defer to folks from all members of our community for those respective positions, and we can talk more about what that looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4479.17s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I would defer to folks in the mayor's office as well about how we're actually reaching the constituents for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4940.077s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=311.034s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'll have a question, but I'm going to wait until the dialogue starts a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=314.796s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But I do have some questions, but I'd like to just let things roll, if you don't mind, first, before I start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=320.238s">[McLaughlin]</a>: That's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=332.442s">[McLaughlin]</a>: You mean raise hands through the participants, Paul, or through physically?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=505.122s">[McLaughlin]</a>: You say yes to me, Paul?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=509.084s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=510.645s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So yeah, to Mr. DeLava's point, I guess that raises a good question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=515.228s">[McLaughlin]</a>: What if you have two students, for example, that do get in a fight, and we did do indoor suspension, or there was an indoor suspension?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=524.873s">[McLaughlin]</a>: How would that address, I guess, or we would need to address those students<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=529.352s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I would imagine not being together in an indoor, you know, I don't even know if you're going to call it suspension, but, um, or maybe they would be in a restorative justice circle or, I don't know, I guess I'm just curious, how would you respond, um, to that as an example?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=571.218s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=571.698s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So then I guess, thank you, Mr. Downs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=573.3s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Um, and I didn't know who was speaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=575.021s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So also it might be helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=576.662s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I was looking for you on my screen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=577.783s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=578.224s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I just, I'm double screening cause I'm taking my apologies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=581.246s">[McLaughlin]</a>: No, that's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=582.147s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So maybe we can just ask folks to, um, you know, before they speak, just maybe say their name and what their role is would be helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=588.572s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Um, and I'm going to try to do my best with taking these minutes to Paul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=591.614s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So, so maybe some elaboration on if it's not a suspension,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=596.929s">[McLaughlin]</a>: we're not doing, you know, if we're considering not having suspension for obvious reasons with disproportionality, what might consequences, if that's the right word, logical consequences or otherwise look like instead?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=789.386s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=792.388s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Can you do me a favor and actually share, or I think it would be helpful to maybe read the resolution one more time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=799.494s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I wish I had it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=800.335s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I was trying to, when you were talking, I was typing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=802.557s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm not going to do that again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=803.958s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But maybe the last part of the resolution so I can, it would just help me as we're talking, just if you wouldn't mind, just one more time, just the last part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=814.136s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I had all the whereas, whereas, whereas, but the summary of the, or the outcome that you're looking for, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=945.578s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Excuse me one second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=946.419s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Point of information, Paul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=947.739s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Can you stop sharing the screen now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=949.2s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Because I can't take notes when you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=950.761s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1307.685s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Point of information, would you guys mind sharing that screen for one second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1389.361s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think I saw Mr. Blough, yeah, I think I saw Mr. Blough cut his hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1393.183s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I don't know, Paul, if you wanna.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1395.585s">[McLaughlin]</a>: calling him, but I also have another follow-up to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1397.706s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Jenny, thank you for sharing the screen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1398.966s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Don't take it away yet, please, because I want to comment on something there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1404.207s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Do you want to go first, Mr. Blauck, or do you want me to go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1810.772s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1811.832s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And to that end, to Paul's point, I also want to point out the data here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1818.672s">[McLaughlin]</a>: that 84% of 112, so about 80% of these discipline suspensions are students, high-need students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1835.021s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So students with disabilities, economically disadvantaged English learners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1839.904s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And that is, again, another data point that's really important to look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1844.226s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So looking at the 62%<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1846.813s">[McLaughlin]</a>: persons of color and more than 80% or 80% high needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1851.536s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so what is the intersectionality around addressing the social emotional component of this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1857.24s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I know that Stacey Shulman has her hand raised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1859.922s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I'll be curious to hear that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1861.083s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But as we're addressing trauma, as we're addressing social emotional needs of children, and again, getting back to some of that implicit bias around that, what that looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1870.669s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And, you know, a student who is experiencing a lot of aggression at home and then comes into school and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1876.837s">[McLaughlin]</a>: you know, maybe has a teacher or someone that is, seems threatening or aggressive to them and they explode, you know, we understand that that can be a root cause of trauma.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1887.965s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So, but the data does speak volumes in that 80% of our students that are getting disciplined are high needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1895.791s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so I would love for folks to talk about that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1908.134s">[McLaughlin]</a>: 84 out of 112?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1923.905s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Except it's not because it's 11.5 plus 15 plus 11.5 for the high need, well it depends on the students with disabilities<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1932.992s">[McLaughlin]</a>: and the economically disadvantaged are also in the high needs 11.5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1948.143s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So the 15.8 and the 12.3 are the equivalent of the 11.5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1950.805s">[McLaughlin]</a>: That's the way I'm looking at it right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1958.251s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Well, then how can it, if it's students disciplined and 84 of them are high needs and the total students disciplined are 112, that's not 11%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1990.908s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you, Jenny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1992.329s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I was saying approximately 80, looking at 84 to the 112.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1995.952s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1996.432s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But it's actually 75% because Jenny, you know, used her calculator or her brain and did the math.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2000.955s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2001.295s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Calculator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2002.916s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I was like, I assume calculator, but I didn't want to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2005.758s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2007.019s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So that's a really, that's an important point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2009.56s">[McLaughlin]</a>: 75% of them are high needs of the students who are being disciplined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2016.704s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And again, it goes to the same point that member Rousseau is saying, you know, are we saying that students who have high needs are, you know, require discipline more than students who don't?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2026.829s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Maybe, and maybe again, you know, Stacey Shulman can speak to that, but maybe suspension isn't the way to address that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2033.853s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I'm done now, but I wanted to just point out that data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2036.814s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then I am going to ask if everyone's okay, Paul, that you stop sharing the screen just so I can go back to my Word document to take notes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2042.978s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2784.517s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2784.918s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I was listening and I just sort of wanted to ask folks or have folks think about a few things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2792.792s">[McLaughlin]</a>: One is, I don't think that this is suggesting that we're taking away discipline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2796.88s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think it's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2797.694s">[McLaughlin]</a>: suggesting that we're taking a closer look at what the disciplinary measures that have been being used are, how effective they've been, and whether or not color has played or race has played a role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2809.501s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think the data shows, I don't think, I know the data shows us that race clearly has played a role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2815.445s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So we were just listening to a student speaking the other day talking about wearing headphones in the hallway at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2824.822s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And she, and this wasn't recent, so I don't want anybody to think that this was them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2830.051s">[McLaughlin]</a>: but she talked about walking in the hallway and she's a black woman student and being yelled at and disciplined for having her headphones on in the hallway as a white student was walking by her doing the exact same thing and did not get yelled at, did not get disciplined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2847.023s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And that is part of the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2848.364s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And that is where the implicit bias comes in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2850.265s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think that people don't realize that we don't realize that we are built with this implicit bias because we are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2857.861s">[McLaughlin]</a>: part of a system that we were brought up in and have been part of our entire lives where we see things as threats related to color, unfortunately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2867.328s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And we see them as more threatening when they're related to color.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2869.65s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And that's why we see disproportionality and discipline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2871.932s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I mean, disproportionality and discipline is a national issue in the United States.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2876.335s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's not something that's specific to Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2878.397s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's a national issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2879.938s">[McLaughlin]</a>: People of color are disproportionately disciplined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2884.311s">[McLaughlin]</a>: in our schools and that, I think, is what Member Ruseau is trying to address in this subcommittee and in this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2890.174s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And that's what I would like us to really take a look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2892.775s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And the discussion that we're not hearing right now, I feel like, is, you know, I appreciated what Stacey Shulman was saying as well about, you know, going back and looking at the events and what sort of triggers the suspension.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2904.24s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think that's important, too, to look at the backstories and the data and the information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2907.901s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But the fact still remains that we are still disproportionately disciplining<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2912.822s">[McLaughlin]</a>: students of color and that is regardless of the instances or the you know what happened or whatever that is a direct result of our own bias and you know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2924.016s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I can share sort of one of my own stories, you know, as a mother of a white male student who, you know, in high school, I mean, in middle school, certainly was disciplined, but might have got a phone call home first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2939.183s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And again, as the co-chair of the CPAC and someone who's involved in the schools and someone who has maybe some means and has a relationship with the administration and all those other things, got phone calls home<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2949.338s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Um, from them to address any sort of discipline issues and also, you know, a student on a, on an ed plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2956.3s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Um, so the disability certainly was a factor in this role, but also in this situation, but also got the benefit of a phone call home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2963.962s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Um, when another parent may not have gotten that, um, maybe because they didn't have a relationship or maybe because they weren't white, or maybe because we don't realize that we do those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2972.184s">[McLaughlin]</a>: They're not intentional, but they, we do do them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2975.205s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so we have to pay attention to those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2977.486s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think that's really.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2979.028s">[McLaughlin]</a>: an important piece, and as much as I wish color wasn't a part of this, it clearly is because the data shows us that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2986.602s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4538.168s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4539.089s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Um, member Graham, can you send me those two additions in the chat just for the notes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4542.911s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Um, I got the first one, but not the second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4545.893s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then, um, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4548.214s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then, um, you know, I also just am hoping people recognize the fact that the rules policy and equity subcommittee is a new subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4558.34s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We had not had an equity subcommittee before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4561.902s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Um, we've certainly had rules, um, subcommittee and,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4566.017s">[McLaughlin]</a>: and policy, but equity is a different lens that we're really putting to the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4572.061s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think it's a really important perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4574.123s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so when we're talking about reporting out, who are we reporting out to, you know, on an annual basis of that, you know, if that's sort of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4583.223s">[McLaughlin]</a>: The point is that, you know, I would say to the equity subcommittee specifically, um, to sort of look at this, but also within the administration, of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4591.745s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then I also believe I don't have it in front of me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4595.446s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Um, and I don't know, I believe I saw Joan on the call, uh, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4598.567s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Bowen, but the coordinated program review, which happens every three years, um, and it's happening this year for the district and includes our high needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4607.77s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Uh, uh, some of our high needs population, our English learners and our, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4612.082s">[McLaughlin]</a>: students with disabilities has an element of discipline in the CPR program review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4618.564s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So that's an important piece to also look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4620.945s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And that will be coming starting this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4624.326s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I think they report out in the spring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4627.087s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So that might be an interesting opportunity for a look at data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4630.208s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But Joan, if you're still here, can you address the section on CPR around discipline?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4701.975s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4703.916s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And is it also an opportunity in that I know that they speak directly with CPAC, but there's also opportunities for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4710.506s">[McLaughlin]</a>: families to reach out to DESE as part of their, they're not calling it a Coordinated Program Review anymore?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4716.429s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Oh, no, they just want to- No, they changed it, so it's just peer-focused monitoring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4719.811s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Peer-focused monitoring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4721.652s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Oh, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4722.232s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So TFM now, not CPR.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4725.374s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4727.655s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But I find it to be a very valuable source of data for folks that are on the call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4734.839s">[McLaughlin]</a>: You can look at the last one, which was three years ago, right, Joan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4739.551s">[McLaughlin]</a>: You can look at the last one that was three years ago to really get a sense of what the data is in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4743.575s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And it's very, very interesting data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4746.438s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And additionally, as DESE is doing the tiered focused monitoring research, community members and administrators and, you know, staff and school committee members and whoever can reach out to them and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4762.301s">[McLaughlin]</a>: give them information or ask them questions or ask them to include information in the report and review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4768.102s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And it's really helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4768.962s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I know that they definitely reach out to the CPAC.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4772.803s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think they have some other requirements about who else they reach out to specifically in the community, but anybody can reach out to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4779.024s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I think that's a really important piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4781.564s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5734.183s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5735.063s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member Ruseau, I just wanted to mention, I'm not sure, I think you responded earlier, but wanted to make sure you didn't forget the comment in the chat regarding a suspension example during remote learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5750.448s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6152.893s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I make a motion to approve the amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6156.375s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6162.678s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Oh, OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6166.799s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6167.74s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6169.546s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I will call myself Melanie McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6171.287s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6172.908s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member Ruseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6215.658s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I would second both sentiments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6217.419s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Congratulations, everyone, for tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6219.559s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We're thinking of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=149.72s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member Ruseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=162.217s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Mayor Longo Karn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3411.667s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3413.389s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Murphy and everyone else for putting all this work together, much appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3419.554s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Regarding the special education outside costs, circuit breaker and external funding that offsets the money that we were talking about, when does that get sort of backed out so that we can see what those numbers actually are?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3432.165s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And where does the money go that was allocated towards special education?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3540.569s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3541.65s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So is there a reconciliation process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3544.031s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So is there a process at which point we see what there actually was an IDEA funding and what there actually was in Circuit Breaker and sort of how that was applied and what the reconciliation of those numbers are?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3609.383s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, I think a reconciliation process would be great to be able to understand where that money actually goes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3614.567s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then I'm assuming one-to-one aids for individuals with IEPs are under the paraprofessional allocation for special education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3624.253s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Is that right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3731.539s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Okay, and, you know, our concern is obviously that we're not taking when you're saying building based professionals that, you know, I know that historically what's been happening and I don't know if it's because of the allocation of substitutes or the difficulty in getting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3745.31s">[McLaughlin]</a>: substitutes that, you know, at least anecdotally, we're hearing that paraprofessionals are being used for substitute positions within the schools, and then, you know, being taken out of specialized programming, which obviously is problematic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3760.764s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so I wanna, two questions about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3762.905s">[McLaughlin]</a>: One is instructional tutor paraprofessionals versus the other paraprofessional.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3769.451s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I know that there's a pay rate difference, but I'm wondering what the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3772.754s">[McLaughlin]</a>: qualification differences on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3774.515s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And maybe that's a question for Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3775.716s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Bowen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3855.417s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3856.498s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3857.179s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And obviously, you know, I appreciate that, Mr. Murphy, and I just want to also clarify, and I know that you, you know, intended this and mean well by this, but for folks that are watching, all students are entitled to the least restrictive environment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3868.011s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I know you know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3873.277s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3873.977s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then for the, I know that we had had trouble historically with, you know, acquiring, I believe substitutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3879.961s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I see that the budget has gone down about $11,000 in the substitute budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3884.825s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I was wondering why are we going down in that line item?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3888.628s">[McLaughlin]</a>: If it's been, you know, difficult historically to get substitutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3919.735s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Actually, it's a higher number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3920.875s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Sorry, Mr. Murphy, you're right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3923.056s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's a higher number for FY22.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3924.536s">[McLaughlin]</a>: That is exactly what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3926.177s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3926.737s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I was looking at it wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3928.706s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3930.147s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Um and I think that's it for my question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3933.688s">[McLaughlin]</a>: What do you say?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3936.47s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Well, you did very well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3937.89s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It was a good guess with all these pages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3940.071s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3940.891s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I will, um, yield to my colleagues for now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3943.252s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=4666.305s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=4667.066s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I want to thank Miss broker for bringing this topic up and I'm wondering, I know that this is complicated and that we have to do some homework on this but this is definitely something that has been an ongoing discussion for years and is definitely something that's a priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=4682.445s">[McLaughlin]</a>: and something that I'm very concerned with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=4684.026s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I'm wondering if we could have a June 14th deadline of what we are actually doing, what those numbers are, and we make a final decision to that end, because we do need to know for the upcoming school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=4697.673s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And this has, I do feel like we keep kicking this can down the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=4808.178s">[McLaughlin]</a>: May I, Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=4811.484s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you, and I appreciate that, and I can appreciate that the time that it takes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=4814.587s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I guess what I'm asking then is, can you give us a time frame, either Mr. Murphy or the superintendent, so that the community and Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=4822.313s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Rocha can know when we will have answers to these questions and some data?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=4826.757s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So if it's not June 14th, is it July 14th?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=4830.18s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Or when can we expect that we could have this information that's a reasonable time frame for you guys?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5027.405s">[McLaughlin]</a>: When?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=85.328s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Mayor Langer-Kern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=674.098s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We met today about summer school and it was really hard to say anything, but we did it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=679.24s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I did write down, and I'll be brief, but I have to, Tony.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=683.743s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you, Superintendent and Dave and the administration for including me in this, because I'm really happy to recognize your leadership, your hard work, your dedication to the staff and students of Medford School Department on the occasion of your well earned retirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=699.714s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Six years ago, we became colleagues in protecting the health and well-being of the Medford Schools community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=706.135s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Whether it was meeting as part of the School Health Advisory Committee, implementing youth risk behavior surveys, tackling behavioral and mental health issues facing our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=715.782s">[McLaughlin]</a>: You remember all the work on the vaping public health crisis?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=719.464s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We thought that was challenging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=723.207s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Then along came COVID.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=725.648s">[McLaughlin]</a>: You immediately went from being my colleague to being my partner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=729.911s">[McLaughlin]</a>: You jumped in with contact tracing and offered your staff to assist from day one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=735.939s">[McLaughlin]</a>: metric meetings, reopening plans to testing, we quickly became attached to the hip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=742.423s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Your leadership, your support, your counsel on tough positions will never be forgotten.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=748.467s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Most of all, the numerous early morning meetings and late night phone calls where often I just needed a friend to vent to and you were always there and my partner became my friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=763.938s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I can't thank you enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=768.021s">[McLaughlin]</a>: When I was wavering, you always reeled me in and you stuck with the science and the data and the facts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=776.947s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So in closing now, I just wanna mention something that sticks out in my mind still.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=783.571s">[McLaughlin]</a>: On one of many ridiculously early Saturday morning calls regarding testing results, I remember calling you while I was still in my pajamas, looking at the results coming in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=793.898s">[McLaughlin]</a>: You picked up the phone and said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=795.643s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Let me call you back in two minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=797.123s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm just checking out at the grocery store.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=803.185s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I remember thinking, wow, she is amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=807.526s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=809.146s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Enjoy your retirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=810.587s">[McLaughlin]</a>: You'll be great in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=811.767s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1282.281s">[McLaughlin]</a>: personally because you were so gracious taking care of our little girl when she had to have a body cast in a wheelchair for two months and you and your staff with her open wounds and everything else, you just made us feel confident handing her over to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1294.249s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And we know that you make every family feel that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1296.23s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And that has been really special.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1297.371s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4433.086s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I want to thank the members of the Columbus Renaming Committee for the excellent presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4438.15s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Three fascinating and incredibly wonderful choices, and it's a great position to be in to be able to have three choices to choose from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4446.837s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I did want to note that the beginning of the presentation, I believe it says that the vote to rename the Columbus School was six to one, and if I'm not mistaking, I think it was unanimous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4457.999s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It was not it was six to one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12146.33s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12147.271s">[McLaughlin]</a>: First, I want to thank the committee for all their hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12149.233s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I know that was a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12150.954s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I watched several of the meetings as well, and I know that it's been a rough year for everyone in multiple ways, for sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12158.8s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I'm going to speak my heart like I always do, and I'm going to speak my values.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12164.073s">[McLaughlin]</a>: First, I want to say, I wish I had known your sister.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12167.275s">[McLaughlin]</a>: She sounds quite remarkable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12169.396s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I want to thank you for being here tonight because I know that that wasn't easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12172.677s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I also watched her husband at the city council meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12177.98s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It was very powerful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12178.961s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12181.462s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12182.282s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12183.643s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And it was really good to hear you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12187.105s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And she does sound quite remarkable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12188.866s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think that the division in the community has been really something to watch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12193.672s">[McLaughlin]</a>: especially as a first time school committee member and also, you know, deliberating in my own mind and debating at night and staying up at night over a lot of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12203.234s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think the one thing that will sort of stay with me tonight more than anything else was the individual who mentioned that we had neglected the children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12216.777s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I felt really, I took that to heart and I have to share with you guys, you know, and I sometimes overshare, I guess,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12223.195s">[McLaughlin]</a>: whatever, but I was a neglected child.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12225.596s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I was awarded the state and I know what it means to be a neglected child.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12229.877s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I have not neglected the children of this school district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12233.198s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I have worked really hard for the children in this community and especially the marginalized children in this community having been a marginalized child.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12241.28s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I will continue to do that whether I'm on the school committee or not, I can promise you all that I will do that because that's just my nature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12247.302s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I wanna say that I know we all feel passionate about things here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12253.342s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I really, really, really hope that we can come together as a community because Medford is an amazing community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12259.084s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I am so fortunate to live here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12260.845s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I have raised my children here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12261.925s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I've been here 24 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12263.245s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I have three kids who are lifelong Medford residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12267.587s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I'm proud to be here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12269.067s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And this is my community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12270.328s">[McLaughlin]</a>: This is my city too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12271.408s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I do have to see you all tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12273.469s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12275.47s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I wanna share with you for my reasons and for the things that have kept me up at night and for all of the things that I'm sharing with you now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12283.324s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm going with the children and I will be voting Mr. Tuck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12287.525s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I wanna thank you all for being here tonight and thank you for listening to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15614.439s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15615.982s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, I was just going to try to clarify, because I was having some questions similar to Democrats during the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15623.184s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think we really just wanted to differentiate having been on the other side of the podium and having done presentations and also having participated in the three-minute sort of thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15633.886s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think people don't realize for the presentation, you submit that a week ahead to the superintendent so that everyone gets them in their packet, what have you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15644.028s">[McLaughlin]</a>: three minute you can come up on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15646.87s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And as Member Ruseau was saying, you may recall last week at the end of the meeting when the gentleman was upset because he felt like he didn't have the opportunity to speak, we just felt like it wasn't really clear to that person when the opportunity was available for them to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15665.16s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So this is really, again, delineating public comment versus public presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15760.535s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16867.013s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I was assuming that we were gonna be able to have this final report because we had a meeting last month that we had expected to have, but was rescheduled due to a family emergency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16878.877s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So we are actually scheduled to have our final meeting this Thursday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16883.519s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So this is not exactly a final report, but I'll just give you folks an update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16887.16s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think you know that we've been working on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16890.404s">[McLaughlin]</a>: From a behavioral health perspective, we've been working on trauma-informed schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16894.727s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Stacey Shulman and several members of the community have been regularly attending these nine meetings over the course of the past 10 months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16903.572s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And one of the recommendations that the subcommittee had was having annual training on mental health needs slash issues that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16917.2s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Stacey can be more specific about, but regular two-hour training around suicide prevention, among other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16925.185s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then the special education portion of it, we've been working on building friendships and community for students with and without disabilities and a disability awareness curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16938.213s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So regarding the building friendships and community,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16942.355s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We've looked at a number of options and we are talking about expanding a high school program and the staff there are looking at how to work with the middle school to extend the program, which is currently a reverse inclusion model where general education students are going into<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16962.711s">[McLaughlin]</a>: for example, access classrooms, but having that as part of a class, as a curriculum, as opposed to every now and then occasion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16973.0s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then a disability awareness curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16975.702s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So they're piloting a disability awareness curriculum with Susanna Campbell, and we're hoping to expand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16983.329s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So those are the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16984.79s">[McLaughlin]</a>: recommendations at this point and as I said we have one more meeting for the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16989.273s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So that's the not quite a report but maybe something more of an update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17001.159s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17002.42s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19562.906s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I was just wondering about how we're, I want to ensure that we're addressing the heat issue around the ESY program that will be housed at the Medford High School over this summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19577.018s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I realize that this resolution is not until the fall, but it does beg the question of how we're addressing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19582.102s">[McLaughlin]</a>: for our most vulnerable students who will be in the high school over these hot summer months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5761.886s">[McLaughlin]</a>: What's the acronym for FERPA, point of information?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6850.797s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6851.718s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I want to thank the students for coming up tonight and speaking as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6855.241s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think to other members' points, if you're<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6859.42s">[McLaughlin]</a>: feel like you're speaking up, but your voice is not heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6862.402s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's a matter of re-victimization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6864.884s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I am so encouraged, though, by Dr. Cushion creating the Student Advisory Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6870.549s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I know it was a matter of law, and it's really wonderful that it's actually happening this year, and it's happening at the high school and expanding to the middle school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6878.575s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's critical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6879.936s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I was able to sit in on one of those sessions with a few of the student advisory folks, and I thought it was really revelatory in terms of what they were telling<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6890.503s">[McLaughlin]</a>: us as an adult and what they were willing to share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6893.064s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I was so really proud of them and this generation, and I have full faith in their generation, much more so than my own, I have to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6900.406s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So keep doing what you're doing, students, and we need to hear from you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6903.488s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We need to know what it is we need to do to make things better here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6907.849s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I also want to encourage folks to ask who's not at the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6911.731s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So when you're having those meetings, you know, I did hear sort of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6915.743s">[McLaughlin]</a>: in the background from some folks that certain students are being asked or you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6921.209s">[McLaughlin]</a>: The same people are coming to the table, and I would say who's not at the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6924.787s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I would encourage the students to ask that question too, who's not at the table, who are we, you know, maybe not including, and how do we think about including them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6931.81s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so I wanna make sure that any of the material that is being sent out, that's been talked about in terms of creating advisory groups, what have you, certainly are translated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6943.476s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I know that Mr. Teixeira was involved with the focus groups, and I know that Joan Bowen and I spoke about doing some, the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6953.52s">[McLaughlin]</a>: special education department doing some social stories for some of the students who need them around how to be involved and how their voice can be heard as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6962.842s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I just want to make sure that we're being inclusive of those voices because I really want to hear and see them see the change that they can make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6971.504s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7299.913s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Madam Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7301.754s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Did we get any emails from the public on this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9160.7s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9162.3s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9162.56s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9162.76s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you for the presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9163.961s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's very detailed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9165.441s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I had a couple of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9168.782s">[McLaughlin]</a>: For the PD on the Massachusetts dyslexia guidelines, I guess, what does that look like?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9176.243s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And is there any information on that offered to families?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9179.643s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I know that there have been concerns from families in the district around this issue, and I'm wondering how they're informed regarding this, or are they?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9190.35s">[McLaughlin]</a>: PD on the mass dyslexia guidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9200.355s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm talking about, Dr. Keyes was talking about offering PD on the mass dyslexia guidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9207.979s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I was just asking how parents are informed on what the dyslexia guidelines are, or are they, and in what instance if a child<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9215.76s">[McLaughlin]</a>: is failing or seems to be failing, what is the process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9218.561s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I know that we're not medical, the school does not offer medical diagnosis and dyslexia is not a medical diagnosis, but in what instance is there understanding of what those dyslexia guidelines are for our families or our students who are struggling?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9234.969s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Is there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9300.471s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think so, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9301.812s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so just, yeah, I'm not, I don't know what the mass dyslexia guidelines are, and I'm just wondering if parents or families or caregivers who have children who are having reading difficulties are aware of those or are made aware of those so that they understand what the school's responsibility is and how to get support for their child if they need it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9471.239s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Okay, so there's not, I'll look at the master's dyslexia guidelines, but I'm assuming there's not a link or anything like that to them on the website or is there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9550.415s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9550.955s">[McLaughlin]</a>: That's what I wanted to follow up with the question for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9553.136s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So for the tier three supports, when a student is identified as tier three in the monitoring system and a tier three support, is that then in the, are those services then in the IEP grid?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9576.058s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And that would be only through an assessment, a reading assessment that they're identified as having a meeting a tier three support?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9605.922s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Right, and so then tier three would be through a reading assessment that they would- It would be through a special education assessment that would be a comprehensive reading assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9613.405s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Okay, and then so they would have a specific reading goal on their IEP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9632.634s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Fascinating, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10212.695s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10213.356s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10214.696s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member Kreatz?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10215.177s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10215.897s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member McLaughlin, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10216.837s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member Mustone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10217.698s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10218.318s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member Ruseau?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10219.699s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member Van der Kloot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10220.559s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10439.086s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I am wondering about, first of all, I guess I wanted to ask the superintendent, her thoughts on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10445.656s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then I had one other follow up question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10447.699s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So if I may, superintendent, what are your thoughts on climate and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10454.895s">[McLaughlin]</a>: culture assessment for the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10676.417s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you for the clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10678.859s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10686.405s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I appreciate the response from my colleague and the superintendent and.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10691.468s">[McLaughlin]</a>: To that end, someone did follow up with me as well that said, and I don't know that this is accurate, I'm sure colleagues here know better than I do, that something similar was, or I don't know if it was similar in terms of cost or proposal, but something similar was created as a result of the McGlynn incident a few years ago, but that it actually was ignored.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10713.877s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Or maybe there was a transition in staff and people were unaware of it or what have you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10718.438s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I think to that end,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10720.259s">[McLaughlin]</a>: First of all, I guess, is that true?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10722.04s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And secondly, to that end, the second to the last paragraph, I think, is really important that we're talking about what the recommendations are and that they're outlining very specific ways to create systemic and structural change and thinking about the implementation of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10738.131s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Because if this has happened in the past and these reviews have been done, but then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10744.468s">[McLaughlin]</a>: have sat and nothing has happened, obviously we don't want that to happen again either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10748.811s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I guess the question is, has this been done in the past and what has happened as a result of those RFPs or reports on climate and culture assessments of schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10758.957s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And how can we make this time different?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10895.789s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Excuse me, just as a point of information, would you send that to us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10898.751s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10899.171s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10899.591s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And also on the amount, what was it for that report?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10955.581s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Oh, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10959.695s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Oh, no, I'm sorry, I'm done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11417.058s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11417.799s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11420.382s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member McLaughlin, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11421.363s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member Mustone, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11422.864s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member Ruseau, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11424.146s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member Van der Kloot, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=5096.323s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=5098.484s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=5099.725s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=5100.145s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=5100.745s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm glad to hear that it's coming for SEL funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=5103.566s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I'm wondering with Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=5105.507s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Bowen here as well, how we're able to support students with significant disabilities in this program?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=5126.856s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm sorry, I didn't hear your last sentence, sorry, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=5128.978s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Baum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=5129.118s">[McLaughlin]</a>: What did you say, several?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=5148.713s">[McLaughlin]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=5220.346s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=5221.767s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=5222.687s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=5223.068s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And can we also ensure that that notification gets out to our out of district?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=5227.209s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=5228.03s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=6233.248s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=6233.908s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you, Mister Murphy for the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=6236.572s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I guess I'm wondering what the proposed process would be, because I think that the motion was that we were gonna start scheduling in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=6246.199s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So if there's a different process as not six COW meetings, for example, what is that process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=6252.864s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And when do we actually think that that's gonna be scheduled?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=6255.026s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Because we were really looking at, if I understood correctly, being able to have some idea of where we were and what we were asking, especially regarding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=6265.573s">[McLaughlin]</a>: hiring practices so that we could be competitive, among other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=6269.118s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But I know that we also have, for example, a motion on the calendar for tonight regarding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=6276.994s">[McLaughlin]</a>: a particular class around summer programming, like, you know, what was the last summer programming?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=6281.436s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Um, how are we, what is the process that you're proposing and when do you propose it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=6550.252s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So, yeah, I guess,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=6553.45s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We need to have, I would recommend a motion for a committee of the whole meeting to discuss what the project process is going to be since we can't really talk out of school committee meetings with each other about what that looks like beyond three of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=6566.633s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I don't know how we move this forward without having a further discussion about what this actually looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=6574.816s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I guess I would recommend making a motion for a committee of the whole to discuss what the budget process will actually be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=6581.238s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So that we do have a better understanding of the process and the schedule for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=7518.042s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=7519.537s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, I definitely hear what folks are saying about the six meetings at several hours each.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=7526.864s">[McLaughlin]</a>: One of the things that I did find interesting in those meetings was it is an edification process for community and I'm wondering how we can address transparency in the budget for the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=7538.241s">[McLaughlin]</a>: around this and then also just a process question because I don't remember, I don't have the minutes and maybe Susie can refer, but did we vote in, didn't we vote in January, early January that we would have a process or a schedule outlined and pass that motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=7556.106s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I don't know if that means we have to have a motion to bypass that motion or what for the process question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=7563.908s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Two things, how can we address transparency in the budget for the community, specifically if we are individually sending you what we're saying our priorities are?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=7571.611s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm wondering how community members know what we're saying our priorities are, among other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=7577.053s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But also sort of just the whole process for me when I would go to budget meetings before I was on the school committee, and I actually learned a lot when I would go to the budget meetings for the COW.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=7584.976s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I know if you're probably going to them,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=7587.017s">[McLaughlin]</a>: you know, multiple times over several years, they get very repetitive, but not everybody in our community is doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=7593.54s">[McLaughlin]</a>: There's a lot of new people in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=7595.221s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so I just, how do we address the transparency and then the process question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8346.431s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8347.732s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Did we get a copy of that in our pocket?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8349.153s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I didn't see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8350.134s">[McLaughlin]</a>: If not, can we get it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8353.696s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And the deck that you did earlier?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8360.079s">[McLaughlin]</a>: If we can get those to that, it'd be really helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8363.941s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Sorry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8368.217s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So, and how many of the, I'm sorry, can you put that graphic back up again, please, Peter?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8382.223s">[McLaughlin]</a>: How many of the, I know it was 17 EL, 32 students with disability, and then it was 60 something ED you had, which I'm assuming is just- Economically disadvantaged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8393.527s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It is the economically disadvantaged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8395.316s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So out of all of, so that's the total, is that the total student data?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8399.238s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Is that the total that's attending summer school or are there any that fall outside of the high needs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8411.602s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Do you know how many students don't?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8414.223s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So of those, what was it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8416.084s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8416.864s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So 96 students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8418.545s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8421.226s">[McLaughlin]</a>: 21 and none of those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8422.386s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8440.616s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, that's what I want to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8441.456s">[McLaughlin]</a>: What are the total number of students that are attending and what are the most vulnerable subgroups so that we can get some idea of where revenue is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8449.106s">[McLaughlin]</a>: is or is not generated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8486.917s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8498.062s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Okay, so I thank you, and I would love the number of just the total, when you get a chance, it doesn't have to be tonight, but when you get a chance, it would be really helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8509.887s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Total number of students enrolled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8511.468s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Is that what you said?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8515.23s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8517.551s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It was 96 students with a total of 160 enrollments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8533.366s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then I am willing to make an amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8535.648s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I just want to clarify for the 45 day, it was really, it's not about necessarily the period of time more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8542.193s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It was more about hearing from constituents who were not, or were saying that they were not really getting notification or understanding that their child was going to be requiring summer school, particularly for retention, not as much for, you know, remediation perhaps, but specifically for retention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8559.634s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I want to know, or I would amend it to whatever the superintendent thinks is reasonable for students and families to be notified of the need for summer school due to retention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8628.208s">[McLaughlin]</a>: processes created, you know, or outlined on what that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8771.26s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So the motion's on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8773.561s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Just needs a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8775.921s">[McLaughlin]</a>: The motion is that we, hold on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8794.687s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, it's on page three of the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8800.407s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Sorry, I just, I'm sorry, I can't hear you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8803.769s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Oh, it's on page three of the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8806.43s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So, and I'm making an amendment to remove the 45 days before the last day of school for the credit remediation to prevent retention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8814.795s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But I would add that a policy will be created to define outreach for retention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8825.861s">[McLaughlin]</a>: That's, you know, communicated to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8830.565s">[McLaughlin]</a>: into the school committee so that we know what that is ahead of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8833.427s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So that, cause what part of the problem was that we were hearing, I was hearing from constituents that they were not getting this communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8841.471s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I know that each side may beg to differ, but it's still, you know, if, if people are saying they don't feel communicated with and others are saying they're communicating, there's clearly, you know, something that needs to be fixed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8854.317s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think it could be around,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8856.02s">[McLaughlin]</a>: just a policy or something that is posted and lets folks know and lets us know what the process is to let families know a student may be retained and require summer school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9344.561s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Sorry, it was be it resolved, Metro Public Schools will no longer charge students identified as belonging to the subgroups economically disadvantaged English learners and students with disabilities for mediation program and credit recovery during summer programming in the academic year commencing June 1, 2022.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9360.69s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Be it further resolved, and this is where I'm saying that I would,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9365.513s">[McLaughlin]</a>: do an amendment if member Mustone is in agreement and obviously the rest of the committee, be it further resolved that a policy will be created for a communication policy will be created for notifying families and students of the requirement for credit or credit remediation, credit recovery or remediation without a date attached to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9389.652s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I mean, without a specific number of days attached to it, but obviously before the end of the academic year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9678.07s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Point of order, Member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9681.171s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Right, so just, I believe we had already approved number two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9686.792s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I thought we motioned and approved and all said aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9691.178s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then didn't we motion to approve it to you, sure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9693.959s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9694.28s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I have to look back at the recording because I swore we did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9711.068s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9712.261s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member Graham made a motion to approve and I'll second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9859.903s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I was going to say, point of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9861.624s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I mean, I would recommend tabling this to clarify on it because I believe that we did say that we would not read the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9873.13s">[McLaughlin]</a>: There was a certain qualification of how we would read the emails based on what the summarization or content of them was, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9881.874s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So, but instead of trying to at 9.30<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9887.7s">[McLaughlin]</a>: pull apart what we did and didn't do, since we don't have the reference to that with us now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9892.103s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Do we, do we have it in the minutes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9894.124s">[McLaughlin]</a>: You have it right there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9896.025s">[McLaughlin]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10145.264s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So, point of information, Member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10149.869s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think part of the issue is that nobody has a policy manual, and that was one of the things that I wanted to sort of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10157.14s">[McLaughlin]</a>: ask about and bring up is that there's a policy manual that's on the website that a lot of which was adopted by the MASC, some of which has been changed by the school committee, this body, after recommendations by the rules policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10172.83s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Rules subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10174.552s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I think part of the problem is that we're looking at new policy compared to, or we're not looking at compared to old policy because none of us has a policy manual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10186.502s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I know that in a moment, we're going to be talking about a number of proposed rules, but I think that this is just, is part of the confusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10195.27s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I would also just add, if I may,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10198.19s">[McLaughlin]</a>: that just to be clear for residents that are listening or will listen later, that there are a number of ways obviously to contact us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10206.092s">[McLaughlin]</a>: One is through this group email.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10209.193s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Also another is individually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10210.733s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And yes, we may or may not bring those things forward as questions in the school committee, but you can also obviously ask your school committee member or anybody within the school committee, the mayor, whoever, if they would consider putting something on the agenda that is of importance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10227.598s">[McLaughlin]</a>: that they feel is of importance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10228.838s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's not just a matter of you can only email us, that they also, you know, can ask if we would consider putting something on the agenda or requesting that something's put on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10237.54s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Does not mean that it will be, that it may not be, but there are a number of ways to sort of move policy or policy requests forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10246.663s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I want to make sure that folks understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10248.843s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I don't think that that necessarily has to be written into this piece, but I just wanted to say that out loud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10254.845s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I would suggest that we,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10257.104s">[McLaughlin]</a>: get a policy manual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10258.325s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think reading it on the website has been really cumbersome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10260.785s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And it's also the BEDH and the BEDA and the BED, it's just sort of like, I don't even think people know what the acronym stands for, which is more just a numbering system that I think MASC created.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10572.246s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I would just like to make a point of information, though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10574.867s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I know, and I do, it's a tremendous amount of work, and I can see that through the Chair to Member Ruseau, and I think it does bear more thought and more time, and I know myself, you know, this came<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10587.721s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I received it on Thursday in a packet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10589.723s">[McLaughlin]</a>: My two children went away to college this weekend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10592.646s">[McLaughlin]</a>: My littlest one had, you know, a significant doctor's appointment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10597.45s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I did not really get to give this the attention that I would like to and do some comparison to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10602.853s">[McLaughlin]</a>: the policy that is posted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10604.234s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So while I guess I'm not understanding, and maybe member Ruseau can clarify when you say that there's been no, have traditionally, the rules of the school committee have traditionally been passed down through the experience of members, but there are rules and policy listed on the website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10622.521s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I don't know, I'm not sure through the chair, I'm not sure why, I know that they need to be changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10628.304s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I couldn't agree more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10629.084s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I would actually suggest that this,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10631.456s">[McLaughlin]</a>: be moved to the Rules Subcommittee so that we can actually really vet it and go through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10635.939s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I can see why you would say Committee of the Whole, but I think that that's why we have the Rules Subcommittee too, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10658.405s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Well, I think, point of information, if I may, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10661.426s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member McLaughlin, point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10663.827s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think it gives people the opportunity, two things, it does two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10667.968s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It gives people the opportunity to review the document and have some time to review the document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10672.309s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10680.312s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then it has,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10681.98s">[McLaughlin]</a>: the opportunity for the rules subcommittee to go through and make sure that things have been covered for all our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10690.204s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10756.91s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I would remove that motion, and I would agree, if I may, with the Committee of the Whole, I would remove the motion, Mayor, for the referral to the Rural Subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10766.355s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But we're talking about a multi-year effort,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10770.762s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I guess I would say by whom, and it sounds like it was by Member Ruseau, which I think is, you know, valiant, but also it's a seven-member body and we really need time to digest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10784.827s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I'm sorry if, you know, the busyness of our lives has not provided in the two weeks to read the 18-page rule document, but I also wanna compare it to the previous policy, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10889.912s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10892.514s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'd like to, Mayor, may I?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10894.435s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10895.676s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'd like to request, I don't think it needs to be in a form of a motion, but if it does, I can, but is there a way that we can get hard copies of the current policy that's posted on the website?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10910.076s">[McLaughlin]</a>: What information member Ruseau?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10913.457s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10913.817s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I'm asking if one could be created.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10915.678s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's cut and paste of what's on there and put it into a document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10941.816s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Right, which I think is more reason that we need to have a printout of the policies that we currently have up on the website for what we have to compare them against the rules, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10990.258s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Mayor, may I?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10992.119s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10993.6s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I would be willing to volunteer to take the document to a copy store and have copies made for the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11029.784s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Can you hear me now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11031.565s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Can you hear me now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11034.948s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, so I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11036.889s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Because it's so cumbersome and there are 18 pages here, and then like as Member Ruseau was saying, there's so many on the policy, and these are rules that reflect policy and policy that reflects rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11048.498s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think we do need to do a comparison.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11051.0s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I don't think we're going to have, in a committee of the whole, the ability to do that, you know, with our computers and, you know, what have you, in this hard document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11059.829s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11061.551s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Call me old-fashioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11062.352s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I guess I work well with the papers beside each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11065.875s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But if no one else wants a copy, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11067.597s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I can make a copy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11442.94s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So just to be clear, it's eliminating antiquated policy, and it's not that a smaller number can't meet, which obviously a smaller number can meet as long as we don't constitute a quorum if we want to have coffee together or something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11459.905s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And we're not talking about school committee business, but we can't adjourn because it's not a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11743.076s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think, did Member Creutz, were you before me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11745.358s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11746.755s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member Kreatz, do you have a question as well?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11748.436s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Oh, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11749.736s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Oh, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11750.357s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11752.478s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think this is great and it's sorely needed for sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11757.2s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I just have some questions on some of the comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11761.062s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And one is that I'm curious about on the bottom of page six, where it's approximate number of non-IEP referrals that are on a wait list for school-based counseling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11770.527s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm wondering what the differentiation is there, if you can explain that a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11800.611s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11802.946s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then I just, again, a process question, and I know, again, through the Chair, that Member Hays may not have, well, may not have been at the meeting, certainly, when the process was, or the policy was created around requesting reports from administration, and I just wanted to know if that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11824.552s">[McLaughlin]</a>: was a process that need to be followed as we're talking about what the, I think this is needed, don't get me wrong, but just what the demands are on the staff and the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11834.522s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I thought there was a whole process of vetting that we were going through for requesting reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11879.433s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm fine with taking a vote for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11885.678s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm not sure that that's what the policy is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11887.94s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And again, if we're being stickless for policy, I just want to make sure that we're following it just because I don't want to have some people follow and other people not, and obviously in the interest of fairness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11897.868s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11898.588s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I thought, I think you're right that I'm happy to vote on this tonight and,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11903.865s">[McLaughlin]</a>: the superintendent and the administrative team can come back on a time that's reasonable to get the report to us, if that's amenable to the members who are offering this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11915.175s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I guess I would just have us make sure that we're checking the policy as a group so that we know what the process actually is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11923.682s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11925.884s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member Ruseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12343.437s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I know that this has been sort of, especially the last portion of this resolution was a sore point in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12355.325s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I want to know if there's going to be some clarification around how we are building the flagship committee with, I know it says comprised of representative stakeholders, and I want to know how that's being defined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12372.717s">[McLaughlin]</a>: and how we're going to ensure that members of the community feel included in the process, because I know that that was a real issue last time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12382.641s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I'm wondering if someone could speak to that a little bit, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12440.337s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12440.637s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I guess, so are we, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12443.719s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So we can have a conversation about that in the committee of the whole, but there's nothing in the policy that discusses or mentions how the advisory committees are built in terms of, I mean, I just, correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12454.525s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12454.905s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Cause I'm seeing our seven, our demographic of our seven members and it's concerning and I want to make sure that we're being really thoughtful about how we are creating the rules around how the advisory committee is built.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12467.832s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=333.172s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Mayor, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=334.493s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=335.754s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you, Dr. Edwards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=337.79s">[McLaughlin]</a>: What time is the CCSR event?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1602.346s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1603.626s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I just wanted to note that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1606.257s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Well, this is a difficult topic for many, and folks that are speaking now, we've gotten the same in emails from both folks who want to stay masked longer than lot 14, and folks who want to unmask, and numerous emails.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1625.281s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I do wanna say that we are all parents here as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1629.722s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And we all care about our children and we all care about your children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1633.343s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I would rather err on the side of caution for two more weeks after a vacation, when children have been finally together in public settings across the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1644.447s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Additionally, you know, when people are talking about science and what science, I know that 941,044 people<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1654.33s">[McLaughlin]</a>: died in the United States of America in the past two years due to COVID-19.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1659.514s">[McLaughlin]</a>: That's the data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1660.755s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Is it worth one child?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1663.055s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Really, I don't understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1664.436s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I get that we're all heated about this and that this is a political cause, but for many, but I want to defer to the superintendent and say, I thought that this was actually a happy medium, if you will, between the two opposing sides that we are hearing so much from that will err on the side of caution after a vacation, when the children were all together publicly, finally, we were able to socialize with each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1687.706s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Some without masks, some with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1689.727s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I definitely have a student that is high needs and vulnerable, but also all the other families that I know that have high needs and vulnerable who are very much scared, and people can say what they want about that but it's legitimate and it's real and I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1705.542s">[McLaughlin]</a>: You know, the superintendent and the central administration have been working and the nursing staff and the teachers and everybody has been working so hard these past two years that when are we going to finally like join together and be like, we're almost on the way out of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1721.568s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We're a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1722.849s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Let's get past this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1723.849s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Let's start to socialize with each other and stop fighting and start focusing on what's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1728.651s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And that's the children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=1730.452s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3557.448s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3558.786s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you, this is a great opportunity, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3560.387s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Glucy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3561.048s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Excited about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3562.128s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And when you said 12 to 15 students, I'm assuming you mean by school for the group size, or what did you mean by that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3577.399s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3581.262s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Great, so like a small group instruction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3582.943s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3583.223s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3584.468s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I am assuming that obviously this is available to children with IEPs and English learners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3590.171s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3590.731s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3590.951s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3591.311s">[McLaughlin]</a>: This is really exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3916.35s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Mayor, I just have one more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3918.312s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3919.432s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3920.753s">[McLaughlin]</a>: When you get the data back for the review that you'll share with the school committee once again, can we just get some indication of if it's not exposing children, for example, their privacy, some data of the collective, how many children with IEPs and how many English learners are in the category.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3943.531s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So disaggregated data by demographic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4626.467s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4629.15s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Can we get an update on how many people did enroll and how?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4632.554s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4633.035s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6134.696s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Can we go to the questions there before?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6137.858s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member McLaughlin?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6139.678s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I just wanted to know if we could go through the questions before moving to promotions, because there's definitely, I mean, I think this is, thank you for this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6146.441s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think there's a lot of really exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6147.982s">[McLaughlin]</a>: One second, is that okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6149.082s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, I mean, I don't have a second anyways, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6153.845s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6155.185s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, I think this is really great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6156.626s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm excited about Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6158.787s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Fidler-Carey being in this role and,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6162.189s">[McLaughlin]</a>: having recently been on a family and community engagement training with her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6166.634s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm excited about the opportunities that are here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6168.636s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I guess I'm really interested in the paraprofessional piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6173.961s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think that obviously accessibility for students on IEPs and English learners is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6180.124s">[McLaughlin]</a>: is and has been a concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6181.305s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I know there was an anti-discrimination clause that was created, I believe last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6186.827s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I just wanted to ask if in the anti-discrimination clause, there's also a statement that says, if you need additional services or supports to let us know, because I know that's what Medford REC sort of is doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6197.112s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And we need some consistency, I guess, around some of those just to make sure that we're getting those, but getting back to the voucher program, I guess my thoughts on this are a couple of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6210.405s">[McLaughlin]</a>: how many families are aware of the voucher program, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6213.569s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I know that the EEC is offering the voucher program, but do we as a community have a responsibility to make sure that families know about this voucher program, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6223.883s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And how they access the voucher program, particularly when we're talking about grandfathering in people, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6228.947s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I would be really reluctant to vote yes on, you know, ending this right now and having the current folks grandfathered in because I want to give people the opportunity to be grandfathered in and get these vouchers through perhaps some, you know, outreach or education to families about the availability of the vouchers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6247.834s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I guess also because we don't have a clear delineation on what the hardship application that's going to be developed looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6255.431s">[McLaughlin]</a>: it's all kind of ambiguous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6256.672s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I know that the intent here is, is really on point in terms of let's get rid of the bureaucracy and the paperwork and make sure that we're getting access to our students and really being there for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6268.319s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But in reality, at the same time, the EEC voucher, you know, is created for some reason to be able to get families, you know, access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6276.384s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So if we can create a comparable sort of system without the bureaucracy, obviously,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6281.452s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think that that's great, but we haven't yet, and so how do we how do we sort of make that bridge, I guess, is what I'm saying, so I want us to really be thoughtful before just just moving ahead, because I obviously don't want to and I know you don't want to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6295.994s">[McLaughlin]</a>: exclude folks who are economically disadvantaged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6298.856s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think it is a real disappointment that so many of these families qualify, but they're not actually using the budget program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6305.201s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And knowing one of the directors at the EEC, I think, you know, she would be horrified to know that that's really what's happening on the ground level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6312.206s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I'm sure that the data bears that out for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6314.848s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So they see that in some way, as we know, with the SNAP gap and other things, why aren't people applying?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6319.452s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6320.314s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Um, I guess I would just say, I would like to be a little bit more thoughtful and just sort of moving ahead with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6325.478s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Although I, I, I do appreciate and understand the motive behind it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6329.301s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I would just love to know, you know, and again, what families want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6332.884s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So, you know, whether it's a, the community engagement subcommittee or, or what, I don't know, but you know, what does the hardship application look like?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6339.889s">[McLaughlin]</a>: How will it be developed and implemented with community input so that we're making sure that we're being thoughtful about this, but also really having an outreach program regarding the voucher program so that families know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6350.353s">[McLaughlin]</a>: that they could be grandfathered in for the rest of their child's stay if they're in fact eligible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6356.958s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6467.892s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6468.373s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Mayor, with a follow-up question to that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6473.517s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Chair?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6474.417s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Mayor, may I follow up with a question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6476.519s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes, Member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6477.78s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6479.181s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So, thank you for that response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6483.332s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think that, you know, there's a lot of, you know, what ifs and ands, and I think that I would really like the data to drive the decision, as I know you all do in the long run as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6494.002s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I guess, you know, again, reaching out to the, hopefully the LPAC that's being created, the CPAC, other organizations and entities, MFN, others that can really even have a voucher, you know, workshop program or something like that, that could, you know, help families, I think could be really useful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6510.241s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And there was something else that you had said that I just wanted to follow up on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6513.662s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Oh, that was it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6514.723s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So, and the other question is, and I know you said other districts are doing this and have been doing this through your afterschool network.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6521.505s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So the other question is, what happens if a family comes in with a voucher?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6525.547s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Like, is it legal to say, well, we don't use those vouchers, we're gonna have to do this system through the vouchers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6531.849s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Like, how does that work?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=6584.517s">[McLaughlin]</a>: EEC has some work to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=8040.238s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Oh, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=8040.838s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes, it's on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=8042.198s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=8042.679s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I just feel like you've obviously given a lot of thought to this and there's a lot of comparative data around what other folks are doing and your recommendation for waiting the year with a voucher program, your initial recommendation, I think is important as we think about these families and how they are accessing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=8063.083s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I would ask that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=8064.802s">[McLaughlin]</a>: you know, we go with your recommendation on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=8066.904s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think that you're being very thoughtful in the step-by-step process of it, which I'm encouraged to see, especially with the thinking about and wanting to know more about what the hardship application process will be and what that will look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=8080.199s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And again, sort of the family engagement piece of this, like how are we engaging the community in this conversation to make sure that they're feeling ownership around this too, whether it's, you know, an ability to pay more or whether it's input on what the hardship application process looks like, or whether it's, let's continue the voucher for one more year, because we need to be able to apply and get the word out to folks that you can apply, because what I'm hearing from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=8105.943s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think what I'm hearing from Mr. Murphy is that the risk piece of it around, you know, just our hardship application may be more than with the voucher application because of the reimbursement process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=8119.528s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I think you guys are being really thoughtful about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=8121.848s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I would like to take your recommendation that we wait on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=8173.449s">[McLaughlin]</a>: May we have a roll call vote on that, please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=8175.33s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I don't want to exclude families, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=8177.631s">[McLaughlin]</a>: You don't want to exclude who?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=8178.571s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I said it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=8179.312s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Can we do a roll call vote on that, please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=8181.593s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=8181.873s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=8182.493s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=8270.97s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I approve the pay rate increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=8272.551s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm not for the voucher program decrease because I think we'll exclude families and not give them the opportunity for grandfathering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=8281.018s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I would ask that we split the motion, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=299.636s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=301.257s">[McLaughlin]</a>: That was really helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=302.798s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I don't know if that's what Member Ruseau was thinking of from the macro perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=306.84s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think that's super helpful for the process perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=310.542s">[McLaughlin]</a>: From the macro perspective, what I was thinking about was more specific to the superintendent and to the last year that we've all been through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=318.467s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I just wanted to say it's been four years now that the superintendent's been with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=326.602s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I was actually on the superintendent hiring committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=329.063s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I got to meet Dr. Edouard-Vincent back then during the interviews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=334.305s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So that was interesting to see the process and now being able to work together and collaborate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=339.306s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But I guess I just also want, or, and I guess I just also want to point out that it's been four years that Dr. Evey's been with us and two and a half of those years have been a global pandemic and a racial reckoning in our country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=353.276s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so these have been really trying and very difficult times for everyone, and I want to make sure that we really appreciate that from the, from the start, because in addition to that, I want to point out, as I'm sure we know, but I wonder if the community knows,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=369.831s">[McLaughlin]</a>: that Dr. Edouard-Vincent came in four years ago to a system that had been primarily a patriarchal system, frankly, and had been run for 30 years for the most part by another administrator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=385.342s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So all of that, I mean, imagine coming into any system as a new person taking over a position that had been filled for 30 years<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=394.548s">[McLaughlin]</a>: and run a certain way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=396.57s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And again, during a pandemic and a racial reckoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=400.233s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I would just like to start that macro macro view for the for myself and for the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=405.657s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then I would just welcome my colleagues to sort of offer a macro comment if they have any, just sort of big picture idea of like what this past year encompassed and coming back to school from a pandemic, you know, from remote, those sorts of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=418.767s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So that's all I wanted to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=420.409s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=984.702s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=985.122s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I was just going to ask maybe if we, I want to ask my colleagues, I don't know, do you want to read the performance goals first, and then we can comment if we want to after the performance goals, or did you want to do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=997.223s">[McLaughlin]</a>: one by one in comment, or I'm wondering sort of what, again, back to process, what my colleagues are thinking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1004.707s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm fine with doing the four performance goals and then an opportunity for comments or questions, if that's okay with you, Mayor and colleagues, I don't know, or did people wanna stop on each one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1020.635s">[McLaughlin]</a>: That's what I'm trying to figure out, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1077.185s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, just a point of clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1078.386s">[McLaughlin]</a>: That's not what I'm asking, through the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1081.207s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So that's not what I'm asking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1082.447s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm just asking if we have questions when you want them, or comments when you want them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1087.45s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So if you want to do it after each segment, that's fine, but not on our individual comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1092.592s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1093.053s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1093.413s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, after each segment, after each five, set of five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1201.113s">[McLaughlin]</a>: May I make a suggestion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1204.895s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Also, just, you know, again, so we're not hearing the same, but it also feels more collaborative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1209.556s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Perhaps we could take sections or take turns reading the comments so that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1215.428s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's not just all coming from one member in terms of the comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1219.651s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I just put that out there as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1221.933s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm happy to do some of the reading or if any of the other colleagues want to, but I think that would make it feel a little less monotonous perhaps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1230.82s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I would just make that recommendation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1327.213s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Developing a district wide focus on instruction and assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1330.895s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So the overall score was a 3.69 and comments were would like to see more on differentiated instruction and universal design for learning to include all learners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1343.54s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We could benefit from the expertise of special educators working with general educators to create a library of sorts of differentiated material instruction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1352.064s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Don't feel the learning walks are as inclusive of all communities as they could be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1356.726s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Also wondering how the curriculum frameworks are being met in classrooms like access classrooms and out of district programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1363.109s">[McLaughlin]</a>: The superintendent evaluation primarily mentioned professional development as a means of achieving this goal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1369.232s">[McLaughlin]</a>: However, professional development<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1371.673s">[McLaughlin]</a>: is a short duration activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1373.214s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We need to see data and accountability on how these professional development topics are actually put into practice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1378.657s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Mention of the monthly coherent practice with principals, but not of how those leaders that incorporated that learning into their schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1384.961s">[McLaughlin]</a>: If there's data on this, the school committee would welcome it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1465.187s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Sure, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1468.831s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think that in some of this, it would look like general education collaborating with special education and others, so that I know that there's some levels where there's co-teaching happening in some of the classrooms, but not across the district as a whole substantially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1486.568s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And for example, I know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1488.385s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Susanna Campbell and Joan Bowen had worked collaboratively with other teachers on differentiated programming and creating a library that's available on our website for some lesson planning that's differentiated, but I'm not sure or it's unclear what's been done in terms of PD for universal design for learning and how that's actually being incorporated into the classrooms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1508.86s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then in the learning walk, sort of, you know, looking at<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1511.965s">[McLaughlin]</a>: the curriculum frameworks and how they're being used across the district and also in other districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1517.388s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So for example, we know we have certain curriculum at certain levels, so elementary, middle school, high school sort of curriculums, but is it the same curriculum that is being used in the special education classrooms?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1533.015s">[McLaughlin]</a>: If so, how are they being differentiated?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1535.076s">[McLaughlin]</a>: If not, what is the curriculum and how does the superintendent know what the curriculum is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1539.191s">[McLaughlin]</a>: whether we're having high standards for all children, even children that potentially are taking MCAS ALT and don't affect our data scoring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1551.382s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Personally, I think that that could look like curriculum meetings with special education and looking at as a whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1558.668s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We also have as a responsibility as a district, I understand,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1562.392s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Or I've recently understood that we are required to look at curriculum, particularly for our collaborative, and seeing what our collaborative partnerships are in terms of curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1574.081s">[McLaughlin]</a>: That's part of the school committee's responsibility with DESE, from what I understand, but also the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1579.766s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I guess I would venture to say, can the superintendent say clearly what curriculum, if any, is being used in these other classrooms?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1588.97s">[McLaughlin]</a>: how curriculum is being differentiated for all learners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1592.731s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Again, students with learning differences, but also, you know, students at all different levels, project based learning, what have you, and what that looks like in a variety of programming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1601.494s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So, you know, from the access classroom to the connections to the EL classrooms to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1605.755s">[McLaughlin]</a>: to our out of district programs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1606.975s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Do we know what the curriculum is and how are we sort of trying to make sure that we have high standards for all?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1612.917s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So again, what would that look like?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1614.478s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think it would be, again, learning walks through those environments and also working with your directors in those examples.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1621.44s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So your directors of our collaborative, your directors of our special education, your directors of our EL and looking at how is the curriculum really manifesting across those different strands in terms of really embedding equity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1633.843s">[McLaughlin]</a>: and those in having high expectations for everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=1636.365s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I hope that was helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2184.148s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Mayor, I was going to say, point of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2186.049s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Can we get back to order?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2188.069s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2188.589s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Not anything on any members, but I agree if it's for 42.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2193.24s">[McLaughlin]</a>: and we have to get through the rest of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2195.161s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm happy to read the next one if you like, or if someone else wants to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2197.783s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes, that'd be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2198.683s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2201.465s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2203.866s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So now we're moving on to the superintendent performance on standards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2207.789s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So there are a number of standards with subcategories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2210.47s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So standard one is instructional leadership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2213.332s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And under that, there's a 1.1 curriculum, 1.2 instruction, 1.3 assessment,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2219.454s">[McLaughlin]</a>: evaluation and data informed decision making.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2221.696s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So those items are sort of the subsets of the larger instructional leadership items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2227.921s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So if it's okay, I'll just read standard one with those items and then maybe another colleague can raise their hand for standard two and we can hopefully cruise along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2236.467s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So standard one instructional leadership, the overall score was 3.01.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2239.75s">[McLaughlin]</a>: They were<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2243.482s">[McLaughlin]</a>: three paragraphs of comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2245.364s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Basically, again, wondering if this is happening with special education and programming curriculum out of district placements, whether all students are in a proximal zone of learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2256.217s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Are they getting age appropriate grade level instruction through curriculum throughout, of high standard curriculum throughout our schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2264.183s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Dr. Edouard-Vincent's commitment to improving curriculum and instruction at MPS is clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2268.586s">[McLaughlin]</a>: There's much work to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2269.787s">[McLaughlin]</a>: The work happening at the elementary level is evident across literacy, science, and math.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2274.11s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Commitment to math excellence at all levels is clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2276.712s">[McLaughlin]</a>: There remains opportunity at the secondary level to focus on remediation of students in literacy and math in particular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2284.015s">[McLaughlin]</a>: where elementary experience was not the same as today's standards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2288.196s">[McLaughlin]</a>: There's more action needed to bridge gaps because of the pandemic that existed both before the pandemic and certainly were exacerbated through the pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2297.178s">[McLaughlin]</a>: The K-12 health curriculum needs to be a significant focus in the next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2301.76s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's not implemented consistently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2303.633s">[McLaughlin]</a>: and pandemic-related gaps are not closed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2305.375s">[McLaughlin]</a>: The elementary curriculum is not up to par, and the current curriculum does not adequately reflect focus on all the aspects of health expected from a modern, comprehensive health curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2314.823s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I would also add, if I could just add the ring here a little bit, maybe we can add it in, is that there's nothing for special education in terms of the health curriculum as well, differentiated health curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2324.271s">[McLaughlin]</a>: A focus on instructional leadership needs to branch out from just the core curriculum areas that are covered by MCAS testing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2331.157s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So again, not just focusing on the MCAS testing curriculum levels, but across all instructional levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2337.72s">[McLaughlin]</a>: A health curriculum that's taught by appropriately certified professionals that covers all areas of health, inclusive of sexual and reproductive education needs to be a focus in the coming year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2348.063s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Sexual and gender minorities do not appear to be receiving appropriate health curriculums that is inclusive of their needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2352.685s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And again, I would add the same for disability and perhaps EL, I'm not sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2357.944s">[McLaughlin]</a>: This topic has been brought up many times, but continues to not receive attention it deserves for the health, safety, and happiness of our students, not covered by the heteronormative health curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2366.409s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'll also add DESE just modified their health curriculum frameworks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2370.031s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It was something like from 1999.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2373.212s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So it's something that's a state level issue as well, but definitely needs to be looked at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2379.155s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then under curriculum, the score is 3.07.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2383.078s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So the score for instructional leadership as a whole was 3.01, curriculum was 3.07,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2388.129s">[McLaughlin]</a>: instruction 2.96, assessment 3.11, evaluation 2.94, and then data-informed decision-making 2.97 with a comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2398.555s">[McLaughlin]</a>: This is happening as it's published on the DESE site, et cetera, but growth data, student learning, et cetera, is not something that's shared with school committee or public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2407.139s">[McLaughlin]</a>: The SE and public would appreciate more reporting on our data, even if it's merely included in our meeting packets as informational.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2414.823s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So if someone wants to take standard two,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2425.991s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Can I may or actually can I ask if it's okay for Maurice to ask the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=2431.053s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Because I'm afraid I'll forget as if we move on to the next one so if we could just stay in that at least a subset with all those categories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3151.686s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I was wondering if we can comment on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3155.699s">[McLaughlin]</a>: If I can raise my left one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3157.16s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3158.68s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I just wanted to comment and I'm happy to read the professional culture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3162.642s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Next, but I just wanted to sort of comment on the family engagement piece because I think it's an important one that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3170.583s">[McLaughlin]</a>: sort of was one of the lower scores, needs improvement sort of score.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3175.204s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It was in between the, a little bit more than a two point, it was a 2.66.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3179.045s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So not quite there yet with a three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3182.426s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I just think that that's something that, you know, while we have a new department and, you know, that department's growing and frankly, you know, from member Hays' perspective at the beginning of the meeting as well, there's just been so much that has been done compared to the previous administration around this, just like thinking about,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3199.273s">[McLaughlin]</a>: materials being translated that hadn't before, and a family and community engagement, you know, liaison that we didn't have before, just so many things that have been done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3209.217s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I do want to say that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3210.397s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But I do think that this is a huge area for improvement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3213.318s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And there's lots of opportunity here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3215.099s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And we have so much expertise in the community, both families and community organizations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3221.677s">[McLaughlin]</a>: community organizations where we could really build community-based schools and be able to leverage a lot of the resources that are there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3230.542s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I just sort of wanted to expand on that a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3233.224s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And also just in terms of communication with other more marginalized communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3238.487s">[McLaughlin]</a>: For example, I know that Talking Tools is a software program that I believe<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3245.832s">[McLaughlin]</a>: that Paul, Director Paul Teixeira uses, and that the district has access to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3251.376s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And it was something that I was speaking with him about, even in terms of having the superintendent and school committee members have access to that, talking points, so that we could actually talk to people who are not English speakers in their native language, that we could text with them, and that it could be translated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3266.682s">[McLaughlin]</a>: and vice versa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3267.963s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so I know that they've been using the Talking Points app, and it's been super successful with the EL teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3273.165s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I would say, why could that not be expanded to, again, the superintendent and potentially school committee members, so that we're thinking about how we're engaging our more marginalized communities, because it does seem all too often the emails are from the same people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3286.393s">[McLaughlin]</a>: the same people are at the table, the same people come to the meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3290.135s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I would really like to see that disrupted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3292.956s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'd really like to be able to work collaboratively in figuring out how we can really engage families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3298.439s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So that was just the feedback I wanted to offer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3301.06s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I was wondering if Dr. Edouard-Vincent has anything to say on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3674.044s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Do you guys want me to read the next one and when member Graham comes back on she can comment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3684.66s">[McLaughlin]</a>: or not, ma'am.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3883.728s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Sorry, hold on one second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3886.19s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Make sure I'm having on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3888.992s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Professional culture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3919.248s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Do you want me to reach standard four, Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3921.529s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3924.17s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Standard four, professional culture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3925.61s">[McLaughlin]</a>: This is 2.88 overall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3926.511s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6 subcategories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3935.622s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But interestingly, one, two, three, four of the six subcategories don't have any comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3941.105s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I actually have some questions on them because I wasn't sure from colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3945.927s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But professional culture 2.88, the superintendent should focus on relationships building in order to further her objectives around curriculum and instruction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3955.451s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'd like to see her build strong relationship with teachers and staff and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3959.0s">[McLaughlin]</a>: begin to reverse decades of mistrust and non-collaboration that have been present in MPS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3964.181s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Concern about the climate and culture of high school and would like to see action to address the structural ways our organization hinders progress on achieving a positive climate and culture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3976.123s">[McLaughlin]</a>: The organizational structure is not optimal and needs to be significantly overhauled in order to see alignment with student achievement goals that will close gaps and serve children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3985.267s">[McLaughlin]</a>: School committee is available to collaborate, support, and provide resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3989.349s">[McLaughlin]</a>: This work is difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3990.89s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We'd like to see more effective collaboration with the school committee and other stakeholders to move the strategic vision forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=3997.794s">[McLaughlin]</a>: There's been examples of cultural proficiency issues at various places in the district this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4004.257s">[McLaughlin]</a>: For example, a dress code at the high school that indicate there's more work to do to create the kind of environment that we all wish to see for our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4013.162s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Through her own continued professional development and the many professional development opportunities she's implemented for administrators, teachers, and other staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4020.808s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Dr. Edouard-Vincent demonstrates a strong commitment to continuous learning and high standards in the area of communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4026.292s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Dr. Edouard-Vincent has implemented, continued some valuable systems of communication with families, Friday emails, and staff learning walks and listening tours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4035.302s">[McLaughlin]</a>: While these are a good foundation, there's not enough evidence that they are being consistently and fully utilized as a means to inform and involve these groups in order to advance the work of the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4045.09s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Commitment to high standards 3.37 high standards are only high standards if they're consistently applied work to be done to ensure high standards are universally applied throughout the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4058.117s">[McLaughlin]</a>: The places where our standards need improvement are mostly known and therefore it's the willingness to act on those challenges across the district that appear to be the difficulty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4067.547s">[McLaughlin]</a>: For cultural proficiency 2.87, communications 2.69, continuous learning 2.87,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4077.337s">[McLaughlin]</a>: shared vision 2.84 managing conflict 2.64 perhaps it's the pandemic and the ongoing disagreement and dissent but the superintendent could be more direct and a stronger leader when it comes to this standard managing conflict.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4093.049s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then mayor if I can ask a question on the professional culture or sort of if I could raise my hand if<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4102.362s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4103.783s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4104.844s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So for professional culture sort of as an overall standard, the way I just sort of want to explain the way that I saw the standard for professional culture was more about the again, because we're evaluating the superintendent and not the whole district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4117.494s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It was more about how the district and teachers and staff and others are all interacted in communicating with each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4125.18s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I do think that we have a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4129.764s">[McLaughlin]</a>: some professional culture concerns around, what's the word I'm looking for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4138.947s">[McLaughlin]</a>: sort of a, I guess there's sort of a negative environment right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4141.888s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I don't know if that's an artifact of, you know, sort of whatever this post pandemic phases or pre post pandemic phases or what have you, but we definitely have, you know, a low mood at the schools, if you will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4154.152s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so that's one of the things that I saw this particularly as, and I just want to be really clear around the cultural proficiency piece, which is under the professional cultural<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4164.996s">[McLaughlin]</a>: culture, which was a 2.87.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4166.937s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I just want to just make a point here for me that that is not, in my opinion, what some might view as cultural proficiency as a whole in that professional culture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4180.423s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So in other words, I think Dr. Edouard-Vincent has done a tremendous job bringing diversity to our district in terms of reminding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4189.927s">[McLaughlin]</a>: us all, why diversity is so important in our district, why equity and inclusion is so important in our district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4195.549s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And that cannot be easy for a woman superintendent, who also happens to be a person of color, coming into a district that's been very traditional to have to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4206.693s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So lifting that weight all this time, I'm sure, has got to be really difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4211.475s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I just want to say that from the Haitian Flag Day to the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4215.756s">[McLaughlin]</a>: The weekly, I mean, the school committee updates when the superintendent is very inclusive of different events, not only in the community, but nationally, the need for hiring diverse staff, all of those things I think have been exceptional.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4231.307s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I just wanted to sort of make a point here that I feel like there was some, again, and this is an artifact of DESE, I think there's some embedded<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4240.774s">[McLaughlin]</a>: names in here that I'm not sure necessarily go with culture and proficiency under professional culture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4247.057s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And again, I think that might be an artifact of a privileged system, frankly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4252.1s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I just wanted to put that piece out there that I think Dr. Edouard-Vincent has done a lot, and it can't be easy in that realm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4258.363s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I just want to let her know how much I appreciate her for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4444.185s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And may I ask member, through the chair, that any other, obviously, I think it's obvious, but just wanted to be sure that any other comment<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4455.208s">[McLaughlin]</a>: is included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4455.828s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And thank you for putting this all together through the chair, member Ruseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4459.31s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I did it last year and it's time consuming and tedious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4463.412s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so thanks for putting it together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4465.293s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But if any other comments could be added, and then if it's okay to just rename the evaluation as updated or final or something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4475.479s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So when we're deleting the other ones, we're not getting confused about what we have and what we don't, that would be super helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4482.502s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I second that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4510.367s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm sorry, I thought that, Mayor, may I?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4513.028s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4513.869s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I thought there were other comments or from earlier too that had not been or had been overlooked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4518.971s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So if there wasn't, I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4521.192s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But if there is, I would just ask that obviously that they can be included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4524.693s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4886.99s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, I just wanted to add, yeah, the school system as a whole, the community as a whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4891.092s">[McLaughlin]</a>: That's one thing, the superintendent individually, and I felt like particularly for an evaluation of the superintendent that, you know, this number was a little bit off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4900.616s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I appreciate member Rousseau sort of looking, you know, mentioning the district as a whole and some things that need to be worked on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4908.019s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But I think that that's a community effort and a collaborative effort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4911.28s">[McLaughlin]</a>: both from the school committee, from our families, from our teachers, from our staff, for everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4915.961s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's not one person that can direct any of that work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4918.642s">[McLaughlin]</a>: This is very difficult discussion and conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4921.963s">[McLaughlin]</a>: That's why they call them courageous conversations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4924.784s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But I think that this is work that we all have to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4927.104s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so I appreciate that the superintendent is leading the way in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4932.766s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I hope that we can support her and that our schools and our community will support the work as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5145.281s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5146.841s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Motion to approve?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5324.903s">[McLaughlin]</a>: She said she had to leave at 530 I wonder, but she's still on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5332.069s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Is the vice chair available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5350.796s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Vice versa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5352.117s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Oh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5428.755s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Through the chair, it was member Ruseau who motioned, and I seconded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5435.799s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Roll call, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5438.24s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think, excuse me, point of information, I think member Graham was asking for clarification that the motion was to approve the school committee calendar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5449.687s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=108.769s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=110.31s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And thank you, colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=111.811s">[McLaughlin]</a>: My apologies for having everyone reconvene, especially during the summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=117.254s">[McLaughlin]</a>: The superintendent evaluation that occurred last week, I noticed after doing some comparison to my evaluation that the Google Sheets form that I had used had been incorrect and some of the numbers<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=129.769s">[McLaughlin]</a>: were incorrect and actually added some comments as well that I thought were necessary, particularly after the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=136.591s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And the primary reason I think that the numbers were incorrect, again, was the Google Sheets, which automatically populates the form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=144.793s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And this is a process that's fairly new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=146.973s">[McLaughlin]</a>: This is the second time we've done this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=148.333s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Last year, I was a secretary, so I orchestrated the process last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=153.775s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So it's very different when you're<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=155.388s">[McLaughlin]</a>: sort of behind the scenes doing it as opposed to when you're submitting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=158.009s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I think that that was part of the problem and part of what was lost in translation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=162.01s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I wanted to apologize to Dr. Edouard-Vincent as well for my mistake and my error.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=167.671s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I'm asking my colleagues to consider the errors and allow me to resubmit my evaluation for the superintendent based on that error.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=194.276s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think member Graham has her hand raised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=233.524s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And thank you for the chair, thank you for that process aspect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=237.785s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I had forgotten that, so it's really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=240.865s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I'm making a motion, if I can, to ask that my colleagues accept my apologies and my mistake in the evaluation and allow me to resubmit the evaluation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=295.967s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=299.065s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I guess my point to that would be if there were mistakes on the previous evaluations that other folks did that they should, you know, be able to submit their evaluation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=308.189s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I certainly had mistakes and I'm owning those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=312.07s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And my concern is that if everybody's going to resubmit the evaluation, then we would, that potentially that would require another meeting to discuss the resubmissions of everyone on the evaluation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=323.315s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And if folks had errors on them,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=326.862s">[McLaughlin]</a>: then obviously I think they should be resubmitted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=329.063s">[McLaughlin]</a>: If folks didn't have errors on them, then I would, I guess, ask what that purpose is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=367.017s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=368.438s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, it's just the calculations because none of us saw the individual member reviews, which was part of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=374.858s">[McLaughlin]</a>: The issue in terms of the process frankly as I was reviewing the process from last year as well we had a calculation sheet that allowed us to see each other's reviews as we were doing our own which sort of informs the process without us working in silos.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=386.929s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think that's a discussion for another meeting and so I don't want to overstep the open meeting laws around that but the whole purpose is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=394.917s">[McLaughlin]</a>: it would recalculate in terms of that process, not necessarily affect the member reviews per se.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=403.705s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I leave it up to my colleagues as well, I believe Member Kreatz and Member Mustone have their hands up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=657.418s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=658.9s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Again, through the chair, I can understand that concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=662.343s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I do believe that before Member Ruseau left and he sent an email, said that he was not interested in changing his evaluation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=671.561s">[McLaughlin]</a>: You know, I do believe that, you know, anyone can make mistakes and that it's appropriate to correct them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=678.407s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I also believe to member pretz's point, and I believe that we're going to make it, you know, that we've discussed looking at the process come September, that there was also<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=691.918s">[McLaughlin]</a>: there's some confusion in the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=693.499s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I know Member Pex just said, and I would agree to disagree on this point with Member Pex, that we're not allowed to see each other's member reviews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=701.425s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I thought that was super informative last time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=703.827s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And we actually had a sheet that was created, a Google sheet that was created, and certainly not by me, but we can see from the last reviews on the tabs, there was the current review, and then there was an additional tab that was member reviews, and then it had sections of each member and how<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=717.36s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We had all reviewed and what our comments were and that was super informative because this is not one member evaluating the superintendent, this is, you know, all of us as collective evaluating the superintendent so we should be able to see and share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=730.778s">[McLaughlin]</a>: information on an evaluation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=732.179s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I don't know why this year we weren't able to, it didn't make any sense to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=736.862s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I guess, you know, maybe in retrospect, you know, I could have asked for the meeting to be rescheduled or something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=743.745s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But, you know, in addition to that, finding the errors on my part just made it even more obvious that, you know, the process was flawed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=751.91s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so really the purpose I thought of the meeting today based on what was posted publicly and for the agenda was that we would<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=760.675s">[McLaughlin]</a>: review the resubmitted evaluation process and vote to see if that would be approved, that I made a mistake and wanted the process approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=770.921s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So what was actually posted on the agenda, may I ask, because I didn't open it early.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=778.325s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Does Susie or Maurice have it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=780.506s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=1058.852s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I was just going to ask the superintendent her position on this, which I believe is to have time to be able to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=1067.968s">[McLaughlin]</a>: put these together and for us to meet early in the year so that we can all be on board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=1072.91s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think there was a little misunderstanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=1075.19s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It sounded through the chair, like there was a discussion about our goals and, you know, we have, we voted to have goals for the school committee as well for next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=1085.954s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But I believe, or I thought we were talking about the superintendent's goals, which of course, you know, should be aligned with our goals, but we haven't set the school committee goals either for the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=1097.8s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I guess I'd like to hear from Dr. Evey if we could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=1155.012s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Point of information, sorry, I'm sorry, excuse me, Superintendent, I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=1158.735s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Can you just share what MASS is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=1385.692s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=1386.212s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So thank you through the chair to member Graham for the clarification on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=1393.787s">[McLaughlin]</a>: The process, I think that clearly the year, June 17 was pretty packed with the budget stuff that was happening as we all know and other things that have been going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=1404.698s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I think that it is important for us to have a meeting in the fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=1410.403s">[McLaughlin]</a>: to discuss how we feel about the goals that have been proposed and early, you know, sooner than later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=1417.729s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then potentially the superintendent either revise or revisit those goals by 930, September 30th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=1426.695s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So if possible, if we could, you know, have a meeting early, you know, one of our first meetings be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=1432.259s">[McLaughlin]</a>: to address the goals that had been proposed and where we are as a school committee, but also in setting our own goals, as we said, we also passed a resolution that we would have goals for the school committee where we would also evaluate ourselves in our process or have some sort, either whether we evaluated ourselves or had someone else evaluate us, it's unclear, but that we would have an evaluation process for school committee as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=1455.749s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I guess with that understanding that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=1459.464s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm hearing the process and purpose of that resolution that had been previously passed was so that we might have some discussion around the goals that had been proposed before they're in play.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=1473.208s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And obviously there's work over the summer, but I think there's plenty of work to be done over the summer and that will align with the goals as well, that we can afford to have that meeting early September<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=1485.428s">[McLaughlin]</a>: to discuss the goals, the meeting that member Graham is mentioning for that was supposed to happen on the 17th, which again, I mean, I feel like June's a blur.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=1497.332s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I can't believe July 1st is tomorrow or the next day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=1501.073s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's all gone by so quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=1502.573s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And again, all the budget stuff that was happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=1504.294s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I think it's unfortunate that that calendar item wasn't met, but I think if we can make it one of the first items of the new year, I think that could be helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=1512.236s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I guess I,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=1514.23s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I would make a motion or ask for an amendment that we make one of our first meetings be a goal review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=1523.172s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then if that's okay with Dr. Edouard-Vincent, and then the response to that goal review by Dr. Edouard-Vincent could be potentially the September 30th, if my colleagues agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=1534.835s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I would make that friendly amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1299.017s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I just wanted to say thank you for the rapport.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1300.938s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And it was really good seeing everyone at curriculum night the other night and the great turnout and the increased attendance and interest in our vocational school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1308.081s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I know that you guys have all done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1310.086s">[McLaughlin]</a>: or collectively, it looks great over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1311.826s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I hope people are taking a tour around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1314.307s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm just excited by the opportunities for our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1316.908s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1318.068s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2002.815s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2005.057s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you for the presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2006.238s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's definitely an ambitious schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2007.979s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It looks like you guys are going to be really busy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2009.681s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I did have a couple of questions about how the PCAT review team will be selected, how we'll be addressing diversity and equity for the selection of the team, and also<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2024.428s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Specifically, I don't see a family representative on there, and I just wanted to make that recommendation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2028.77s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I also would make a recommendation for a special education representative and a EL representative, especially as we're thinking about how items translate, how words have varying meanings among different cultures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2043.515s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I would especially think about if we could differentiate instruction and universal design for learning for students with disabilities, as you can imagine, especially around<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2053.486s">[McLaughlin]</a>: sex education, puberty, that sort of stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2056.388s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I certainly have resources that I can share with you around some other curriculums that we've experienced that have been great, but definitely want us to be proactive as we're thinking about how we're differentiating that information for all of our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2069.195s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2314.078s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2314.338s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2315.839s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Just what's the time commitment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2317.139s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I know it said it's two times a month that you guys plan on meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2320.641s">[McLaughlin]</a>: How long are those meetings going to be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=2363.268s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And just lastly, I'm wondering if there's any sort of pediatrician or any role like that that you guys have considered for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2846.87s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2848.03s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2854.553s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes, now I am.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2855.513s">[McLaughlin]</a>: They unmuted me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2856.734s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3828.757s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Excellent, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4297.659s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yep, we will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6718.715s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7395.834s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7396.72s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm sorry I'm remote, but I wanted to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7399.837s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you for folks who are coming forward to speak up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7401.978s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think this is a really important issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7403.599s">[McLaughlin]</a>: This was, we actually had suspension and discipline on the agenda at the last meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7409.082s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And that was deferred to have school committee members come back with some notifications about what they wanted to ask about suspension and discipline particular to reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7418.906s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So we had had that on the last agenda and that hadn't happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7421.868s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I just wanted to mention that because that's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7424.749s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And it was one of the discussions that we had that we were gonna have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7429.711s">[McLaughlin]</a>: that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7430.191s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Um and then, you know this incident happened, and everybody obviously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7439.193s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Was in a tailspin dealing with all of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7441.113s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I also just wanted some clarification if I could on the on the section that says be it also resolved that the project scope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7448.975s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Will include recommendations to address<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7456.296s">[McLaughlin]</a>: past handling of incidents that are race, gender, or bullying biased.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7461.117s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Just specifically around that, I wanted to make an amendment that included disability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7466.978s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So race, disability, gender, or bullying bias is the request I'm making for an amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7501.554s">[McLaughlin]</a>: The MIC is not on sorry man.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7736.034s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7739.073s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you, I'm not sure if you can see my hand because it's on Facebook, sorry, or on Zoom, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7745.929s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I just wanted to be clear that Dr. Edouard-Vincent is our superintendent, and we are all part of the team, and it's all of our children, and we are all mothers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7758.56s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And when we talk about our schools, the community is part of our schools, our teachers are part of our schools, the school committee is part of our schools, our superintendent, the central administration team, all of us are part of our schools, and we all<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7773.372s">[McLaughlin]</a>: As Miss Branley was saying earlier, what can we do to help?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7775.654s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We all need to work together to be able to improve our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7779.537s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And to, I think it's unfair, frankly, to put blame on one person for anything that happens within our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7786.462s">[McLaughlin]</a>: This is a collective community environment for all of our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7790.245s">[McLaughlin]</a>: What happened is tragic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7792.126s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think we're all heartsick over it and we all want to improve our school and we're all here for the children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7797.699s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I just wanna just make that point because we're a team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7800.62s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I know Dr. Edouard-Vincent has been with our team for a few years now and it's not easy turning around a district after 25 to 27 years of somebody else being the lead in the district and a whole different administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7816.847s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I just had to say that, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7980.629s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes, with the amendment, yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8019.406s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8028.093s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I did, Melanie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8164.308s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10003.12s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10006.402s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10007.223s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I just wanted to thank Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10008.303s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Galusi for talking about the importance of the improvement rating so that it's not just about what the scores are, but that it's really about seeing students improving over time as well, because that's a really important piece of data that we're seeing the improvement piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10026.596s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So thank you for sharing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10035.811s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you, Member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10036.812s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We can continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10124.15s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10124.87s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10147.214s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10157.892s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=1138.388s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Hi, yeah, so I was curious if Shanine was asking us for a deliverable to recommend as part of what we're bringing forward from the subcommittee to the school committee that is included with the request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=1153.494s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm not sure what specifically you are asking for, Shanine, and I just wanted to make sure that we had some quick clarification on that, just like one, two, this is what I'm asking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=1900.264s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=1900.625s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I was just going to add that it you know this feels like the conversation that she was having at the top of the meeting around child directed play so it sounds like there's a lot of options and opportunities for different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=1913.615s">[McLaughlin]</a>: decisions that the child can make, you know, going from the library to whether they choose to, you know, switch out from an after school option to during the day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=1923.403s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I think that could cover it with a very clear definition, but I'm curious to hear what other folks think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=1930.789s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=2700.79s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=2701.27s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, I don't know I would disagree with some of that, respectfully, I think that in terms of recess I think it's super important for most kids and I do believe in logical consequences when logical consequences can be understood and when there's a direct correlation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=2715.839s">[McLaughlin]</a>: There's lots of times that you know kids with disabilities and others might not be able to understand the direct correlation between<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=2722.363s">[McLaughlin]</a>: recess and having it taken away and behavior.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=2725.025s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so that's much more complicated in terms of behavior plans and all of the things that we know go into place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=2730.608s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But, and a lot of times our kids who we may see more behavior with have a higher need for exercise, like folks who might be identified as having ADHD or things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=2743.135s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So, and we also potentially see disproportionality in,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=2749.179s">[McLaughlin]</a>: punishment, if you will, for students with disabilities and minorities, particularly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=2755.143s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Not necessarily speaking specifically to our district and our data, but we know that that's an issue in education as a whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=2761.788s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And hopefully we will be looking at some of our data overall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=2764.53s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But I think that those are factors that need to be considered as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=2768.213s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And back to what Shannon was saying a few minutes ago as well in terms of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=2774.976s">[McLaughlin]</a>: you know, ensuring that families have and understand home notices for requirements for their children to go outside or what have you, I think maybe we could work with the community to ensure that there are some extra, especially at the elementary, well, at all the school levels, that there are extra codes, like what we saw at Missituk with the PTO at Missituk, because there may be families that actually don't have that, or, you know, families where they're not able to provide that or don't understand what's being asked of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=2802.245s">[McLaughlin]</a>: whole host of situations that I just want to make sure we're thinking outside the margins for all of our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=2810.648s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3240.118s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3240.538s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I want to just also comment on micromanaging I think that you know you guys are professionals we know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3249.124s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And we know that you're got a lot of things that you're handling and a lot of balls in the air that you have to handle so and I know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3256.871s">[McLaughlin]</a>: it takes more than one person, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3258.633s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So it's not one principal, it's not one superintendent, it's not one school committee member, it's all of us together collectively as a community working on improving our schools and our BCBAs and our school adjustment Councilors and all of those things that we clearly need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3273.006s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so I guess to Mr. O'Brien's point, I would say, is there data collected on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3278.931s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Because I think it would be really interesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3280.593s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I know you as educators know that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3282.955s">[McLaughlin]</a>: data tells a story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3283.935s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so really looking at what your data is telling you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3286.676s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So if you are doing, if teachers are doing that, what is the data telling you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3291.917s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Who are the people that that is happening to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3294.198s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Who are the teachers that are doing that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3295.938s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Is there disproportionality there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3297.558s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Is there not?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3299.219s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think that really sort of being able to have some of the data on that too is important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3303.18s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so that can help us really understand better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3307.781s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Because I think part of the, and I may be mistaken, but I think part of the reason that this is being brought<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3313.502s">[McLaughlin]</a>: to the policy floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3314.843s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And part of it is because we didn't have one, but also because as school committee members and as community members, we hear, we do hear stories from families specifically around some of these consequences around recess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3330.452s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And we want to be able to bring families and schools together and families and administrators together to make sure that we're all coming up with effective solutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3339.917s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I would just encourage if that was going to be the case, that data be collected and that somehow that data be disaggregated and shared so that we can understand what that is and what it looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3350.739s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3939.773s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3940.874s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Um, yeah, so I guess to that point in terms of the data, um, you know, some families may not know that their Children are not going to recess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3950.503s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So, you know, we do have some Children in the district who do not communicate with words who, you know, um, you know, are not able to tell their family if they went out to recess that day or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3959.732s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So the question I have as well in terms of the data is our families being notified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3964.756s">[McLaughlin]</a>: You know, if<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3965.848s">[McLaughlin]</a>: their child is not allowed to go to recess and how.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=3968.632s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so I guess that's a piece of it too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=4717.385s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Sorry, driving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=4719.967s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I wanted to thank everyone for being here and thank you for recapping what we wanted to look at I'm wondering when you're saying the next meeting which meeting you mean, because there's lots of meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=4731.255s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So that's one thing and then the other is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=4735.017s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I love the idea of professional development and I know you know some people may grown at you know additional professional development, what have you, but having you know just come back from the mass association of school committees conference association of school superintendent conference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=4748.47s">[McLaughlin]</a>: There were so many great sessions there and there were some sessions specific to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=4753.795s">[McLaughlin]</a>: and specific to just, you know, the social emotional needs of kids in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=4759.396s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And we know that we are in a mental health crisis around, you know, the pandemic and the data and what we're seeing in terms of data for increase in behavioral health supports and needs and counseling and, you know, hospitalization and suicides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=4776.94s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I mean, all of it, it's just off the hook as I'm sure you guys are dealing with every single day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=4783.807s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I support very much the professional development piece, and I thank you for bringing that up, because I think it's an important piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=4830.732s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Sorry, just for the rest of the room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=4832.053s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And that's, that's all drafted in subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=4834.273s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But then that has to go before our entire committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=4837.674s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then they, you know, based on recommendations or not, vote on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=4841.954s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So this is not a final, you know, process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Azob8X18NRY&t=4845.175s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's just one step in the next process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2781.794s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Make a motion to take the good of the order off the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2802.142s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2804.388s">[McLaughlin]</a>: for the good of the order, which is basically us assessing how we're doing collaboratively as a school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2809.95s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And we review monthly what we need to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2812.59s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I know in the past we talked about and we approved a motion for us to meet to set school committee goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2819.932s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I know that we talked about that potentially happening as a committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2825.113s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I was wondering if we could consider this as a committee of the whole before one of our monthly meetings next month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2832.313s">[McLaughlin]</a>: and in which case, if we do, I know that I shared some information earlier about the MASC conference, but there was definitely a session there in particular that the MASC offers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2841.395s">[McLaughlin]</a>: In fact, it's our rep, Dorothy Presser, that offers it specifically on school committee goals, but also aligning those goals with superintendent goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2849.097s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I'm sure that could be available to us as a recording.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2852.898s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think they recorded several of the sessions and or as a PowerPoint, if we want those ahead of time to prepare for the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2858.519s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I guess I'm putting out there for my colleagues<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2862.67s">[McLaughlin]</a>: if we can consider a meeting, a committee of the whole to address our school committee goals here for next month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2932.57s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think that's a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2933.57s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I was also wondering, and thank you for bringing that up through the chair, member Hays, because I was wondering if there's an opportunity<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2939.842s">[McLaughlin]</a>: for them to have a microphone as well so that they don't have to come and sit with us sort of to be able to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2945.125s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So if we can get, even if, I mean, there's so many opportunities for wireless mics, whatever here, we don't have to have them wired in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2951.088s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm sure between our media center and John McLaughlin, we can get something set up so that there's a microphone where they are able to stay in their seat and speak like the rest of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2960.232s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think that would be helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3010.107s">[McLaughlin]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3012.409s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Is there any kind of a timeline on when that might happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3014.611s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I know sometimes it can take a while for the technology piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3017.232s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So maybe in the interim, we could start with a wireless option or something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3030.057s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, for now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3030.737s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3037.04s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes, there we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3037.661s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you, Mr. McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3038.341s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you, John.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3039.362s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then lastly, is there an opportunity that we can get them just a student rep nameplate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3046.305s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3067.302s">[McLaughlin]</a>: That would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3067.922s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4705.017s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you, thank you for the information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4706.498s">[McLaughlin]</a>: There's helpful information here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4709.379s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I wanted to ask if the, to clarify if the 37H and a half and 37H and three quarter are specific to students with disability, or are there other items on here that are specific to students with disability?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4761.78s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4762.14s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So that manifestation hearing happens if there's a 10 day suspension, is that right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4766.302s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's if you get more than 10 days cumulatively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4770.144s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Cumulatively over the year, it doesn't have to be consecutively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4774.185s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4774.506s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then the manifestation hearing is a manifestation of whether their disability influenced the discipline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4801.016s">[McLaughlin]</a>: That's super helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4801.637s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I just want people to understand the nuances of the law, which obviously all law has nuance,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4807.951s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I really appreciate you mentioning that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4809.292s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thanks so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4810.133s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4810.653s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5523.229s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5524.35s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5525.991s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Bowen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5526.271s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I know this is a lot of work to put together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5529.131s">[McLaughlin]</a>: This is not obviously the coordinated program review this is the annual le a correct so we it's it's Ted focus monitoring now so there's no longer the correct morning yeah yeah it's yeah so we had done that they love to change that they do they just so you see FM and that was last year where we yeah right yeah and that's the every three year one and yes the annual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5550.39s">[McLaughlin]</a>: to differentiate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5551.331s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5552.031s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then the indicators, those are the SPP APR indicators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5555.314s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Is that what you're talking about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5556.415s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5556.775s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5557.596s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Would it be possible, and if not, I can go online and get it if you're not, or if your staff's not available, but would it be possible to get a list of the indicators, just indicators one through nine?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5569.084s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So it's a single sheet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5571.366s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Let me just get it for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5576.79s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So it looks like this, it says IVC.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5578.932s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5580.836s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So that's, thank you, that's super helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5583.037s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so those are all, yeah, looking at, those are all the indicators that the state looks at in terms of the special education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5613.283s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So do they randomize what indicators that we report on at the beginning and the end?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5654.902s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Okay, so if I understand you correctly, you're saying that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5657.84s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's a randomized indicator list that you get at the beginning of the year that tell you what indicators your cohorts going to be responsible for reporting on correct have the 17 indicators that there are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5668.404s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so you get to annually that you report no currently we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5678.967s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So that would be great if maybe at the beginning of the year, if we could know what the three are, if you wouldn't mind letting us know in the beginning of the year what the three are that are being reported on so we can kind of keep an eye on those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5691.294s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I can actually show you the schedule of what it looks like and what the activities are that we're responsible throughout the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5697.157s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Sure, that would be awesome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5697.958s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5698.338s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then what was the other thing I was going to ask you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5702.135s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Oh, and thank you for the breakdown on the public school monitoring compliance in terms of the PRS complaints, that's super helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5710.137s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We've asked PRS for that data in the past, and it's been a little bit trickier to get, so it's nice to hear it from you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5715.598s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Much appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5717.218s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then regarding 504 and OCR, were there any, so Office of Civil Rights complaint or the procedural safeguards for 504, but also students with IEPs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5727.56s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I know there was the public school monitoring, was there any OCR complaints?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5730.681s">[McLaughlin]</a>: No, there were not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5731.361s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5732.1s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5733.001s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then a 78.3%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5736.245s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And certainly while there's, you know, there's been lots of great things that have been happening, I don't know what the great equivalent is just not being a teacher and having had a report card myself a little while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5745.916s">[McLaughlin]</a>: What would a 78.3% be a great equivalent, I would say, maybe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5766.46s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So if you could generalize with a B minus or a C plus, if you were talking to your student or somebody, you know, your child and you were saying, okay, what, you know, you did okay, but let's think about what the room for improvement is and what can we work on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5778.144s">[McLaughlin]</a>: What would you say those things?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5813.45s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5814.27s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then just one last thing there was what was the other one that was the 68.5% to six out of eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5821.856s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So one was the two out of four, which is the annual dropout rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5824.558s">[McLaughlin]</a>: The other one was the six out of eight, which was the indicators five and six, which is my indicator cheat sheet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5830.58s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Five and six are educational environments and preschool environment, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5833.561s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5834.381s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So educational environment or percentage of children with IEPs, five and six served inside regular class, 80% or more inside regular class, less than 40%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5844.786s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So it's the inclusion rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5846.646s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5853.349s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, yeah, I see the criteria.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5854.95s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5855.81s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So is that saying that there's room for improvement<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5858.83s">[McLaughlin]</a>: on our inclusion data?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5860.071s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5861.052s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5862.013s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5862.713s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Super helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6370.703s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member McLaughlin, I just have one more question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6372.645s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6373.966s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I just wanted to know about guidance when we get guidance from OSAP or from DESE.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6378.33s">[McLaughlin]</a>: You know, I know that there was the disability guidance, I mean, the discipline guidance that we had over the summer from OSAP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6384.995s">[McLaughlin]</a>: There's just different letters that come out from the Office of Special Education Planning and Policy and from DESE as a whole in terms of disability related issues across the country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6396.128s">[McLaughlin]</a>: but that are specific to our state as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6398.069s">[McLaughlin]</a>: How does that information get distributed from your office?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6421.995s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6423.54s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Does the general education population teachers get any of that guidance information or does that come strictly to the tails and disseminate from them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6677.278s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6679.739s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6680.619s">[McLaughlin]</a>: No, this wasn't offered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6682.04s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6682.4s">[McLaughlin]</a>: That was great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6682.88s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, there's a typo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6684.841s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I just wanted to make note of it is college life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6686.722s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I see that you recognize that, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6688.623s">[McLaughlin]</a>: That could be reflected and fixed in the minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6692.124s">[McLaughlin]</a>: That would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6693.824s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And as the superintendent was saying earlier, this is a landmark.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6698.271s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Legislation that representative Garber Lee was a key.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6703.535s">[McLaughlin]</a>: driver in the macy legislation so macy is mass inclusive concurrent enrollment program and.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6713.542s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Sean has just really represented Garber Lee has just really been pushing this uphill for several years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6718.233s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And as stated for our students that don't achieve MCAS passing on the 10th grade MCAS, which is a requirement for a high school diploma, this allows them to go to post-secondary education and for their, not to be impeded by their disability to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6735.465s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So these students can attend college life and be part of a college campus and all those things that are afforded to students without disabilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6743.71s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's a big, big deal for,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6747.827s">[McLaughlin]</a>: families and students with disabilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6749.829s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I just want to publicly recognize Representative Garber for the work through a formal letter that can come from the superintendent's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6756.314s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm happy to help you compose the letter if you feel that there's a need for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6760.637s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But something that's just formally recognizing is really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6763.359s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then also the resolution that the Macy initiative is recognized in our public school district as part of our high school transition program, which I know that that's been the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6773.777s">[McLaughlin]</a>: As it was being formed and before it was actually law when it was just the inclusive concurrent enrollment program it was called ice at the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6783.119s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But I know that it's state law i'm sure that it will be part of the transition program I just want to make sure that it's recognized it such by this body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6791.921s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So if I could have a motion to approve, I would appreciate it motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6800.834s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7019.124s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7020.425s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7020.985s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So, yes, I'm just looking for information on all of these data points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7026.469s">[McLaughlin]</a>: There are some of this on our DESE student profiles, which I'd like to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7032.852s">[McLaughlin]</a>: reviewed when we do go over the report which is indicated here in terms of the data elements and I would encourage colleagues if there's anything else that they wanted to add here to please do so but I think that this is important information that we can all benefit from so hoping that we can get this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7113.052s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Sure, that would be in comparison to the data that's here as well, because I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7117.193s">[McLaughlin]</a>: The question number five should answer some of that around the incident reports collected and how we're notified in terms of the data for the discipline that you're talking about, but I'd be willing to accept that amendment and make a motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7199.897s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7202.384s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So, I heard you on the first three but I'm not sure what you mean by other because that can be really vast for the administration to try to address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7224.052s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7224.713s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So, I guess I would just clarify that to say and if there are other what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7231.487s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So did you, if you got that, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7235.148s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Sorry, that was a mouthful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7236.429s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It was a mouthful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7238.149s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I would accept that and make a motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=32.397s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=38.582s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=974.005s">[McLaughlin]</a>: you're not willing to listen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=999.605s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1001.727s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think it's unfortunate when a city Councilor won't have a back and forth with constituents as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1006.011s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I am a constituent and I would like to have a conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1008.553s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I would say that it is inaccurate to say that nothing has been done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1012.576s">[McLaughlin]</a>: That's not accurate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1013.657s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Number one, our police have been involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1015.899s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Our school Councilors have been involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1017.741s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And particularly from someone who served on the other side of this table, and you know what the restrictions are, to sit here and politicize in front of cameras is completely egregious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1026.624s">[McLaughlin]</a>: and unacceptable, I'm sorry, Mr. Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1029.785s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And my children go to school as well, and I worry about all of our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1033.327s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm not here because it's enjoyable, I'm here because I care as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1175.318s">[McLaughlin]</a>: There are laws that we have to follow, and I know that you understand that because you were on their side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1180.219s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But you're not explaining that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1313.856s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1314.396s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I wanted to add in terms of the isolated incident, I believe that, you know, if there are officers here and or the superintendent that wants to speak to what that actually means, it means that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1323.922s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It was an isolated incident in the bathroom in that instance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1326.443s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It does not mean that there's not a systemic issue that has been ongoing and that we understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1331.144s">[McLaughlin]</a>: This was an isolated incident today in terms of what happened to this individual student in the school today at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1337.206s">[McLaughlin]</a>: That was the isolated incident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1338.507s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's not that any of these are isolated incidents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1341.108s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We know there's a systemic issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1343.008s">[McLaughlin]</a>: That's why we're here to try to help change that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1345.089s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But it takes more than seven people to change a school district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1348.49s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It takes a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1349.69s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It takes a community working together<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1351.67s">[McLaughlin]</a>: to change a school district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1352.552s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It takes a city council that is willing to work with their school committee and not get up here and yell at them in front of TV cameras.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1360.126s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It takes working together as a community, all of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1364.525s">[McLaughlin]</a>: and being good examples for our children, not bullying each other, not yelling at each other, not fighting with each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1859.842s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I just I just remember my girlfriend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1867.345s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1867.967s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I just wanted to thank the students for their bravery and coming up and speaking I think it's really important and I think it's really important that the students know that you can reach out to us an email phone call phone number everything's published on the website, you can reach out to us anytime to we don't know some of the circumstances that you're sharing because we're not necessarily allowed to know I'm not asking that you're sharing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1886.795s">[McLaughlin]</a>: private information about other folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1888.256s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But I am saying in your own experience, if you wanted to share your own experience, we're here to listen to you as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1893.38s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Because some of the things I think I knew that before I was on school committee, I assumed school committee knew everything that was going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1899.964s">[McLaughlin]</a>: That's not accurate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1901.285s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We don't know everything that's going on, because there are personnel issue, there are FERPA, there's lots of laws that don't allow us to know specifics of what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1908.59s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I know people think, keep thinking,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1910.271s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Oh, they keep saying laws and laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1911.512s">[McLaughlin]</a>: No, there really is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1912.392s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We're not even, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1913.772s">[McLaughlin]</a>: There's other people from the community come to me and tell me things that they understand from their children, telling them that in high school, I don't know the circumstances because central administration is not allowed to tell us certain things because of laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1926.037s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So it's really important that you guys know that we are, you're our constituents as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1930.099s">[McLaughlin]</a>: You can reach out anytime.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1931.519s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think it's really brave that you're willing to get up tonight and speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=1934.04s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2378.21s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I just want to say thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2379.311s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think it's, I'm really sorry about what happened to your daughter, and what continues to happen to your daughter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2384.214s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think coming up and offering solutions like an example of that is a really great<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2389.648s">[McLaughlin]</a>: example of things that we can do and that we can put into place I think you're right you know we should be able to send out a letter and say if your child is not involved in email or something on our website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2398.518s">[McLaughlin]</a>: If your child if you weren't contacted your child was not involved, I think that's completely reasonable and I think being able to have back and forth with folks like you who have had real experience on the ground is really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2408.362s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I wanna hear from you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2409.222s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I haven't heard from you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2409.822s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I would really like to hear from you, especially when you say your daughter's different and she's being bullied because she's different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2414.624s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Nobody should be bullied and especially nobody should be bullied because they're different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2417.685s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So however we can help, I do wanna talk and think about positive solutions that we can come up with together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2423.426s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So please reach out or leave me your, I'll take your phone, whatever, leave your number whenever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2427.607s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I'm really, really sorry about your daughter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2430.348s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And if there's anything I can do to help improve that, please really reach out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2434.229s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I know my colleagues feel similarly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2470.958s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Wow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=2471.398s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3493.678s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I just wanted to ask if I might speak in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3497.099s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3497.639s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3499.399s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I just, thank you, Mr. Began.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3502.073s">[McLaughlin]</a>: for your comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3503.054s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think that there's a little bit of misinformation in that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3506.997s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I'm sorry that people feel that we're being corny, but I do have to say that there are very strict laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3512.542s">[McLaughlin]</a>: However, that said, in terms of FERPA and other things, I know people don't wanna hear it, but it is the fact, like it really is, number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3519.427s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Number two, we should care about all of our kids, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3522.449s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We really should care about all of our kids and we really should.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3525.432s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I don't know the circumstances of today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3527.073s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I know what I'm hearing from other people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3528.514s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I know what the bit that I've heard<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3530.456s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Um, from, from administration or what have you, but I don't know the details.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3533.859s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I don't even entirely know the details from the previous event because of some of the things that I am not literally allowed to know because of the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3541.264s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Now you guys do because, or I assume many do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3544.707s">[McLaughlin]</a>: If you have children in the high school, your children can come home and tell you who that child was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3548.79s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Maybe if you have kids in elementary school that you don't, it gets to the grapevine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3552.172s">[McLaughlin]</a>: People start talking in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3553.473s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It was this kid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3554.034s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It was that kid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3554.834s">[McLaughlin]</a>: That's how people know who that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3556.075s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3556.816s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3557.574s">[McLaughlin]</a>: You know, as a, as an individual, we can't say that, but I do want to say like going back to the bullying law, when we're talking about laws being changed, laws being changed, like the bullying law in Massachusetts, do people know how that law was created?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3568.099s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3569.06s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Phoebe, right from Western Massachusetts, the girl that was bullied to death, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3573.382s">[McLaughlin]</a>: That was the law that happened here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3575.043s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We don't, none of us want to see this happen with our kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3577.604s">[McLaughlin]</a>: None of us want to see a Parkland.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3579.825s">[McLaughlin]</a>: or Newtown or any of those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3582.108s">[McLaughlin]</a>: This is horrible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3583.009s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We know this is horrible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3584.431s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm losing sleep over it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3585.572s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm sure you guys are losing sleep over it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3587.474s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's my kids too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3588.315s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's your kids too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3589.476s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We all really care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3590.438s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I know people are groaning because it's like drone on, drone on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3592.9s">[McLaughlin]</a>: You know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3593.421s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I care too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3594.402s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I really, really do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3596.384s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And what are we going to do about it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3599.505s">[McLaughlin]</a>: People are coming up here saying change the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3601.486s">[McLaughlin]</a>: How do you change the law?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3602.787s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Do you guys know how you do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3605.568s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Same thing, I've been advocating for years for laws to be changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3608.569s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I go to the State House, I protest, I do hearings, I give my story, I do all kinds of stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3613.07s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I don't just get to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3614.591s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Change the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3615.391s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I wish I did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3616.792s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3617.932s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But we can, as a community, get together and make a friggin' difference and change our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3622.833s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Like, we can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3624.334s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So we have to work together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3625.614s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We can't fight with each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3628.075s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Follow the handbook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3628.895s">[McLaughlin]</a>: If it says, okay, if it says, if the handbook says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3632.216s">[McLaughlin]</a>: okay if a handbook says there's a weapon and if the handbook says there's a weapon and weapons result in expulsion if that's what the handbook says then that I assume is going to be what is going to be happening because that is what the handbook says but if there's a legal issue that we don't know about because maybe there's some presumption of innocence for something not this case I don't know I'm talking about any cases we don't know all the details nor do you so we can't just automatically and arbitrarily say this is what should happen with that kid and that's what should happen with this kid that's not how it works<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3662.117s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3663.158s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I can sit here and argue with you guys all day long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3664.858s">[McLaughlin]</a>: You don't want to hear it because you're angry, and I don't blame you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3667.62s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, blah, blah, blah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3669.14s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3669.46s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I don't blame you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3670.521s">[McLaughlin]</a>: When your kid is in danger, you feel your kid is threatened, I would be the exact same way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3674.863s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I have been the exact same way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3676.704s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We should be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3677.564s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But how do we turn this negativity into community and frigging collaborate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3682.106s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Oh, just follow the handbook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3683.387s">[McLaughlin]</a>: That's all we have to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3684.827s">[McLaughlin]</a>: No, that's not all we have to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3686.008s">[McLaughlin]</a>: That's not going to change at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3687.649s">[McLaughlin]</a>: No, it's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3688.769s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I disagree, but I'm happy to work with anybody that does want to make positive change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3692.673s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3693.154s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=5671.825s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, the specifics about who the other students were with regard to your daughter's situation, I still don't know their names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7260.874s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7261.315s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I just wanted to say it is a very complicated issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7263.436s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I appreciate Gail Reggie and saying that earlier, but also all the family members and especially like the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7269.124s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Like member Graham was saying a moment ago, the students that came out tonight, it was exceptionally brave, particularly Jacqueline on her 16th birthday was exceptionally brave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7277.886s">[McLaughlin]</a>: What no one should have to go through, what any of these children have gone through, both as people who have been there and seen what's happened and people who have been victims.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7287.908s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think that we all recognize that bullying is not something new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7294.13s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's something that's been ongoing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7295.43s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It escalates for sure during times of stress and tension,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7299.206s">[McLaughlin]</a>: This has been an extremely stressful couple of years for everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7302.727s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Last year, we had a family and community engagement assessment come in from DESE to talk about family and community engagement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7308.968s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And we weren't ready for that assessment because we were just really trying to recover from getting our kids back into school and COVID.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7315.79s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But one of the things that they did say that these outside folks said was that we had a lot of work to do on family and community engagement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7325.772s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And they offered to come back again<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7327.745s">[McLaughlin]</a>: and work with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7328.505s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And we were not able to do that because we were so prioritizing so many other things and family engagement has to be critical for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7334.806s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It has to be something where it is a back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7337.187s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So we're not shouting at each other and trying to figure out who's blaming who and shame and everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7342.087s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We have to work together to be able to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7343.568s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I know that I've been saying this earlier tonight and most especially, most especially we have to listen to the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7349.529s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So we have to figure out a way that we're gonna listen to the students too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7353.269s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I appreciate member Graham's motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7355.31s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I second that and I'm sure we'll have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7356.97s">[McLaughlin]</a>: deeper conversations about how we're going to do that, but we are going to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7360.468s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We're going to find a forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7362.17s">[McLaughlin]</a>: and more than one for our students to be heard as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7364.591s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I want folks that are out there listening to know that, but also I know that there are folks out there, you know who you are, who we've dealt with other stuff last year, maybe the year before related to bullying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7375.956s">[McLaughlin]</a>: This is not the first time of bullying in Medford public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7378.497s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's not the first time bullying in most public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7380.998s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It is an ongoing issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7382.079s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We see this, especially, I sent a family member, I mean, a community member, an article from Ed Week this week that talked about the higher incidence and rate of violence in our public schools right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7391.696s">[McLaughlin]</a>: and bullying and what's happening in the mental health, major mental health crisis we have nationally in our country, both because of the pandemic, but also because we're all at each other's throats because we're exhausted and beat and tired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7402.105s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And the kids are watching this too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7403.747s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I just hope that we can figure out a way that we're going to be able to collaborate and work together to move forward because that's where I'm at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7409.772s">[McLaughlin]</a>: That's what I want to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7410.973s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I really appreciate member Graham's motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7413.135s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I second that motion and thank you all for tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7415.297s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I know it was painful and it's going to continue to be painful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7418.075s">[McLaughlin]</a>: adaptive work, so technical work is the stuff that's the low-hanging fruit, the things you can do sort of easily, lock the doors, maybe get an SRO, things that are sort of technical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7426.963s">[McLaughlin]</a>: The adaptive change, the changing our hearts and minds, really being able to think about what the root of the problem is, that's painful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7432.587s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It takes longer, but we can do it if we're able to work together to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7436.451s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I know that we can, and I hope that we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7438.192s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8671.162s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8671.583s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It was a great podcast, by the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8673.224s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I highly recommend it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8674.768s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Um, but it's also sort of going back to, so that's the other thing is that the science of reading is not new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8680.49s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It, you know, it was one thing and then people tried something else for awhile and then they're going back to sort of what has been known to be the fundamental of phonics and really looking at the science of it, as opposed to just sort of the practice and trying new things and what's actually worked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9608.657s">[McLaughlin]</a>: May I?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9727.627s">[McLaughlin]</a>: May I?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9729.163s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9730.564s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm Melanie McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9732.085s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm a school committee member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9733.005s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm also a parent of three, two Medford high school graduates, one current Medford public school student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9739.409s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I've lived in Medford for 23 years and I'm here tonight specifically because I want to support the superintendent in her role and because I want to support the school committee and the parents and families and students in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9753.036s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We're all heartbroken about what has happened to our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9757.051s">[McLaughlin]</a>: over the past few months, but it has not been just the past few months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9760.553s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And there are plenty of people in the community that know that and that understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9764.134s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It has been years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9765.475s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We've had a bullying problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9766.696s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Most high schools have bullying problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9768.336s">[McLaughlin]</a>: There's a rise in violence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9770.397s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's national.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9771.158s">[McLaughlin]</a>: You can see it all over the country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9772.939s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It is happening particularly because of pandemic, but also because of the politicized nature of the hatred that exists in communities between polarized sides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9783.003s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And our children are often mimicking what they're seeing their adults do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9786.567s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And what I think is really important is what we've heard from city council members who are talking about finding solutions to work together, to collaborate, to change systems for all of our children, not some of our children, all of our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9798.173s">[McLaughlin]</a>: This has been ongoing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9799.013s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We're talking about not just the past four years of this administration, meaning this particular superintendent, this has been an ongoing problem from when other people were on school committee, from when people have been around for some time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9809.519s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I wanna clarify for the community and for city councilors, I'm not afraid of being yelled at,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9816.311s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I just don't like it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9817.571s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think it's inappropriate and unprofessional.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9820.352s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And when we talk about bullying in our community, I have never seen more of an example of bullying in our community than I see in the city council chambers every single week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9829.996s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think that everybody in the community would agree with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9842.25s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Ok Mr. Scarpelli. I think we both know each other well, George.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9844.051s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We're all neighbors here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9844.951s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We all know each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9846.311s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We all know each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9847.552s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Our children play together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9859.017s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So the ongoing bullying is inappropriate and is what our children are seeing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9862.799s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And that's what I would like to specifically point out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9865.081s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We wanna figure out how to work, should collaborate together to change outcomes for all children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9870.964s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I'm not gonna be shamed, I'm not gonna be blamed and I'm not gonna be named and neither should any of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9876.146s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I would ask that our city council members across the board and that our community across the board stand up to bullies everywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9883.17s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And we make sure that this stops in our community and in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9887.27s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I'm here to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9888.151s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I'm here to roll up my sleeves and help make sure that that happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9890.692s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think we all should be doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9910.0s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Uh huh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10056.144s">[McLaughlin]</a>: The social media piece of it is really upsetting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10071.642s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's a huge challenge, especially for bullying, especially for videos being distributed, for videos being given to the news media, for information being shared, for people politicizing situation is terrible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10082.31s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And the children are the social media piece of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10085.532s">[McLaughlin]</a>: The bullying element on social media is compounded exponentially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10090.515s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So when we talk about resources that we need, we need resources to help support our children's mental health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10095.339s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It is a mental health crisis right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10097.287s">[McLaughlin]</a>: because of what people are dealing with on the daily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10205.413s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Can I, may I please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10209.233s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So this is what we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10210.694s">[McLaughlin]</a>: This is the barraging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10211.794s">[McLaughlin]</a>: This is the sort of,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10212.779s">[McLaughlin]</a>: you know, back and forth with people trying to intimidate people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10215.241s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think it's really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10239.237s">[McLaughlin]</a>: May I?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10242.95s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes, for one moment, if you don't mind, Superintendent, is that okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10249.173s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm not answering your question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10250.494s">[McLaughlin]</a>: May I, through the chair?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10253.435s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10254.316s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I just wanted to say that to Councilor Tseng and Councilor Collins remarks earlier about people who are intimidated to come up to this podium and who are not able to speak for a number of reasons publicly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10269.008s">[McLaughlin]</a>: to please feel free to reach out for solution oriented options, because we are willing and open to listen to community members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10274.552s">[McLaughlin]</a>: This is a community problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10276.033s">[McLaughlin]</a>: This is not seven people that are gonna solve a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10277.995s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's not one person that's gonna solve a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10279.896s">[McLaughlin]</a>: This is a community systemic problem, and it's a national problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10283.579s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And we need all hands working together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10285.4s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We don't need people yelling at people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10286.861s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We need people collaborating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10288.602s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10348.334s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's the superintendent that's answering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10576.407s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=93.656s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Well, I think that, um, you know, the point of having goals was that so that we could identify as in, it says in the, in the MASC, MASS, um, conference handout so that we can identify to the community what our work is, what our goals are and to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=111.358s">[McLaughlin]</a>: be able at the end to show some evaluative process about how we attended and reached our goals, much like the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=120.064s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so that our goals are aligning with the superintendent's goals and that we're being very clear on what our roles as school committee members are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=130.531s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And again, how we can create measurable goals so that we can show at the end of a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=138.317s">[McLaughlin]</a>: a term or session, depending on what the committee decides, how we achieve those goals that we said, or whether we achieve the goals that we said, or whether they need to be restructured.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=147.622s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I really wanted to open a discussion based on the MASC recommendations for setting goals for school committee around what those could be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=156.426s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And, you know, I think that they are very clear about not setting many, you know, setting, you know, between one and three goals and, you know, and thinking that it could be, you know, sensibly,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=168.378s">[McLaughlin]</a>: for the either the school year or since we're so far into this school year it could be january to january sort of leave it open for discussion with the colleagues thanks oh sounds great thank you member mclaughlin so i know i mean i can speak from the chair with regards to setting a process for the evaluation i think that meeting went really<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=553.854s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, no, I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=557.715s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think thinking about buckets is a really good idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=560.436s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so I would agree with structure and process being one of the buckets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=565.297s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then I would say, I guess the other would be impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=568.373s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think we really should be thinking about the evaluative process for ourselves as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=572.616s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So first, I think we need to set a term of what the goal term would be, but then also, you know, what is the process at the end of the term for evaluation in terms of whether we've reached the goals or whether we haven't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=584.162s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So those are other things that I think we should be thinking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=586.264s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then in terms of, you know, structure and process, I think certainly the onboarding is something that's been discussed among colleagues as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=594.829s">[McLaughlin]</a>: You know, the need for an onboarding process,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=597.991s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Um, particularly for, you know, especially with a new election coming up and, you know, folks who, um, don't have institutional knowledge, what have you being able to have some onboarding process and also, um, the training that the MASC offers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=611.416s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So, you know, um, I think technically we're required each as school committee members to do the training.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=617.639s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm not sure what that followup process is in terms of whether people have actually done the training or not, um, with MASC and how we follow up on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=625.402s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I would say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=626.701s">[McLaughlin]</a>: you know, both the onboard in terms of structure and process, but the onboarding and ensuring that the professional development slash training is actually happening for each member would be something that I would put forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=640.129s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then in terms of impact, I think as we're thinking about district goals as a whole, I think we've heard a lot of talk about equity and we've heard a lot of talk about family engagement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=653.217s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I'd really like to think about those two<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=656.558s">[McLaughlin]</a>: aspects of impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=657.858s">[McLaughlin]</a>: How are we actually increasing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=662.039s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Are we increasing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=663.019s">[McLaughlin]</a>: How are we thinking about increasing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=664.58s">[McLaughlin]</a>: What are we doing to ensure family and community engagement and equity across that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=671.421s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think there's very data driven ways to measure those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=676.682s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think setting a benchmark for those would be really helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=682.603s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1054.493s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think to member kretz's point in terms of thinking about the time frame for this meeting now, maybe even setting some ideas about what we can accomplish in this meeting in one hour and maybe what we can accomplish is how many goals do we want to set<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1070.803s">[McLaughlin]</a>: you know, when can we revisit what the goals will be specifically, maybe taking some time to think about this for the next meeting, what, you know, say your top three goals are of the things that were discussed and how we might make those measurable would be something that I would put out and suggest I can make a motion in a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1088.85s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But I also wanted to say to member Hays' point around videos.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1095.232s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think that that's a really interesting point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1098.533s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think that the studio is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1100.77s">[McLaughlin]</a>: incredibly underutilized, particularly for getting information out to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1105.911s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Ideally, I would love to see videos that were in multiple languages, being able to describe what the school committee does and how we do what we do and how to contact us, I think could be super helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1119.033s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I really liked that idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1120.473s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I guess across the board, and this is sort of the equity piece that I'm talking about folding into each of the goals is how is this information being conveyed<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1131.022s">[McLaughlin]</a>: and relate to folks that might not typically get the news or the information and how, you know, how is, whether it's through translation or interpretation or access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1142.267s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So for any of the goals that we're thinking about, I would, I would ask my colleagues to be considering equity as an underlying aspect of those goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1152.132s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so I would make a motion that maybe in tonight's meeting, we can set the number of goals that would like to consider<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1159.301s">[McLaughlin]</a>: and perhaps a timeline by which to one, name those goals and two, evaluate those goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1174.333s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, so the motion is for tonight's meeting to identify the number of goals that we'll create for the school committee and the date at which the goals will be identified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1188.378s">[McLaughlin]</a>: and then the term in which the goals will be accomplished slash evaluated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1221.217s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I guess to that end, I would recommend maybe between two to three goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1226.021s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I guess I might say three goals, but I'd be open to my colleagues' suggestions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1337.333s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, I think I hear the concern regarding that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1340.974s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think on one hand there needs to be enough time to reasonably define the goals and enough time to achieve them and enough time to evaluate them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1353.677s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I do think the 11 month process makes sense, especially starting now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1357.418s">[McLaughlin]</a>: This is something that we've been talking about over a few meetings in terms of setting the goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1361.34s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I think that we could define<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1363.523s">[McLaughlin]</a>: a process by which, you know, this, these goals are our first set of annual goals, if you will, are evaluated and that, and then for the January term, potentially let the new school committee decide what their calendar would be for their goals, whether they want to, you know, have end of February to end of February, the following year, since the two year terms are very different and there'll be consistent over that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1390.958s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But I would, I would,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1393.507s">[McLaughlin]</a>: lean towards having the 11 months to be able to really meaningful meaningfully address the goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1561.65s">[McLaughlin]</a>: to the superintendent's point, that was what I was going to suggest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1564.211s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I don't think that a new committee should evaluate the old or the previous committees work, especially with new members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1569.934s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I would do, I would recommend a calendar year, January to December.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1573.775s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I do like the idea of quarterly, even quarterly, frankly, check-ins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1578.197s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So, you know, mid-year, you know, you know, semi-annually is fine, but I think even quarterly, so that we're, you know, at least having once on the agenda of goals, and it could be under good of the order or whatever, you know, just that we are doing a check-in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1591.965s">[McLaughlin]</a>: to see where we are at is a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1594.406s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think calendar year would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1637.61s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1920.021s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'd like to make a motion that we set three goals for the term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1982.947s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Sound great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1984.108s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I was just going to ask if we could get a list of the proposed goals from tonight so that we can all have a opportunity to look through them and consider them for the three and then if there's you know ones that anyone wants to add or flesh out they can and then it um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=2002.084s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Do folks feel like the next meeting is reasonable for the next opportunity to decide on those, or?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=2027.76s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=2028.877s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=2029.797s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then we just need to decide finally on an evaluation process for that, for the goals in November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=2036.38s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So we said we'd discuss November, have a discussion in December, but I think we need to establish some sort of process by which we're evaluating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=2062.151s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=2068.437s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=806.837s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Can you zoom back out again so I can see it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=808.698s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm sorry, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=809.958s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=812.139s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, I mean, just having worked with a number of folks who have been through this process, and it's just so abstract, as I'm sure you can imagine, particularly with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=824.103s">[McLaughlin]</a>: social media, it can be really, you know, tricky.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=828.266s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think that the way the, what I've seen and experienced is the way that these things get handled, you know, sometimes well, and sometimes maybe it could have been done better is through reporting from usually, you know, the victim or the victim's family, particularly around things that are outside of school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=851.941s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And it is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=854.557s">[McLaughlin]</a>: In my opinion, and was the intent of the law, in my opinion, that this is addressed in and outside of school, particularly because, oh my God, I'm forgetting Phoebe's name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=864.36s">[McLaughlin]</a>: What was Phoebe?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=865.401s">[McLaughlin]</a>: You know, the girl from Hopkinton that a lot of this law was created by, if anybody remembers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=870.602s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Phoebe Prince, South Hadley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=871.742s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=872.463s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, South Hadley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=873.203s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you, Phoebe Prince, that so much of this law was created for her, you know, that that was the problem is that she was, you know, obviously, one of the problems is that she was being bullied 24 seven, you know, through all kinds of, you know, means.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=886.506s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so I think that that was one of the reasons that it was addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=888.647s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But I think that, in my opinion, one of the things is that families need families and students and obviously staff need to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=897.729s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Educated and informed around this to understand that that is the policy and that it can and should be reported outside of school, you know, in you I think you had an example of what about if they're at summer camp and they have a bullying situation do we get the call and go to work to deal with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=912.576s">[McLaughlin]</a>: In the middle of July, when the students aren't even available to us for interactions, I would say yes, I mean I think that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=917.763s">[McLaughlin]</a>: we have to figure out some of that, well, particularly maybe when it, I would defer to Maurice about, you know, whether it's, you know, that summer and we're convening people to deal with it over the summer, or if we're getting the notification and we're making a plan for when the students are returning in September, I'm not really sure, but the notification I would think can and should happen in July.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=935.017s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so there needs to be a process for that because it does extend to outside of our school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=940.762s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So that's my two cents, thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1189.918s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It is up again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1190.398s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Okay, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1192.799s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I guess first I wanted to ask, you know, if Howard's here or whether, you know, Howard is going to be here at some point for things, because I think that we could, you know, I mean, I think that's part of what the law is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1204.104s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's always so debatable and whether we're interpreting the law the correct way for this and all of those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1210.107s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think it makes these, a lot of these things really sort of ambiguous and I'm not sure that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1216.491s">[McLaughlin]</a>: it's really our role to try to figure some of it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1218.973s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so that's a little bit concerning for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1220.754s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then the other concern is just as an example that you had member Rizzo a few minutes ago about, you know, and I know you said that, you know, sort of the fringe moving from one school to another, you know, one, you know, middle school to high school or something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1234.743s">[McLaughlin]</a>: is sort of outside of the scope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1235.824s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I would actually beg to differ.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1237.125s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I mean, we actually had a personal experience that I will share that, you know, where there was some middle school bullying and, you know, we're encouraged, this was a long time ago, so I don't want people to think that it's anybody that is currently within our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1249.392s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But we were encouraged to not file a report, and instead to allow, you know, administration to notify each other of the situation so that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1259.184s">[McLaughlin]</a>: know incoming administration would be aware to keep an eye out to make sure that this wasn't happening at you know another school or what have you and that's part of the problem is that if there's not and it didn't happen but that's part of the problem is if there's not communication between one school to another when kids are transitioning that can be terribly problematic so I don't know that that was necessarily a good example and I'm just saying that for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1281.942s">[McLaughlin]</a>: edification really of the public, I guess, in terms of how these can be really tricky.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1287.987s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think our role here, if I understand correctly, is that we want to try to be clear and succinct with what our policy is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1295.852s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think that there also has to be some legal review or something of it, because I don't think that we are in a position to interpret the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1412.694s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, thanks know to be clear that's not what I'm suggesting, but I am suggesting that I would like to keep draft of the document with all edits recorded and you know maybe we're doing save as so we have versions or something but my concern is because we don't know, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1427.894s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I mean, I'm sure that there are some things here that are pretty obvious, whether if there's repeated information, it's pretty clear it doesn't need to be repeated, those sorts of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1436.181s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But if there are things that we are making a decision that, oh, we think we can omit, but we don't, in fact, really know that, then how do we really know that is what I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1444.408s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I guess I would say agreed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1447.391s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think there's work that we can do here before it goes to an attorney.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1451.454s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I also think that we need to keep<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=1454.977s">[McLaughlin]</a>: versions and records of what our edits were so that it is really clear or just keep again the comments and the strikeouts and what have you if we want to do that, but to be clear, so that whoever is looking at it can see what the process and what some of the work was because I think that there may be instances where we could, and this is why I think an attorney needs to look at it primarily, where we could be thinking we're doing something that is appropriate when we're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2378.328s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2379.635s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, no, I just wanted to add for the for the presentation on the ninth, it is the Federation for children with special needs that is doing it full disclosure I work for them I don't do the presentation, I just know about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2392.527s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But it's also contracted through DC, so the Federation is contracted to Department of Education to provide this training so it's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2399.994s">[McLaughlin]</a>: specific to just children with disabilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2403.237s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's not specific to just families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2405.119s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's also caregivers, guardians, foster families, and staff and others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2412.405s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think it's a really good opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2414.287s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's virtual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2416.129s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We will see if it can be recorded potentially for people if they need the link shared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2420.072s">[McLaughlin]</a>: If they're not able to make it, there's a registration link that I did share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2423.335s">[McLaughlin]</a>: and a flyer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2423.916s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I know CPAC and the district are working together to get this flyer out to the community and the superintendent will be getting information out as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2432.342s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2433.683s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But I do think that there's so many nuances and so many pieces that are really tricky.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2438.967s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And as Maurice was just saying a moment ago, I was actually talking with somebody just last week specifically about the child pornography issue, because it's not just<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2449.196s">[McLaughlin]</a>: an issue for the person that creates it if somebody forwards that image they're, they're considered complicit, I mean, it gets really messy and can get really troubling with law enforcement I'm on the, I'm also on the board of an organization called mass kids which is about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2464.517s">[McLaughlin]</a>: child abuse prevention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2465.598s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I know some of those things around that and it just can get really messy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2469.681s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so I think training for everybody is a really, really, really good point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2474.824s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And hopefully people will come on the night that it won't be the only training that exists, but I just, I would second Dr. Ebay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2791.543s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I do, I think it's, you know, like FBI speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2797.804s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think it's just, you know, writing images on video data or intelligence of any nature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2801.445s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So intelligence could be like old style notes, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2804.665s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Like anything that sort of is, that is evidence of bullying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2825.742s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Or evidence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2826.763s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I would say evidence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2827.703s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Data or evidence of any nature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2854.51s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think we could probably lose facsimile, but that's just me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2860.313s">[McLaughlin]</a>: That's after social media.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2991.157s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think I would agree with that, Member Ruseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=2993.898s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think that we all have ideas on ways to do that, and I think I know that Member Graham offered to sort of take a pass at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3003.381s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think that's a very good idea, not to have everybody doing this, but if Member Graham, because I know you like to organize things, if she's willing, as she had said earlier, taking a pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3014.605s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I would just recommend, I mean, I'm sure you know how to clean up documents as I'm sure we all do, but I would also just recommend like the subheadings right making it really clear, you know, all the ways that we learned, you know, to write, what have you but, and I would also add and I know that I have talked to Dr. Cushing in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3034.268s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3034.488s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Bowen about this, and I believe there is hopefully an iteration of it that we can include at some point, a visual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3041.931s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So there will be a visual for those who don't learn, who are neurodiverse potentially and don't learn with all of the text and the subheadings and the bullets and all those fun things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3052.215s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Anyway, that will have something that we can distill hopefully visually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3123.418s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3123.839s">[McLaughlin]</a>: You saw my tiny little hand raised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3125.36s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Sorry, I didn't actually do the hand raise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3126.981s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you, member Rousseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3128.723s">[McLaughlin]</a>: No, I'm backing up a little bit as we're looking at this though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3131.165s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I'm asking, is there adoption of a bullying prevention curriculum?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3137.53s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So probably about-<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3171.2s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And we can ask someone from the team in a second, if you don't mind, but I'm assuming that the, or maybe I shouldn't assume, are those HECAT meetings public or are their notes, they're not public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3184.369s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Are there minutes coming out of them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3185.55s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Like how, yeah, that's interesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3187.651s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Cause how are we getting, will there be reporting out of that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3192.114s">[McLaughlin]</a>: How?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3192.394s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Oh yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3193.155s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3193.495s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3196.017s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3196.317s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I'll check in with,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3198.288s">[McLaughlin]</a>: maybe with Dr. Cushing in terms of what the schedule is, and I'd like to know sort of, you know, some of the agenda items as well, because I think it's important to know that that's on there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3206.154s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I guess I didn't realize that bullying prevention curriculum was gonna be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3225.772s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And just for the edification of, again, the public watching our folks that are on here that don't know what the HECAT is, Peter, would you mind, through the chair, Member Ruseau, if Dr. Cushing could just... It's the Health Education Curriculum Analysis Tool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3242.385s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so a committee has been convened to, or not a committee, a group has been convened based on applications that were<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3250.827s">[McLaughlin]</a>: submitted and chosen to review that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3256.068s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3386.353s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I would agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3387.154s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think that, you know, that it's providing the bullying prevention curriculum and bystander training.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3393.08s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then I would, you know, I would go, I would also suggest that that would not, would be to staff and families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3541.428s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member Ruseau, may I?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3542.949s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, I just wanted to say thank you for this, and I know that Dr. Cushion and Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3547.812s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Bowen worked on this, and I really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3549.453s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I do think that there's some things, and we don't have to get into it now, I'm happy to, you know, if you're interested, Dr. Edouard-Vincent or Dr. Cushion, give some support, lend some support around some visuals that could support this, PEX images, picture exchange images that I know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3568.357s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3568.557s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Bowen is familiar with as well, but also just fonts that are accessible, font sizes that are accessible, and sort of some of the, I don't know, I like straight lines, that's just me, but that's sort of a straight line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3583.935s">[McLaughlin]</a>: You know, just some of the aesthetic of it, but I think that there's some ways that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3587.759s">[McLaughlin]</a>: there could be one or two iterations of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3589.72s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So would love to give, you know, feedback if you're interested, but I think that this is really important and I think it really... Always happy to take feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3597.764s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you, Dr. Cushman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3671.562s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, I'm happy to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3673.244s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member Ruseau member Graham and then bring it back for another subcommittee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3925.331s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I like that idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3926.092s">[McLaughlin]</a>: No, I think that makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3929.413s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member Ruseau?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3933.374s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Is Miss Brownlee done?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3940.491s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3941.811s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So also I wanted to mention, and it's something for, it's really food for thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3946.452s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's, I don't know that it's for right now, but we do need to think about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3950.033s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so maybe it's something that we're putting in our notes or what have you that, you know, it needs to be explicit that, you know, this is not, you know, and I know it says in one sentence here, but it does not say sort of procedurally what that means, but that, you know, there can be bullying<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3965.756s">[McLaughlin]</a>: by staff, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3967.438s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Or by teachers or by guidance Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3971.16s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Some of the people that were saying it needs to be reported to immediately is his or her, blah, blah, blah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3977.204s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And what if in one of those instances, that is the person, so that they're feeling that they're being bullied again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3983.468s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I think we have to think about how we state that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3988.771s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And maybe it's after this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3990.272s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=3991.593s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I just want to put that in the parking lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4186.632s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4187.092s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I would agree with that, that there should be some response timeline at least.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4191.473s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But I also would imagine that there's going to be some legal timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4197.414s">[McLaughlin]</a>: No?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4459.607s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, I was just going to share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4460.528s">[McLaughlin]</a>: There's also an excellent local plan checklist to make sure that your local plan is required.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4469.633s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It has all the content of what is required by law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4473.235s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so we can use that, I would think, at a next meeting or when we're getting closer or at some point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4479.659s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But it's a pretty good checklist of whether these things are part of our plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4576.54s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's required to be part of the plan, Member Ruseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4732.347s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I would agree that we can have a resources section and it can say for resources, please go to the webpage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4739.868s">[McLaughlin]</a>: If you need printed resources, please contact someone for folks who may have this in a print form and are not able to go to the webpage, that might be an option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4750.31s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4752.556s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4752.756s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Bowen had something in the chat, member Rousseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4859.25s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think a comparison is a good idea I prefer this, then the, you know, then the narrative paragraphs I think this is the point of what we were making earlier about having subheadings and bulleting and what have you so it looks like somebody, or maybe they copied it from somewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4876.837s">[McLaughlin]</a>: had a similar idea to make it more palatable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=4879.278s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I just think, yeah, it would be a good practice to compare to make sure that there's not one that has something that the other doesn't, with the ultimate goal of eliminating the repeat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5016.468s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Well I would like to say iterations of the of the work is what we were talking about at the beginning of the meeting as well so I would like you to do a save as for this document today's date for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5036.067s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Okay, but then mark this as the date for that iteration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5039.75s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And if, you know, you want to download it, so make sure that Google doesn't, you know, something doesn't happen with Google and whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5046.456s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So download a copy where it has the today's date, where it's named with today's date for this iteration, instead of just relying on the Google version.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5054.808s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think would be helpful so that we don't, at the risk of a technical snafu, we can still document what's been done and backtrack if we have a question or we need to verify that what we intended actually is what we ended up with so that we're all on the same page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5074.683s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think it would be helpful to have that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5076.064s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I would suggest that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5077.818s">[McLaughlin]</a>: You know that's fine if you got if we come with it with the edited version for next time but that we have something to compare it with today's if we need to go back and say that's not quite how I remember that I'd like to look at it and not take up until we can, we can, we can immediately just go back to any version like this is the one we started with today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5094.748s">[McLaughlin]</a>: No, I know, I understand how, I know, I'm sorry, Member Ruseau, I understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5102.696s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Okay, then you can download it and send it in an attachment to me and I'll keep it in a file for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5108.141s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Oh, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5108.982s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5109.623s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, I can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5110.524s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yep, that would be fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5111.625s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then there was something else I was gonna ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5114.508s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Hmm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5119.463s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Oh yeah, and is there a timeline for us to be completing this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5125.307s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5127.609s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I wish I was kidding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5128.869s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I know, no, seriously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5151.927s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Well, we're having the bullying thing is next week on the ninth from seven to nine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5156.949s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think it would be good to have that and then come back to the table, frankly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5161.61s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I would say, you know, I would prefer two weeks so that we have the time to digest what's being shared with us from a training perspective from, you know, Desi and folks to make sure that we're sort of maybe getting some education and edification ourselves before coming back to the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5175.475s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But I think that we could have, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5177.65s">[McLaughlin]</a>: time to do the things that we asked committee members to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5183.473s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And, you know, time for community members and staff and others to sort of take another read through, you know, give some thought to the things that, you know, they might want to be thinking about and or looking at timelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5195.178s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then I guess I would like to say, I would hope that it's not too ambitious to have at least a working document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5205.482s">[McLaughlin]</a>: You know, what are we in a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5206.831s">[McLaughlin]</a>: in March.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5208.192s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think we need to have a working document, especially for things that are pretty egregious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5213.234s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I would say I think it's reasonable to put a working document together within a two-month deadline with the understanding that the work could be evolving, but we at least need to have something that can be presentable to the community, I would think, before the end of the school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5253.432s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm not, I have a big project on the 15th and we have to do a run through at four o'clock on that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5258.574s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I am free if we wanna do, if you guys can do like a six o'clock, I could not do the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5304.177s">[McLaughlin]</a>: As is the transition fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5305.518s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Transition fair, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5364.678s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes, in collaboration with Dr. Cushing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5401.242s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, I thought Memogram was going to just take a look at sort of trying to make it more palatable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5406.204s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I didn't know if it was like with subheadings or bulleting things that are already there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5410.726s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, or.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5426.983s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5427.963s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5428.383s">[McLaughlin]</a>: If there's whole sections that we can eliminate because they're repeats or whatever, that makes sense not to try to be structuring them, but just in the long, in the big picture, obviously there needs to be a structure and style.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5477.318s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then may I make a recommendation, Superintendent, that Howard gets a heads up that we're doing this stuff<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5508.442s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, and if not attend, at least have some time for, you know, review or a synopsis or something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/goLe37yQgNQ&t=5543.154s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I thought you said you were gonna do that, members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=428.832s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I have a point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=430.072s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's my middle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=431.132s">[McLaughlin]</a>: McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=432.233s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I'm assuming that the comments on the right are from Attorney Greenspan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=437.534s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=438.514s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=438.734s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Because they yeah, just the Katie me any LT is a little.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=442.621s">[McLaughlin]</a>: confusing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=443.161s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So just want to make sure that folks know that the comments on the right are from attorney.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=447.625s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=612.037s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=612.618s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, I think it needs to be parsed out a little bit because it's a little confusing in terms of the way I'm looking at it so if I understand it correctly, an anonymous complaint of bullying or retaliation will not result in disciplinary action taken against a student, obviously until<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=629.196s">[McLaughlin]</a>: an investigation is made, I would assume it says solely on the best on the basis of an anonymous report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=635.44s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So in other words, they're not going to take disciplinary action against a student, for example, suspending a student solely on the basis of an anonymous report, but I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=647.092s">[McLaughlin]</a>: should there be an investigation based on an anonymous report and the investigation shows that there was, you know, reasonable cause for bullying or whatever, that then disciplinary action should be taken, can be taken even against the student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=660.904s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I think this whole thing is a little bit confusing and I just want both Howard to clarify because obviously I think if there's a staff member<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=671.148s">[McLaughlin]</a>: disciplinary action can be taken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=673.009s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But again, I would assume it wouldn't be based solely on an anonymous report, which says solely on the basis of an anonymous report, that there would be an investigation to determine that the anonymous report was accurate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=685.298s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Because obviously, anonymous reports, you know, could just be somebody, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=691.722s">[McLaughlin]</a>: you know, creating a hoax or something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=694.283s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I guess it's just a little bit unclear to me, and I think maybe instead of having it be like three sentences right now, which is essentially what it is in one sentence, that we might want to just break it down into individual sentences or something, because I'm not really understanding what you guys are saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=713.169s">[McLaughlin]</a>: In terms of how, I'm sorry, just to clarify, in terms of how it applies to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=718.497s">[McLaughlin]</a>: a student but not a staff member or a staff member but not a student based solely on the basis of an anonymous report, which I think anything based solely on the basis of anonymous report, disciplinary action wouldn't be taken because it couldn't be unless it was confirmed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=805.743s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Exactly, based solely on an anonymous report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=807.824s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's the solely, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=809.184s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So that was the piece that I'm talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=878.867s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=879.267s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I don't think that's the impression that we've had, Howard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=882.488s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so I guess maybe that begs the question if you're saying that that is what is required.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=888.23s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think that according to what I saw in the DESE bullying standards, it can be a student or a staff member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=895.532s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I don't think it can be a parent or community member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=898.473s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think you're right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=899.353s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think outside of the school is a different issue, although there's some gray areas around social media and that sort of thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=907.315s">[McLaughlin]</a>: particularly with student and staff members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=908.936s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I would agree with you that I don't think it could be a parent, caregiver, or community member, but the student and staff member, I think it can be based on what I've seen in terms of my own research on DESE and bullying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=924.404s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I would say, yeah, includes staff members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1086.779s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1088.659s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think that that's, you know, respectfully, Howard, I think that parents and caregivers and even community members can file a report of bullying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1097.382s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think that, you know, Joan, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1099.842s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Bowen will have some background on this and maybe Dr. Cushing as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1106.304s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But I think that they can, in fact, in fact, I know that they have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1113.751s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And that they are required to be investigated because there's going to be sometimes student sometimes you can imagine all kinds of scenarios where a student may be getting bullied and not want to file a complaint and the parent does right and because it's you know an important issue and what have you so there's a whole bunch of nuance around this, but I do think that we're confusing two issues and I guess this is what.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1134.081s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I want to parse out a little bit for folks so that we're not right now, we went from talking about anonymous reports to a whole other subject.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1142.788s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I guess I'd like to, you know, finish up the anonymous report question comment, which I think the whole issue is that this is accurate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1154.717s">[McLaughlin]</a>: based solely, you know, solely on the basis of anonymous report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1158.3s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So, you know, that they can't be disciplined based solely on an anonymous report, which I would agree with, and I think is accurate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1166.768s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I don't know the question of whether a parent, caregiver, or community member can be disciplined by the school or anything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1172.974s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Any other action can be taken against this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1174.955s">[McLaughlin]</a>: them on the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1176.156s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And that's where the nuance around parent, caregiver or community member came in for me, not about whether or not they can file a bullying report, because I believe that they can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1186.882s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I think we're like mixing up a couple of issues here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1189.603s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I would respectfully ask that maybe we break them down and, you know, finish one before we potentially start another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1245.23s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm not sure what you're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1246.511s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Are you talking about an anonymous report or an other report?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1249.953s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm not sure what you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1264.143s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Well, if I'm not mistaken, it's on the website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1266.464s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Well, it's on the website, if I'm not mistaken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1268.305s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's not just... Yeah, you're right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1272.307s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1272.728s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So in any case, I guess what I'm saying is, what are we talking about right here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1276.27s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Because I'm not talking about a student going to a business and something happening there, which obviously is another issue and is a whole other nuance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1285.015s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think that we could get into all of these various conversations and throw a million different scenarios in the pot and you know go go down that road and I don't think anybody has the time for that I think what I'm trying to say is that okay for the anonymous report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1298.008s">[McLaughlin]</a>: You know, I believe Howard attorney Greenspan is going to check on the parent caregiver or community member issue which I don't think can be included there personally because the school is not going to take disciplinary action against parent care giver or community members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1311.722s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1312.683s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Number two, I think the other issue around whether you know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1317.873s">[McLaughlin]</a>: caregivers, or community members for that matter, can file a bullying report, which is different than an anonymous report, which frankly they can based on the website, but a bullying report is another question altogether.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1329.856s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Certainly I know parent caregivers are, potentially community members can too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1333.357s">[McLaughlin]</a>: What happens if you have a kid in DCF custody who's only confiding in their parish member?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1338.699s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1339.16s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And they're being bullied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1340.241s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I mean, I would assume they would go to a staff member and have that worked out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1342.844s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But but we don't necessarily know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1344.305s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I think, again, that's probably a question for Attorney Greenspan to answer in terms of who can file a bullying report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1351.693s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But I just want to say for folks watching and others, I you know, and certainly they can look on Desi's website themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1358.06s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1358.84s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I firmly believe that parent caregivers can and in fact have so and I would defer to Dr. Cushing and Joan Bowen and the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1606.147s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1606.768s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Just what is, how are we going to make sure that that is happening?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1609.85s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I think it needs to be built into the school calendar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1682.8s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Do we need to make a motion or do we just want to say yes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1689.303s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Then I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1706.226s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member Musso, can you just hover over that item so we can see the comment open?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1711.788s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, because we don't know which one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1712.908s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1861.376s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1861.797s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I mean, I think this gets back to the incident report issue that we've been talking about for some time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1865.979s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so I agree that all should be taken out, but I think that we need to think about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1871.318s">[McLaughlin]</a>: if they're documenting incidences of unacceptable student behavior and treating these instances with standard school disciplinary procedures, then I would say, one, parent caregivers need to be notified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1884.589s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And two, with the understanding that there are unique legal requirements and procedures for students with disabilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1927.231s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But I actually no, I disagree because I think that it needs to be we talk about communication all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1933.534s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think that yes, while those other policies are there, that's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1936.935s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But people who are reading these may not know that those other policies are there, whether their parents or caregivers or anybody else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1942.638s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I think it's really important that we reiterate things throughout our district in terms of policies and procedures and that folks are aware of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1951.923s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1952.684s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I would actually disagree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1953.605s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think that there should be either if it's separate bullet items for, you know, how the incident reports are handled and or a separate bullet item for, you know, understanding legal procedure around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1967.86s">[McLaughlin]</a>: students with disability and manifestation of disability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1970.864s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then I would also say, I mean, I would go back to the to the unacceptable point I mean I hear what you're saying but I think it is a value statement and I get, you know, student some student behavior is unacceptable some student behavior is, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1983.118s">[McLaughlin]</a>: anything else, but if we're trying to think about student strength based language, you know, we can just say during documenting incidences of student behavior and treating these incidents with standard school disciplinary procedures as needed or something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=1996.08s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So that we're, you know, I think that putting a value statement on things is not necessarily helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2001.101s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And if we want to be strength based as a district, I think we should be reconsidering those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2004.942s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So two items I have there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2006.362s">[McLaughlin]</a>: One is, you know, two distinct bullet items around, you know, or included in this bullet item, I don't care around<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2012.955s">[McLaughlin]</a>: You know incident report incidents, you know documentation of incidents are shared with you know caregivers and.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2021.325s">[McLaughlin]</a>: There is an understanding that there are unique procedures and policies for students with disabilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2028.089s">[McLaughlin]</a>: so that people can cross-reference that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2029.73s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And for more information or something, go here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2032.552s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But I think, again, some family members, caregivers who are invested in looking at the bullying policy might not know about the special education students with disabilities laws and policies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2043.78s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so having that reiterated, I think is important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2480.199s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes, I couldn't agree more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2481.38s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think we need to get to the attorney comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2483.141s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I do want to note for the record that there are different and very disciplinary procedures for students with disabilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2489.425s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I would like a link there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2491.526s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then I would also say we still haven't addressed the issue of incident reports to caregivers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2497.59s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So we need to think about that at some point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2509.238s">[McLaughlin]</a>: links for the disability, the protocol for students with disabilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2514.041s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, I can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2514.941s">[McLaughlin]</a>: There's not a link for an incident report because we've talked about this on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2518.463s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So that's a separate issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2520.124s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But the disability one, sure, Joan or I can get that to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2524.706s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2886.144s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Again, I think just using the same as you know what we've done in the previous section in terms of the value language and the and the all but I think that it also begs the question again I mean I'm seeing incident 1234 times on this page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2902.873s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think we have to put somewhere in here where the incident reports are going for family and community engagement as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2910.236s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I am making a motion that we include a segment on incident report, any incident reports created are also shared with caregivers and family members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2927.785s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, we already had it and we already agreed on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2929.866s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I'm just saying that if we're going to, I'm wondering where we're putting it because we haven't done that yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2977.007s">[McLaughlin]</a>: No, I think it was said we need to review that policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2979.749s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I guess I would ask that we look at that policy at the next bullying meeting that we have on this policy because the issue is and the issue that was on the floor is that we've had families historically that have not been made aware of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2991.579s">[McLaughlin]</a>: behavior incidents and then students potentially are getting suspended or disciplined or whatever else and student and families and caregivers are not aware of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=2998.883s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I believe we already decided on the floor that this was going to be something that we did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3003.646s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I mean, we can clarify when we come back to report out on this meeting with the other members of the committee if we'd like to where that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3012.622s">[McLaughlin]</a>: information should be, but I think it's important that the incident report information is in the bullying context, because we're now asking families to go to multiple different places to understand these policies, where on one hand, I understand what you guys are saying about wanting to narrow down the scope and making sure that it's simple and understandable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3031.899s">[McLaughlin]</a>: On the other hand, we're putting the burden on parents and families to find out<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3035.662s">[McLaughlin]</a>: the other information that accompanies this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3037.483s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So whether it's a link, that's fine, but I don't want to wait another, you know, till again, September, October, whatever, till we're dealing with the incident report, because it is intrinsically connected to the bullying report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3049.348s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I would ask that it be included in the next meeting that we have on this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3072.384s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Right, not right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3073.445s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3073.905s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3074.546s">[McLaughlin]</a>: That's what I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3075.146s">[McLaughlin]</a>: When we report out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3085.875s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Right, which we can do at the next meeting and have it combined with the bullying meeting for the next RPI meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3098.117s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'll just do it at the next school committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3100.0s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3431.251s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3432.832s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Also, it's IEP or 504.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3437.633s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm not sure where you're going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3444.936s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Okay, so I believe it's IEP or 504.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3449.575s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I agree with Howard that it is 10 days but Howard it's 10 days and or a pattern of removal so it's not some people think it's 10 consecutive days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3464.925s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It can be 10 days or a pattern of removal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3469.348s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So what some administrators do, and I'm not saying in this district, but sometimes what we see administrators might do is suspend a student for less than the 10 days and or do partial dismissal so that they're sort of underneath this law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3487.737s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I think that, again, this needs a link.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3491.139s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I would also defer to Joan on the link and the specifics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3493.519s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It does get very nuanced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3496.24s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think that they should be, you know, somebody else needs to be involved that understands this better, whether it's the director of student services or the attorney or somebody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3508.842s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But I would definitely say add 504 and then nuance around the move from school for more than 10 days, because it's a little bit more than just that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3558.513s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3558.933s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Remember Ruseau point of information, but there's no appeals process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3562.715s">[McLaughlin]</a>: That's true, Howard, but there is, there are other procedural safeguards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3567.636s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So there is potentially the office of civil rights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3569.937s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I just want to be really clear that like, if people feel so Joan, I would ask that you maybe we have Joan answer some of this too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3587.108s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So number 10 says notify the aggressor of his or her rights in the process to appeal your decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3593.133s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So Howard saying that there's not a process to appeal the decision regarding what the school district decides on bullying, but there are other procedural safeguards such as the office for civil rights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3640.36s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Oh, okay, I misunderstood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3641.842s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm sorry, I was misunderstanding, Member Ruseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3645.165s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I was thinking that this was saying that there was a finding of no bullying and the aggressor and the individual can be notified of their rights and that they could appeal if they wanted to, meaning the individual that made the bullying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3658.678s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so I guess it also begs the question, what happens if,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3662.196s">[McLaughlin]</a>: There is no, and do we have that farther down or Howard, can you respond to that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3666.458s">[McLaughlin]</a>: What if there's a finding of no bullying?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3668.639s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Because I believe that there's also no appeal process for that in terms of the school district, but there is other procedural safeguards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3676.182s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So that was the sort of nuance that I was trying to tease out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3723.49s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, no, civil rights is the federal government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3725.271s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But the point is, is that we can do a link there then, because if you want, because I'm just saying from Joan's perspective too, that there are procedural safeguards and we do have to notify families of procedural safeguards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3736.379s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So if there's a bullying incident that does involve a student with a disability, for example, and the bullying decision has been found unfounded,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3747.667s">[McLaughlin]</a>: in the district by the district personnel to say that there's no appeal is not accurate for students with disabilities, because there is, there are procedural safeguards, which include the Office of Civil Rights or ERS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3761.111s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I think that it's getting, I don't know, Howard, I would defer to you and looking, maybe talking with some of the, you know, too many Hesse and Lehane folks and see, but I think it could be really nuanced there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3781.7s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So maybe Joan, if you would, through member Ruseau, if through the chair, if we can have the director of pupil services reach out to our special education representatives to clarify this question or issue, I would ask that so that we're clear that if we're telling people that there's no right to appeal their decision, that we need to be accountable for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3818.215s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I understand, but we are going to have to, I think, address the other stuff as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3821.658s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so that's why I'm bringing it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3823.339s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I understand that this is for the aggressor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3825.541s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I get that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3826.842s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so the other issue is that if the decision is found not bullying, then what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3831.926s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Because we haven't put that in here, number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3833.768s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then number two is, what does that actually mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3836.59s">[McLaughlin]</a>: If there's no appeal, what are there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3838.371s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so I think that those are the two issues that I'm<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3841.857s">[McLaughlin]</a>: trying to respond to, because if we're saying we're notifying the aggressor of his or her rights in the process to appeal the decision, we are also at some point notifying if we find no bullying, we're notifying the families that no bullying was found, and we have to tell them what that process is after that, if there is one or not, in my opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3870.593s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Okay, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3872.434s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But I'm just saying that if it's as it relates to the appeal, I want to look at that when we're looking at it two pages down specific to the no bullying, because it is it's very legally complicated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=3885.961s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think, you know, has he to me and Lehane do need to look at this to some degree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=4596.621s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I just was going to say, I concur with member Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=4599.863s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think it's important that we lay out a process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=4778.713s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Can we just look at that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=4779.694s">[McLaughlin]</a>: What did it say?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=4787.724s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=4788.344s">[McLaughlin]</a>: You might just want to put slash program quality assurance because people see it as both.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=4792.369s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then I would just recommend the PRS in parentheses and PQA in parentheses just so folks know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=4806.413s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So this just to that just to that point this is similar to the appeals process, what I was discussing earlier so just to remember grams point earlier so this is an example, so seeking assistance outside of the district you may do so through PRS this is what we were asking that be put in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=4821.9s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I was asking to be sure that it was put in PRS and or OCR, which is the Office of Civil Rights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=4828.324s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And that is the procedural safeguards that we were talking about earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=4832.026s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So we have part of it in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=4834.028s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I would ask that we add the civil rights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=4837.39s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And also people are talking about students on IEPs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=4839.631s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But again, students with disabilities are not just students on IEPs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=4843.733s">[McLaughlin]</a>: There are students that have disabilities that don't have IEPs or 504s.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=4848.496s">[McLaughlin]</a>: There are students who have disabilities that are on 504s.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=4851.417s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I think we need to be clear, like we can't say that just because a student has an IEP, there aren't students with disabilities that don't have IEPs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Y0_Ezb06bvc&t=4859.479s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I think we might just want to say students with disabilities and get rid of IEP and 504 altogether, because I think that that is confusing and not everybody that has a disability has an IEP or 504.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=46.919s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's 5.02.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=47.259s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We'll get started in a moment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=48.681s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Just want to make sure I don't see Sharon on here yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=123.495s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=123.956s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Okay, good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=126.979s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Welcome, everyone to the diversity, equity and inclusion subcommittee meeting for today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=139.877s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=141.819s">[McLaughlin]</a>: If you could mute, that would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=143.181s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=145.303s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So it's, please, I'm just gonna read our notice and then we'll get started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=218.614s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=219.455s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So member Hays.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=224.678s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=225.838s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member McLaughlin here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=226.859s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member Ruseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=229.447s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=231.389s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I know that as the superintendent said that she was in route, driving back to the high school so that might be a moment or two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=239.236s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And we were just going to get started so I was hoping the superintendent might be able to give us a little bit of background but I do see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=247.692s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Principal DeLava is on the call, so if I could ask maybe Principal DeLava if you can give us a little bit of background in terms of, you know, the changes to the student handbook and what occurred.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=710.382s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I guess I would add, oh, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=712.382s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Uh, member, um, Hayes, just a moment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=714.923s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Um, I guess I would also add if there's any, I'd be curious if there's any sort of data collection on, on, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=722.2s">[McLaughlin]</a>: you know, any student increase in, you know, either behavior referrals or requests to leave classrooms or anything like that based on any subgroup population.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=736.489s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And these new procedures, that could always be helpful to take a look at, but member Hays.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=816.65s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Principal DeLava please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=1852.118s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think data collection sounds like a good idea just in terms of ensuring, you know, again, the equity piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=1859.94s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I would be curious as to Member Hays' reflection on the data collection and sort of how you would want to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=1886.683s">[McLaughlin]</a>: No, what the data is saying, essentially, if they're going to be using more data to sort of, if the proposal is to sort of use data to sort of, to see how this is affecting the students, both with the student survey that's currently out in this informal recording that Mr. DeLave was just talking about from the MCAS and others, you know, is it a discussion that you want to have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=1909.77s">[McLaughlin]</a>: to reconvene around data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=1910.77s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I mean, I think it's a little tricky to have this discussion sort of in an ambiguous way without knowing exactly what it is we're dealing with or looking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=1921.274s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So we're saying, yeah, we want to look at this information and consider all the ways that these new procedures could impact<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=1931.036s">[McLaughlin]</a>: underrepresented populations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=1932.997s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so what is the way in which to do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=1936.46s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then how would we be able to review that once that occurs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=2046.469s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=2514.872s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Suggestions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=2516.714s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member Ruseau and then Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=2590.312s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you, Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=2823.889s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So superintendent if I understood you accurately you were saying data collection to reconvene in the fall around looking at what what the basically taking the surveys that are currently out looking at that data and potentially the teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=2846.585s">[McLaughlin]</a>: What's the word I'm looking for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=2848.506s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Roundtable, if you will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=2850.668s">[McLaughlin]</a>: You know, that as well, and having that data and coming back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=2855.411s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Were you saying to the subcommittee or were you saying to the committee as a whole to sort of give information about how this is or isn't working?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=2970.118s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=2970.999s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think it's a good start superintendent to, you know, have something to build on in September to have this conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=2978.203s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=2979.444s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I don't know how the rest of the members feel about having that conversation as a part of a agenda item on the school committee meeting as a whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=2987.568s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then, you know, from there, we can talk about whether, you know, again, to member Hays' point, whether this should be, you know, dated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=2997.414s">[McLaughlin]</a>: response or data information, particularly around, you know, a topic should be a regular thing or part of a report, as Member Ruseau was saying, or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=3007.258s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But I think just to sort of get us at a starting point, I think it would be helpful to have, you know, maybe this is an agenda item, maybe, you know, you know, in the end of September ish, so that there's time to collect data would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=3021.543s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And if the rest of the members are in agreement with that, I'd be happy to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=3027.078s">[McLaughlin]</a>: to say, that's great, and make a motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=3031.821s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So let me know what folks think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=3035.104s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thumbs up, thumbs down?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=3056.15s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, I think that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=3058.283s">[McLaughlin]</a>: to members of this point, if you are looking for a full report, then that would be something that would need to go through the policy, you know, that we've already written for a report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=3067.168s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I would recommend having it a little more ambiguous in the terms of following the superintendent's lead around having her present the data at the school committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=3077.494s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But I think, you know, you can be more specific with both the superintendent and Mr. DeLeva about some of the data points you are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=3087.0s">[McLaughlin]</a>: maybe specifically looking for, so that it'll be an informed presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=3092.101s">[McLaughlin]</a>: That's always something that's just good practice for what you want for the presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=3096.562s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then from that point, you know, after the presentation, if you feel like, you know, if the committee or other members obviously have the prerogative to, you know, feel like they want additional information or they think this should be a regular report or whatever, and then you can follow the procedure from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=3111.186s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But I think because, you know, my feeling, because this is new and there's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=3117.568s">[McLaughlin]</a>: some ambiguity around it and people are still feeling their way through it, that I think it would be good to start with this first step and then see how the data is presented with a clear expectation from an email or what have you about the data that is being looked at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=3134.746s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then I think it's a matter of literally just emailing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=3139.829s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Markey to get it on the agenda for, you know, the second meeting in September, and I would leave that to the superintendent and Markey to be able to make that happen, but I have full confidence that that can happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=3178.913s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I hear you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=3179.774s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I don't think that we need to make a motion that's your prerogative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=3182.834s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I don't think we need to make a motion we can report out to the whole committee and I can do that as the chair and then I can offer you the opportunity to speak as well if you'd like, you know your prerogative and just share with the rest of the school committee that we had a discussion and we asked for some data points and the superintendent<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=3200.458s">[McLaughlin]</a>: you know, agreed that she would provide these data points at a meeting in September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=3203.802s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And if you want, you know, for the next meeting, we can ask the superintendent if perhaps you can give us that date for September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=3209.849s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm sure Markey can give us that in the meantime.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=3212.633s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And that may make things feel a little bit more concrete for you, superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=3285.433s">[McLaughlin]</a>: That works for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=3286.674s">[McLaughlin]</a>: How about you folks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=3289.18s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, okay so I'm confident with reporting that out member Hays, I don't think we need a motion to make that happen it seems like it's already happened so, and we are at 556 so I'm going to ask folks is there anything that anybody wants to add I want to thank you all for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=3304.182s">[McLaughlin]</a>: taking the time to brainstorm this a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=3305.964s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think that it needs to, you know, we'll need to massage it a little bit, we'll see what the data points look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=3310.328s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think that it's really about the conversation, as Member Hays was saying, and some of the brainstorming about how are we ensuring that this is an equitable, that we are putting in to practice equitable practice for all of our student population, and really considering the impact that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=3326.896s">[McLaughlin]</a>: significant changes can have on more of our underrepresented population.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=3331.398s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I appreciate everybody taking the time to sort of wade your way through this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=3336.661s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And thank you, Member Hays, for bringing the resolution forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=3340.142s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so we'll report this out at the next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=3343.684s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And with that, I make a motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=3348.386s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Okay, so motion to adjourn, seconded by Member Ruseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=3351.308s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Roll call, Member Hays?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=3352.868s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=3354.049s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member McLaughlin?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=3354.849s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=3355.55s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member Ruseau?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GLKeQVZxhiI&t=3358.38s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=268.444s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Do you want me to share it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=269.904s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Is it something you emailed us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=296.397s">[McLaughlin]</a>: That's OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=296.977s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so it's right here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=298.318s">[McLaughlin]</a>: What do you want, the PDF, 2023 evaluation PDF, or what are you looking for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=322.387s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=324.83s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Uh, it's just on the it should be on your right on your I mean on the bottom menu bar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=329.713s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So evaluations of committee notes, notes version 2 version 3 Superintendent evaluation guide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=335.976s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Oh, last modified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=336.716s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Let me do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=477.597s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=478.677s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I was just going to say, I think this is really helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=480.898s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I, you know, especially having the numbers being able to add up instead of trying to, you know, nuance a whole bunch of other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=487.54s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So it looks like the, so the access toward progress goals and the assessed performance on standard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=493.402s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=493.702s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So, so the access towards goals, which we can see, you know, so,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=500.154s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Obviously, the numbers speak for themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=502.355s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So, you know, some progress and significant progress, or some significant progress and met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=509.219s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then the step two, it looks like the numbers are in the proficient.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=514.641s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I know that you said you're going to marry the comments from the evaluators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=520.064s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=520.304s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, I'm going to, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=529.817s">[McLaughlin]</a>: No, I think you've done a great job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=531.298s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you for all that you have done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=532.659s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think this particular rubric and sort of seeing the visual again, I'm a visual learner, as I've said before, I think seeing the visual with the numbers and the standards is really helpful for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=545.246s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=548.308s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so the way that the numbers look, and again, we will talk about this in the larger<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=556.274s">[McLaughlin]</a>: committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=557.635s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But if I understand correctly, the way the numbers are coming out now is a is proficient.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=583.694s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And we'll see that later on page three or whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=586.376s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=587.136s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I thought your instructions were very helpful as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=589.838s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So essentially what you had said to us was go to page three, do your individual assessments based on what you think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=600.884s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then you're taking those individual assessments and assigning the number of significant progress met or exceeded based on various committee members input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=612.967s">[McLaughlin]</a>: and then the same with the standards that we all agreed upon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=621.355s">[McLaughlin]</a>: No, I think it's been super helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=623.016s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then I think that obviously there'll be some, so that's the quantitative data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=629.09s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Right, and there'll be some qualitative data that will be brought to the table at the next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=635.114s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Um, school committee meeting, um, when we.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=638.796s">[McLaughlin]</a>: When we share this out, is that right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=685.645s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So may I?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=686.606s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=688.188s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=688.829s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So would it be helpful to have all of the narrative in one like, you know, Google Doc or something that is shared?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=699.799s">[McLaughlin]</a>: individually with us where we cannot respond to each other, so that we're not violating any public meeting rules, where we could potentially highlight comments that we feel are representative of the whole, probably as like sort of homework before the next meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=762.439s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think you mean June 1st, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=986.628s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I don't think you need a motion, but what do you think?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1009.139s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think that's the table motion to table to the next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1027.317s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, and to be clear if people are wondering, like again that are watching or whatever if they're wondering why we're not discussing, you know, the, the ratings themselves that's not the purpose of the meeting this meeting is really to as a, as a, you know, the evaluation subcommittee to really<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1046.209s">[McLaughlin]</a>: work on the process, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1047.669s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Member Hays.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1049.93s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Correct, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1076.592s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Can we get a timeline member Hays, excuse me, may I speak, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1081.375s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1081.635s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes, of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1082.275s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Can we get a timeline on when you want to get the qualitative material to us and when you'd like us to get back to you with the highlighted material before the next meeting that would be helpful just to put it in my calendar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1125.476s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Oh yeah, that's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1125.996s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We're not getting them back to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1127.016s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We're just highlighting the homework in the meantime, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1129.217s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1587.642s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1588.502s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, I just wanted to add that I think what I'm hearing too is that, you know, the evidence that's there and we are, that's part of the process that we're going through now in terms of making this process uniform using the rubric that DESI provides around evaluation, identifying in advance what the goals are, what goals and items are being evaluated,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1610.571s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And that we're using this specific rubric to do this which has not been the case in the past so that's all publicly available information that's all part of what you see here in the in the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1622.662s">[McLaughlin]</a>: in the material that we just shared, but also, you know, DESE has their superintendent rubric online, the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, and was one of the reasons that we really wanted to standardize the form and use what other people are using so that we're comparing apples to apples across districts and amongst each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1640.545s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then the other piece I think I heard you say was that, would you know what individuals reported?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1645.286s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And yes, that's part of public information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1647.966s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And we are also sharing that as part of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1651.907s">[McLaughlin]</a>: a vote that we took earlier that each of our reports are, you know, they're public anyway, but that we would all, you know, essentially be able to see or have that information that we saw individually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1663.91s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But this subcommittee is tasked with bringing all that information together under member Hays' stewardship and direction to bring all the information together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1673.952s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so that's part of why we're looking at the, you know, quantitative data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1676.913s">[McLaughlin]</a>: The numbers are a little bit easier to just sort of put together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1679.954s">[McLaughlin]</a>: The qualitative data can be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1682.634s">[McLaughlin]</a>: a little bit more time-consuming because we might have seven, you know, well, we will have seven narratives, but I suspect that a lot of them will be similar and some of them may be dissimilar, and that's sort of what we'll be charted with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1695.098s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And then I just, if I might, Member Hays, I wanted to also address the question from Jess, who, I don't know Jess's last name, but sorry, Jess, that we didn't get the name for the record, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1708.062s">[McLaughlin]</a>: to just share that part of the superintendent evaluation process should be happening throughout the year, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1714.008s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I mean we're all hearing from constituents as school committee members about what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1719.724s">[McLaughlin]</a>: their experiences are in the district what they would like to see changed or better or improved what they think is working, you know how things are sort of happening so we're seeing that throughout the year we definitely have public participation throughout the year as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1733.055s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think it's a longer conversation for the entire committee to have around, you know how and in what way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1741.422s">[McLaughlin]</a>: there'd be public participation in superintendent evaluation and also looking at what other districts are doing and what the protocol is and sort of all of those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1749.825s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And because it can also, as you can imagine, the people that show up might be the squeaky wheels and the people that don't might not be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1758.088s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So there sort of has to be a process that we all agree is equitable and is one that is consistent and one that the MASC, which is the Mass Association of School Committees,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1769.072s">[McLaughlin]</a>: and the MASS, which is the Mass Association of School Superintendents, would surely offer advice and let us know best practices around doing that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1777.954s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I think that there's always opportunity for feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1782.234s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I hope that you guys are reaching out to us to let us know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1785.755s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And also, I know that the superintendent has been receptive as well in terms of people reaching out to her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1790.736s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I would encourage that too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1792.856s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And that's part of the building relationships that we should all be working on in terms of the family and community engagement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1799.017s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I just I just sort of wanted to mention that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1811.229s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1811.789s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1812.15s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yep, it is as part of the data that's that's if I may member pays I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1816.114s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1818.128s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Absolutely, that's why we're going with a rubric.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1819.829s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So thank you, you're absolutely right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1821.21s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's shared with all the members across the board, same rubric.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1823.972s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We're all evaluating based on the items we agreed to evaluate based on the superintendent's goal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1831.077s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So we are making it much more uniform.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1832.818s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you for asking and for noticing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1835.8s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=2062.027s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I just wanted to say that I think it is good practice just as part of whenever we're, you know, orienting the community to what we're doing, you know, here's where we were, here's what we did, here's where we're going, here's what we're presenting, whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=2075.474s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I think a primer slide or, you know, one or two, you know, here's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=2079.636s">[McLaughlin]</a>: The, you know, here are the goals here the, you know, pieces that we evaluated on and here's what the evaluation wants is always good sort of just again because not everybody is necessarily accessing the website, not everybody is necessarily, you know, coming to a public meeting or watching the meetings on MCM or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=2096.982s">[McLaughlin]</a>: what have you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=2097.463s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I think it's just always good if people, you know, decide to tune in for that or if we have a record of the information is sort of this was what the process was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=2104.606s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so I think it could be really helpful to have a one-page, you know, piece and I'm happy to help work with you on that if you'd like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=2127.007s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I think you did it really already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=2128.748s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I think you did the majority of the work already in the instructions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=2134.874s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I think it would just be a matter of simplifying that on a slide or two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=2137.897s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm happy to do that and modify you guys at the next one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=2140.86s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=2141.873s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Wonderful, thanks so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=2143.333s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Sure, so I would make an emotion that we continue the meeting to June 1st for our subcommittee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=915.103s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Hello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=915.723s">[McLaughlin]</a>: How are you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=917.048s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Hi everyone, Melanie McLaughlin, Alston Street in Medford Moss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=920.691s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you for giving me a moment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=923.053s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I just wanted to comment on 2024 if I could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=927.157s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I wanted to thank Member Graham for bringing this to the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=931.16s">[McLaughlin]</a>: This is something that I worked on for a couple of years with the Universal Safety Committee and something that I had been really<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=937.586s">[McLaughlin]</a>: hoping to push forward before my resignation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=941.569s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so I think this is a really important piece and one that I want folks to consider as you're thinking about the building of the new high school as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=951.777s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So, you know, while there's a building that we hope is going to be built in the interim, there are a lot of things that are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=957.882s">[McLaughlin]</a>: out of compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, and that is the access to our building and particularly our high school is really, there's a lot that needs to be done there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=969.09s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We have applied for MOD grant in the past and have not gotten it for a number of reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=975.434s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So, can you guys hear me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=979.597s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Hello?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=982.264s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Oh, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=982.604s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I was just hearing feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=983.444s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I was just going to say that we have applied for the MOD in the past, and I think that, you know, it's something that needs to be informed, and I would recommend or ask folks if they would consider collaborating with the Disability Commission<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=1000.533s">[McLaughlin]</a>: and or members of the disability community to work on this because I think well-intentioned folks who don't have lived experience with disability can often make errors that are long lasting and I think this is something that you know is long overdue and should be addressed appropriately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=1019.233s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I would<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=1020.894s">[McLaughlin]</a>: ask the committee to please consider perhaps making an amendment to the motion to include disability advocates in the committee, I mean, in the commission, as they evaluate this process with the ADA compliance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=810.813s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=15804.237s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Rick McLaughlin, 87 West Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=15806.859s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm compelled to speak with you today for three reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=15810.402s">[McLaughlin]</a>: The first is as the father of an alumna who was in the marching band, I've seen other things, the same things that the students have already spoken about and what other parents have spoken about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=15818.268s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I'm not gonna, I'll just say yes to what they've said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=15822.691s">[McLaughlin]</a>: The second reason is I'm the son of a career music educator, taught music in public schools for 40 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=15829.457s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And he told me in the 1970s that this would happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=15832.259s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I'm going to tell you about that in a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=15833.6s">[McLaughlin]</a>: The third reason is because as a professional musician myself and professor at the most influential school of music in the world, I've seen the power of music on four continents, both as a performer and as a clinician.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=15845.227s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So my dad, he taught music in public schools for 40 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=15849.729s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I remember in the 1970s, he told me that one day what would happen is the school committee or principals or whoever was actually managing money would cut the music program enough<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=15861.656s">[McLaughlin]</a>: that it just, it wouldn't cut it completely, just enough to let it die, which is what is happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=15869.383s">[McLaughlin]</a>: You say that you're going to still support the arts, that's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=15873.727s">[McLaughlin]</a>: The impact that other people have already discussed, you should take to heart because it's very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=15880.313s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But there's another element that's very important, which is the mission of the Medford Public Schools is to provide a supportive and effective educational environment that helps students successfully meet their individualized goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=15890.283s">[McLaughlin]</a>: This will no longer be true when you cut Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=15893.025s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Ferrello's position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=15894.467s">[McLaughlin]</a>: By cutting her position, you will make it so that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=15898.03s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Future students do not sign up for music.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=15900.732s">[McLaughlin]</a>: A previous student spoke about how it's virtually impossible to do it anyway because of the ways that the scheduling conflicts prevent them from actually taking these courses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=15910.171s">[McLaughlin]</a>: M-Y-E-L-I-N, myelin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=15913.954s">[McLaughlin]</a>: That is the aspect of the brain, the neurological neuron wrapping that actually makes your brain process information more effectively and more quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=15925.063s">[McLaughlin]</a>: None of the things that you teach in school, none of the things Mr. Rousseau referred to earlier, English, math, science, history, I can't remember what the rest was on his list, none of those things actually improve or increase brain processing speed<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=15938.813s">[McLaughlin]</a>: The only thing that does is music.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=15941.974s">[McLaughlin]</a>: By cutting Miss Rello's position, you no longer support the arts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=15947.716s">[McLaughlin]</a>: You also no longer support the mission of the school because you no longer support the brain health of the students who go here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=15955.438s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=390.513s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1795.202s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Jenny, I'll help out any way I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1797.283s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I have experience with the Science Lab project, with the Boiler Room MSBA projects, and obviously with Fiona.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1804.407s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So if I can help you out, I'll help you out any way I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8089.897s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Yeah, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8091.878s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Melanie McLaughlin, Alston Street, Medford Moss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8094.34s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8095.42s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I just wanted to say thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8097.041s">[McLaughlin]</a>: This has been 10 years in the making.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8099.823s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And Trish, you did fantastic tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8102.404s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I felt like a proud mother, I have to say, myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8105.486s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And the community is really grateful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8107.968s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And this has been a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8110.009s">[McLaughlin]</a>: A couple of different special ed directors over the years, and a lot of teachers and hundreds of children have passed through this district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8119.505s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And it's done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8123.609s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I know, and I love that, you know, I can guarantee you Trish is not going anywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8129.434s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So, and neither are any of the other families so you know to the families that are watching tonight and to those out there who might hear about this later what have you and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8138.443s">[McLaughlin]</a>: who work every day as caregivers with their children, who do extra homework, who advocated IEP meetings, who do all those things that we know how hard they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8146.647s">[McLaughlin]</a>: We just wanna say that you're not alone and that this is really important that every child matters and that we know that this school committee feels that way and we wanna thank the school committee for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8155.651s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And one of the things I wanted to mention is that, it was actually the former special education director that used to say this to me and would remind me and I thought it was really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8164.355s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And she said, there are no special education students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8167.396s">[McLaughlin]</a>: everyone is a general student in our district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8170.297s">[McLaughlin]</a>: There are students who receive special education services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8173.318s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So we're all part of the community, and we know that, and we appreciate that, and we'll continue speaking up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8178.821s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So thank you all, and thank you guys all for what you're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8181.722s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Appreciate you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8593.032s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I ditto, I couldn't say more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8594.955s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I mean, I think that you've brought so much to the district, the first female in the district, the first black woman in the district after decades of, you know, the same leadership and having to take on an entirely new district and do all that you did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8609.395s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And the short time that you were here has been remarkable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8612.796s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I really valued working with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8614.717s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I know that I will, I really look forward to see where you're going next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8619.259s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I will be watching you and looking out for your next successes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8622.6s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I know that we'll be proud of you wherever you go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8625.562s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3111.021s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Hello, my name is Melanie McLaughlin and Austin street and men for mass Thank you Councilors for hearing us tonight and.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3118.817s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Thank you to Trish and to the parents who are really organizing a lot of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3123.699s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's great to see the energy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3126.139s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And as we think about our children and young adults in this community, I have to say that you can tell immediately people who have experience with people with disabilities, because they know how to talk to them, they know how to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3141.826s">[McLaughlin]</a>: interact with them and they appreciate and see them as human beings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3145.729s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And Councilor Leming and school committee member Olapade did that recently at the library event.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3152.134s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It was really wonderful to see them playing Uno with a number of our children and getting involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3158.139s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I'll tell you, I have a seven, I can't believe she's 17, I have a 17 year old daughter with Down syndrome, excuse my hoarseness, I have a cold, with Down syndrome, who is also legally blind and,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3171.738s">[McLaughlin]</a>: You know, she's the best thing that ever happened to us she's taught us so much about compassion and kindness and so many things, and I think when other people get to meet people with disabilities, they learn that lesson themselves, and not that our kids are here to teach the rest of us about humanity but that's just who they are and it is what they do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3190.864s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And, you know, a community that misses out on that misses out on quite a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3196.285s">[McLaughlin]</a>: and I wouldn't change anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3197.986s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I do have to say though, in terms of adaptive and other programming, I just wanna put a bug in everybody's ear too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3206.01s">[McLaughlin]</a>: As you're thinking about inclusion, adaptive is great and we want, that's the other thing is you have to have programs with support, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3211.954s">[McLaughlin]</a>: It's not just, oh yeah, you're all welcome here, which has often been the case, which is really nice, it's nice to be welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3217.677s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But if you're welcome and there's no support and then it doesn't go well, then you're really not welcome and it's setting up our kids for failure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3224.16s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So having the support to make sure that it's actually a welcoming community and an inclusive community, not just, you know, in, in theory only because it takes support it takes skill, and not from parents from people who have skill you know that been experience over the time where in the interaction with parents around skill I remember, I remember our daughter having a swim lessons in the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3247.048s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And the schools and young teenagers are working with our kids a lot and they're not really getting trained to be able to have that experience and seeing my daughter in the pool and just teaching something as simple as first then right first let's do the swimming the lab, then you'll get to go, you know, do whatever it's a really simple lesson, but if you don't know it you don't know it and so just being able to learn the basics is really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3266.504s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And as we think about the training and being able to see not just recreation, being able to see our children, again, use the library, use the coffee shops, feel welcome, feel included, and feel part of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3277.674s">[McLaughlin]</a>: I mean, I can't say enough about Amici's and West Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3281.417s">[McLaughlin]</a>: They are the most inclusive business I've experienced in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3286.541s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Mario and his team make us feel right at home, make Gracie feel right at home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3290.825s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And Amici means friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3292.91s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And he was teaching Gracie that the other day and I thought that was really beautiful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3296.531s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So I hope that you guys get the chance to meet all these wonderful young adults and people in our community, beyond just the schools and the students and you know the schools are required by law just to provide all of the extracurricular activities that any other student is entitled to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3312.837s">[McLaughlin]</a>: to every student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3314.698s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And so again, you know, we did ask when I was on the school committee to include a statement that if you need accommodations for any of these experiences please contact and we had a specific contact around what accommodations needed to be available and how parents could, you know, reach out and let folks know that they need accommodations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3331.665s">[McLaughlin]</a>: Some parents don't even want to do that because it feels like a lot for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3334.586s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So it's important to continue to reach out as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3336.527s">[McLaughlin]</a>: But that's something to consider, that how can we collaborate to make sure that the accommodations are helpful and real.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3343.33s">[McLaughlin]</a>: And I have to say this, if you've never been to a dance with people with disabilities, you're really missing out because they really dance like nobody's watching.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=3351.014s">[McLaughlin]</a>: So thank you very much.<br><br>
