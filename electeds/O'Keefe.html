    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16668.541s">[O'Keefe]</a>: when we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16669.041s">[O'Keefe]</a>: Attorney Bill O'Keefe, 18 Kilgore Avenue for Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16672.023s">[O'Keefe]</a>: I just wanted to follow up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16673.003s">[O'Keefe]</a>: I know it's always difficult when you're putting these presentations before the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16678.446s">[O'Keefe]</a>: Is the school committee gonna do this as well?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16681.809s">[O'Keefe]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16682.489s">[O'Keefe]</a>: Yeah, it should be recommended to the school committee, because I know a lot of these folks that talked issues, talked about the school committee issues, and they definitely need to get clarified so there's a clear understanding, so that everybody can understand and appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16696.596s">[O'Keefe]</a>: Like, I got a student up at the high school that's part of the vocational program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16700.438s">[O'Keefe]</a>: I mean, I've had all my kids educated at the Medford Public Schools, and I'm happy with the education that's provided at the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16706.621s">[O'Keefe]</a>: I know there were some comments about, I mean, the teachers and where they stand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16710.663s">[O'Keefe]</a>: I mean, it's all in how parents are involved and what the expectation is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16714.184s">[O'Keefe]</a>: I mean, every kid learns differently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16716.105s">[O'Keefe]</a>: My other concern is with the MCAS also being on the voting block in November, how much money do we dedicate to the MCAS in order to basically prepare for the test?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16727.509s">[O'Keefe]</a>: So there's other money that could be allocated towards whatever funding is needed to maintain a budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16733.411s">[O'Keefe]</a>: I was part of the whole recession back in 2010, 2011,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16737.432s">[O'Keefe]</a>: where everybody was getting laid off and everybody lost their job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16740.373s">[O'Keefe]</a>: It was the community that maintained everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16742.194s">[O'Keefe]</a>: You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16743.114s">[O'Keefe]</a>: Yeah, you were a student there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16744.055s">[O'Keefe]</a>: So, you know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16745.516s">[O'Keefe]</a>: You got to understand how this gets presented to everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16748.877s">[O'Keefe]</a>: You're on 23 different community channels throughout Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16752.839s">[O'Keefe]</a>: You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16753.459s">[O'Keefe]</a>: Because we're on Comcast and you're on Verizon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16755.88s">[O'Keefe]</a>: So how you present yourself and what you talk about here gets presented to leaders of industry, to people that are looking to do development, to do projects, that build businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16767.705s">[O'Keefe]</a>: I mean, so the decorum and how things get presented, you guys got to look at how that's being done and what messages is being presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16775.546s">[O'Keefe]</a>: I mean, just tonight alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16777.068s">[O'Keefe]</a>: I mean, the one thing I just haven't seen is a real plan or an understanding of a plan for six, seven, and eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16783.953s">[O'Keefe]</a>: And I'm sure it'll come out and it'll get concise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16786.195s">[O'Keefe]</a>: You guys are working through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16787.656s">[O'Keefe]</a>: There's a need to rip off the bandaid and figure out how money's going to get allocated and spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16792.1s">[O'Keefe]</a>: But it's a presentation that you make not only to the community, but to everyone else in the commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16796.904s">[O'Keefe]</a>: And if I can, with your situation in terms of the lead paint, I mean, the lead in the water, did you get your child tested?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16810.628s">[O'Keefe]</a>: I'm just asking because it's always a concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16812.81s">[O'Keefe]</a>: I mean, I know that was the biggest thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16814.771s">[O'Keefe]</a>: I was just at a meeting today with Treasurer Goldberg, and they have money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16821.476s">[O'Keefe]</a>: It's called Swirl.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16822.437s">[O'Keefe]</a>: It's an account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16823.638s">[O'Keefe]</a>: that they put in 170 schools in order to have water bubblers that are fresh water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16828.081s">[O'Keefe]</a>: And I'm not sure if that's been allocated or looked at as a resource, but she just presented that today at a community meeting for businesses and what she's doing with the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16838.348s">[O'Keefe]</a>: So that might be something you guys want to take a look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16840.97s">[O'Keefe]</a>: My understanding of the acronym is SWIRL.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16843.772s">[O'Keefe]</a>: And they have a lot of money for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16845.553s">[O'Keefe]</a>: But if there's lead in the water and stuff like that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16848.835s">[O'Keefe]</a>: I mean, should probably let the community and the kids know they should get tested just to make sure that they're not exposed to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=16854.439s">[O'Keefe]</a>: But I thank you for your time.<br><br>
