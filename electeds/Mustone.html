    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1321.709s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Fallon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1322.929s">[Mustone]</a>: I was just wondering, I saw, I don't know if you want to go two slides back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1326.65s">[Mustone]</a>: So last year there was 199 ninth graders who did CTE, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1334.012s">[Mustone]</a>: It jumped to 269 this current year for ninth graders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1342.289s">[Mustone]</a>: How many 10th graders then chose to stay in the vocational school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1346.39s">[Mustone]</a>: Wow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1346.55s">[Mustone]</a>: So that's a very large percentage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1360.217s">[Mustone]</a>: So 160 from say 200, I don't know who has the slides, but so then do you expect, so this current ninth grade class is 269.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1369.725s">[Mustone]</a>: Do you think you'll get 200 students then choosing to the vocational school in 10th grade?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1382.575s">[Mustone]</a>: So then would that lead you to, are you considering adding shops?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1413.658s">[Mustone]</a>: And then do we have any students in Medford who are going to other vocational schools because they're looking for a shop we don't offer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1428.669s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1428.969s">[Mustone]</a>: So it's not like there's something out there that people are looking for at another shop?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1449.229s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1449.569s">[Mustone]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1450.67s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4144.4s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes, member Stone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4148.463s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you for the report, Dr. Cushing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4150.624s">[Mustone]</a>: And I don't know if it's too late to ask if we could share this on the screen just because the class sizes are so low on average in every school in every grade that I know that's always a concern over the years for parents class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4163.293s">[Mustone]</a>: I know when Tegan was in kindergarten, it was 27 and then a fifth class was added to bring it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4170.0s">[Mustone]</a>: But I mean, looking at this, and I'm not a mathematician, it looks like almost the average class size is 20 across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4175.784s">[Mustone]</a>: Would you say that's the average class size?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4179.047s">[Mustone]</a>: Yeah, so I just, I think that's great for, I don't think I've seen it in black and white to realize how great that is for a classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4187.633s">[Mustone]</a>: I know Deckman has 19, so I didn't know if he was the outlier, but that seems like it's the average, so thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4193.597s">[Mustone]</a>: But this is a great, I mean, to share with,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4196.579s">[Mustone]</a>: community to see those numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4199.103s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you, Dr. Pershing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4255.929s">[Mustone]</a>: New enrollments this year, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5048.021s">[Mustone]</a>: So does it automatically they let the kids I mean 65 minutes seems like a long time for a fourth grader under reading to be working on a test.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5058.176s">[Mustone]</a>: So it doesn't cut them off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5059.457s">[Mustone]</a>: It lets them go for as long as they need to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5346.212s">[Mustone]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5346.792s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes, ma'am.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5348.614s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5350.335s">[Mustone]</a>: For the testing times, I think, and I appreciate a lot of this information was what was asked in the resolution back in the spring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5357.8s">[Mustone]</a>: So thank you for putting this all together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5360.602s">[Mustone]</a>: But I think what that question was trying to get at is more, how much of time and learning is this taking away?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5367.691s">[Mustone]</a>: from the classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5369.292s">[Mustone]</a>: So for example, you know, if a classroom, a second grade classroom has, you know, 12 kids who finish in a half an hour and then has seven more that keep going, the teacher's not going to move ahead with the curriculum that day when she knows that seven kids are not going to be able to be with her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5390.379s">[Mustone]</a>: So I'm curious if there's a way at some point in the future to get data<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5395.205s">[Mustone]</a>: more on kind of how much time and learning this takes from the classroom, not just how much individual students or the average student is, you know, to take the test.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5529.138s">[Mustone]</a>: I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5529.558s">[Mustone]</a>: I just, you know, I know that I personally I hear from parents who are concerned about how much testing is being done between the MCAS, this test,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5539.143s">[Mustone]</a>: practice and tasks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5540.423s">[Mustone]</a>: And so just in terms of being able to understand, trying to balance what is the value of the task versus how much time it's taking away from time learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5551.98s">[Mustone]</a>: I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5552.28s">[Mustone]</a>: I agree with you about the data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7178.562s">[Mustone]</a>: Marks just disappeared.<br><br>
