    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2237.971s">[Mustone]</a>: Stone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2239.092s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you all for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2240.193s">[Mustone]</a>: I do appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2241.474s">[Mustone]</a>: And Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2241.874s">[Mustone]</a>: Haas, am I saying it right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2244.176s">[Mustone]</a>: So one thing that you said that really stood out for me was just looking for support, fundraising, and opportunities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2251.201s">[Mustone]</a>: So if there is steps that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2253.343s">[Mustone]</a>: We can move forward, like this is a great conversation, but it's just the beginning of really getting to what you need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2260.531s">[Mustone]</a>: If you want to, if we could start a regular dialogue, or if you have ideas that you need our support and fundraising and help, we would all be happy to do what you need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2273.164s">[Mustone]</a>: So thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2502.946s">[Mustone]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2503.866s">[Mustone]</a>: Not just administration, we should be there too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3978.899s">[Mustone]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3979.039s">[Mustone]</a>: But if a student says to the mentor, I'm in an unhealthy relationship, I don't know what to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3985.501s">[Mustone]</a>: Does the mentor deal with it or does the mentor say, go talk to Miss Perry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3995.413s">[Mustone]</a>: has that last year where any students referred to you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5957.495s">[Mustone]</a>: She got hit by a boat, carrying a boat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6079.415s">[Mustone]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6081.416s">[Mustone]</a>: If a parent forgets to write on the slip that my child had a concussion last spring, is there a second set of eyes that will tell the coach?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6113.291s">[Mustone]</a>: But I'm saying if the parent forgets to write down the high risk, the nurse will look at the last season of sports?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6126.12s">[Mustone]</a>: Oh, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6430.039s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6431.2s">[Mustone]</a>: Just on the idea of meetings, Joan, who was here earlier with the CPA, she just had mentioned when we were in the lobby, she was just saying it was unfortunate that Wednesday night is the CPA meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6442.649s">[Mustone]</a>: And then it's also the Medford Community Coalition meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6445.63s">[Mustone]</a>: And she said, I almost wish there was a giant Google calendar for all city events.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6450.312s">[Mustone]</a>: And I don't know if that's something that this media center could put.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6453.793s">[Mustone]</a>: So there's one place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6455.074s">[Mustone]</a>: Because she said it's a lot of the same people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6457.475s">[Mustone]</a>: She wouldn't have double booked it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6459.156s">[Mustone]</a>: But is that something this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6461.755s">[Mustone]</a>: Media center could do us community calendar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6489.243s">[Mustone]</a>: Well, the Robert's Ice Cream Social is 6.30, the Andrew's Curriculum Night is 6.30, so someone doesn't get ice cream at my house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3920.124s">[Mustone]</a>: Then if a student, if someone comes looking for help from the student, who does the student then go to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3924.789s">[Mustone]</a>: Because that'd be a pretty heavy topic for a teenager.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3927.512s">[Mustone]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3942.062s">[Mustone]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6549.714s">[Mustone]</a>: I can't do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14723.13s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14724.091s">[Mustone]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14724.231s">[Mustone]</a>: Mastone, thank you for your report, both of you for your report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14728.095s">[Mustone]</a>: The last paragraph on the report is, if we were to move either program to the Andrews, there are at least 10 teachers who will need the SEI endorsement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14739.418s">[Mustone]</a>: Organizations such as MatSol, Revis, Steam, I don't know any of them, will do training in the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14744.879s">[Mustone]</a>: The cost is between $8,800 and $12,000 for anywhere from 25 to 30 participants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14750.881s">[Mustone]</a>: So that's new to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14751.681s">[Mustone]</a>: I didn't know that there was a separate training.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14753.822s">[Mustone]</a>: And is it, how long is the training?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14759.813s">[Mustone]</a>: And so these companies will all come to our city and would train the teachers who need this certification?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14803.328s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16010.997s">[Mustone]</a>: At the committee of the whole about the field trip, there was a number of parents from the CPAC organization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16018.745s">[Mustone]</a>: Did you reach out to them to ask them if this was, I don't, they spoke about the language they were looking for that made them feel confident that we were being equitable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16027.374s">[Mustone]</a>: So is that possible?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16028.415s">[Mustone]</a>: I think the chairperson said, could you reach out to me with language, I could help you with language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7137.792s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=296.203s">[Mustone]</a>: I would say if you've googled Medford school system, you probably got a lot of articles about communication within the district with parents, with teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=306.11s">[Mustone]</a>: So if you could talk about how you communicate with teachers, administrators, parents, and everyone, and children, and the students, that would be, I would love to hear it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=315.917s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=483.77s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1878.223s">[Mustone]</a>: preschool education, except that it seems like a lot of front lines of newspapers is that four-year-olds should have a universal full-day program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1887.09s">[Mustone]</a>: So I know in Boston it's K1 and K2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1889.672s">[Mustone]</a>: I don't know about North Andover or if it's something you're interested in, if you think it's something we could do here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1894.856s">[Mustone]</a>: I know parents have asked me quite often about a four-year-old program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1899.019s">[Mustone]</a>: So your thoughts, early childhood?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2019.877s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2020.657s">[Mustone]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2021.738s">[Mustone]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2021.918s">[Mustone]</a>: Kritz?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2023.078s">[Mustone]</a>: Hi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4151.896s">[Mustone]</a>: I just have one more question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4153.316s">[Mustone]</a>: Another concern of many parents is the physical space in a capital plan for upkeep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4159.637s">[Mustone]</a>: So our elementary schools and our middle schools are still new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4164.038s">[Mustone]</a>: It's 13 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4166.959s">[Mustone]</a>: But have you worked with the capital plan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4168.599s">[Mustone]</a>: How do you address the building needs, the upkeep, the maintenance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4173.18s">[Mustone]</a>: That's something that comes up often.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4176.24s">[Mustone]</a>: with our buildings?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4310.879s">[Mustone]</a>: Were you part of the writing team for the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4314.081s">[Mustone]</a>: Middle school application.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4317.907s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6688.177s">[Mustone]</a>: Good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6689.042s">[Mustone]</a>: Turn this on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6690.783s">[Mustone]</a>: So I did learn through your resume that you have middle school and high school experience, but we do have four elementary schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6696.869s">[Mustone]</a>: So if you could talk some concerns you have, both your strengths with elementary are tying it in, or concerns of now heading a school system K through 12.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6821.171s">[Mustone]</a>: Can I follow up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6822.172s">[Mustone]</a>: Certainly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6824.033s">[Mustone]</a>: So about early childhood, a lot of surrounding towns are talking about a four-year-old full day, calling it K1, pre-K, K2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6833.421s">[Mustone]</a>: So I don't know if you have thoughts on that or if you see how that could work here in MedFed or if you've<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6839.983s">[Mustone]</a>: have a plan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6866.603s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6867.203s">[Mustone]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6868.744s">[Mustone]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6868.945s">[Mustone]</a>: Kritz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=8534.2s">[Mustone]</a>: You had used the phrase you're an outsider with an insider view.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=8540.308s">[Mustone]</a>: So with that inside view, what would you say is the Medford Public Schools greatest strength and greatest weakness and how would you address the weakness?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=8672.128s">[Mustone]</a>: Just to follow up on that, I know that we've exchanged emails that I had met with the two community directors for Medford and Somerville, and that I was unaware that any student can audit a class that would be high school credit, not Tufts credit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=8686.095s">[Mustone]</a>: And that the woman, Barbara Rugal, said she's had one most of the time, at most a year three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=8692.579s">[Mustone]</a>: And that is something that they are eager to get more partnership going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=8697.161s">[Mustone]</a>: So I'm not saying that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=972.085s">[Mustone]</a>: So this is two parts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=973.366s">[Mustone]</a>: One is, what do you think is the primary function of a superintendent nowadays with so many shifting educational requirements?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=982.75s">[Mustone]</a>: And how would you implement your first steps for this priority if you were to be our superintendent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1077.511s">[Mustone]</a>: First steps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1078.212s">[Mustone]</a>: So if you were to be superintendent, what do you think your first steps would be in the new role?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3823.844s">[Mustone]</a>: So another big concern of parents that I received emails is about the upkeep<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3829.167s">[Mustone]</a>: and maintenance of our school buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3831.789s">[Mustone]</a>: So do you have experience with budget for upkeep and maintenance, or is that something that you see in your current BPS?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3841.636s">[Mustone]</a>: Is that something you've dealt with before with your schools that you are the superintendent of?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3915.634s">[Mustone]</a>: So is there a line budget item that says grounds?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4005.961s">[Mustone]</a>: And I know you've had many different roles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4008.202s">[Mustone]</a>: Have you had in one of your roles the responsibility to write a whole school budget and what was that like for you or how did it play out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4105.206s">[Mustone]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4105.786s">[Mustone]</a>: Well, I guess could I just follow up with that, just because you had mentioned community partners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4109.328s">[Mustone]</a>: Can you speak about partnerships that you've created or that you would like to see created in Medford that aren't currently here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7783.941s">[Mustone]</a>: Nice to see you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7784.881s">[Mustone]</a>: Very good to see you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7786.722s">[Mustone]</a>: So I guess my basic question is, what do you see as the primary role of the superintendent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7792.545s">[Mustone]</a>: And then following that, how would you take, what would your first steps be if you were to be the next Medford superintendent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7924.078s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=5345.322s">[Mustone]</a>: I was like a mom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=5354.998s">[Mustone]</a>: I would say over the last two and a half years, the most, the highest concern I hear from parents is the maintenance and upkeep of the buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=5363.141s">[Mustone]</a>: And that we almost need to do an inventory of all our buildings and a plan for keeping up on top of the schools every year that we still call them new schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=5374.164s">[Mustone]</a>: This is really the new high school question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=5376.825s">[Mustone]</a>: So I think it would be great to have, you know, every year we do the same checklist that every building needs to stay on top of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2302.944s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2303.304s">[Mustone]</a>: I was going to ask if Member Van der Kloot would amend her motion to send it to the policy subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2310.572s">[Mustone]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2310.992s">[Mustone]</a>: Could I make?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3080.814s">[Mustone]</a>: So I will not read the report and hope I can't do the highlights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3085.055s">[Mustone]</a>: Our agenda, five items that were discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3088.716s">[Mustone]</a>: The first was speed bumps at the high school complex.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3093.117s">[Mustone]</a>: I have emailed the chief of police and John Laughlin, our building manager, facilities manager, and they are looking into it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3102.84s">[Mustone]</a>: Second was the flashing speed signs that you see throughout the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3111.88s">[Mustone]</a>: telling us what speed we're going, if it is below the speed limit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3115.462s">[Mustone]</a>: Those are all being used throughout the city, but when one frees up, it will go to the high school complex.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3123.407s">[Mustone]</a>: The third was an update on the Andrew Glenn complex.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3126.869s">[Mustone]</a>: As of today, the sidewalks and curbing has been completed, and there's just some detailing work that needs to be finished.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3135.976s">[Mustone]</a>: Number four was regarding the school kitchen appliances, and that really stemmed from the desire to not use styrofoam plates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3146.905s">[Mustone]</a>: Rhetta Smith, the school nutritionist, did take an inventory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3150.348s">[Mustone]</a>: We do have many appliances throughout the school kitchens that need updating or repair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3158.355s">[Mustone]</a>: led us to a conversation with Alicia Hunt, who's the energy coordinator for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3162.297s">[Mustone]</a>: Kathy Kreatz and I will be meeting with her and some state officials to discuss possible grant applications to update our school kitchen appliances and other ways to be green in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3179.009s">[Mustone]</a>: The last item of our agenda was the Medford High School master plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3183.372s">[Mustone]</a>: And Mr. Brown, a teacher at the vocational high school,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3187.932s">[Mustone]</a>: gave us a report from his perspective as both a teacher and a citizen, and what is the plan for Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3197.38s">[Mustone]</a>: His questions really led us to discuss, is it about rehabbing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3204.646s">[Mustone]</a>: Is it about looking for funding to build new?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3208.349s">[Mustone]</a>: Is it about doing it in phases?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3212.552s">[Mustone]</a>: And Kathy Kreatz had<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3214.781s">[Mustone]</a>: suggested that we make a subcommittee that would almost be a master vision plan for the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3221.964s">[Mustone]</a>: So I would like to make a motion to create a subcommittee on a master vision for the high school repair and maintenance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3236.511s">[Mustone]</a>: And what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3240.173s">[Mustone]</a>: Vision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3240.813s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3720.712s">[Mustone]</a>: To clarify, I think it evolved from our typical subcommittee, our eight subcommittees, to now more of a committee like the superintendent search where community members are involved, teachers are involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3734.338s">[Mustone]</a>: It won't be three of the standing school committee members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3737.74s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3873.106s">[Mustone]</a>: Can I just ask out of the six of us who are interested in being on the Master Vision Plan Committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3877.887s">[Mustone]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3881.628s">[Mustone]</a>: So Paulette, Erin, Michael, and Kathy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3886.768s">[Mustone]</a>: They'll keep us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3653.565s">[Mustone]</a>: I just wanted to ask, so usually when something's too good to be true, it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3657.646s">[Mustone]</a>: So with Lexia letting us use it for free, does that mean in June we have to budget for $500,000 for this program?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3707.372s">[Mustone]</a>: And then what's dibbles per student?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3723.959s">[Mustone]</a>: »» Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3724.62s">[Mustone]</a>: So they are screeners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3737.0s">[Mustone]</a>: So are we looking at them together then, or are we looking at them separately?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3763.256s">[Mustone]</a>: So does DIBL and MAP?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3765.586s">[Mustone]</a>: and Rapid sell an intervention program like Lexia does?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3775.61s">[Mustone]</a>: I'm just wondering, are we choosing it because it's free, or are we choosing it because it's the best option for the screeners?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3808.026s">[Mustone]</a>: So I guess if the trial is for the year, and hopefully we learn which kids need the intervention, and then we will be looking then to use their intervention, the core five, then we do have to budget for $40 a student per year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3824.69s">[Mustone]</a>: for this program if this is what we use?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3850.049s">[Mustone]</a>: Right, and I guess, I'm sorry I'm being cynical, and I owe that to Paul, because he says there's big money in education, and he's right, because he made me read a book about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3860.619s">[Mustone]</a>: So I guess I'm just doubtful that, what is, is Lexia, is this really the best option out there, or do they market themselves so well, and give it to people for a year for free, that we end up thinking it's the best and we use it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3906.594s">[Mustone]</a>: And I'm not even being cynical just with the state of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3908.695s">[Mustone]</a>: I'm being cynical with the Department of Ed of Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3954.278s">[Mustone]</a>: And then with the core five for the intervention,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3957.273s">[Mustone]</a>: Is that, would that bring on more staff, or you are saying the classroom teacher would be the interventionist using the core five?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3963.196s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3969.36s">[Mustone]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3970.58s">[Mustone]</a>: OK, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6543.809s">[Mustone]</a>: My question was similar to Paul's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6545.89s">[Mustone]</a>: So we just take their word from their RFP that they pay their employees a living wage?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6551.946s">[Mustone]</a>: A fair living wage?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6553.086s">[Mustone]</a>: They don't say we pay our employees minimum wage?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6583.629s">[Mustone]</a>: Could they look at it again to make sure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6592.396s">[Mustone]</a>: So when future RFPs for cleaning, can we put in the language that they use for contractor RFPs that we make sure that there is a living wage included in the RFP?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6634.068s">[Mustone]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6634.368s">[Mustone]</a>: And I know you didn't ask, so you wouldn't have the answer, but moving forward,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6671.065s">[Mustone]</a>: Right, but it sounds like we didn't ask that question in the current RFP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6673.686s">[Mustone]</a>: So that's what I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6674.527s">[Mustone]</a>: Moving forward, can we put in the RFP that you provide whether it's a minimum wage or a living wage<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6681.724s">[Mustone]</a>: But I mean, on a daily basis, we hear about how the cost of living in the city of Method, no one can afford it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6688.149s">[Mustone]</a>: So it seems like we should be doing our part to have people who are working in our schools be able to have a living wage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6694.934s">[Mustone]</a>: I'll get off my soapbox.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=292.807s">[Mustone]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=335.67s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=949.659s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=169.459s">[Mustone]</a>: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5235.783s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=92.65s">[Mustone]</a>: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=99.714s">[Mustone]</a>: one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1994.219s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1995.32s">[Mustone]</a>: There are a number of seventh graders on Zoom, global scholars who have a petition for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2000.485s">[Mustone]</a>: So if there could be a suspension of the rules to have the students on Zoom make their petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2018.174s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11292.851s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12689.591s">[Mustone]</a>: Missituk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12772.133s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12960.505s">[Mustone]</a>: I believe on city Council when they have e-mails, they just put the name and address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12967.408s">[Mustone]</a>: I couldn't hear your motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15769.64s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15771.26s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15773.081s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19146.596s">[Mustone]</a>: But we've got other things, too, that we want on the yes or nos.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19150.479s">[Mustone]</a>: I'm just trying to figure out where they're available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6083.261s">[Mustone]</a>: All right, thanks, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6084.963s">[Mustone]</a>: If I could just ask the students, if you're comfortable, both of you had referred to moving forward and taking action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6090.648s">[Mustone]</a>: Could you tell us what you shared with the administration, what you would like to see happen at the high school, if you feel comfortable?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6098.016s">[Mustone]</a>: Or send me an email with what you shared with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6102.24s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay, great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6188.192s">[Mustone]</a>: One last thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6188.752s">[Mustone]</a>: I know Mr. Cushing talked about staff shortages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6193.074s">[Mustone]</a>: Is there any light at the end of the tunnel for any sort of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6198.863s">[Mustone]</a>: subcontracting with maybe an employment agency, or I know I've heard students talk about hall monitors, which I can't, we don't have enough powers of substitutes, but is there any, I guess, hope for more staff?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1321.709s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Fallon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1322.929s">[Mustone]</a>: I was just wondering, I saw, I don't know if you want to go two slides back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1326.65s">[Mustone]</a>: So last year there was 199 ninth graders who did CTE, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1334.012s">[Mustone]</a>: It jumped to 269 this current year for ninth graders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1342.289s">[Mustone]</a>: How many 10th graders then chose to stay in the vocational school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1346.39s">[Mustone]</a>: Wow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1346.55s">[Mustone]</a>: So that's a very large percentage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1360.217s">[Mustone]</a>: So 160 from say 200, I don't know who has the slides, but so then do you expect, so this current ninth grade class is 269.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1369.725s">[Mustone]</a>: Do you think you'll get 200 students then choosing to the vocational school in 10th grade?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1382.575s">[Mustone]</a>: So then would that lead you to, are you considering adding shops?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1413.658s">[Mustone]</a>: And then do we have any students in Medford who are going to other vocational schools because they're looking for a shop we don't offer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1428.669s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1428.969s">[Mustone]</a>: So it's not like there's something out there that people are looking for at another shop?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1449.229s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1449.569s">[Mustone]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1450.67s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4144.4s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes, member Stone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4148.463s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you for the report, Dr. Cushing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4150.624s">[Mustone]</a>: And I don't know if it's too late to ask if we could share this on the screen just because the class sizes are so low on average in every school in every grade that I know that's always a concern over the years for parents class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4163.293s">[Mustone]</a>: I know when Tegan was in kindergarten, it was 27 and then a fifth class was added to bring it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4170.0s">[Mustone]</a>: But I mean, looking at this, and I'm not a mathematician, it looks like almost the average class size is 20 across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4175.784s">[Mustone]</a>: Would you say that's the average class size?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4179.047s">[Mustone]</a>: Yeah, so I just, I think that's great for, I don't think I've seen it in black and white to realize how great that is for a classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4187.633s">[Mustone]</a>: I know Deckman has 19, so I didn't know if he was the outlier, but that seems like it's the average, so thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4193.597s">[Mustone]</a>: But this is a great, I mean, to share with,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4196.579s">[Mustone]</a>: community to see those numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4199.103s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you, Dr. Pershing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4255.929s">[Mustone]</a>: New enrollments this year, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5048.021s">[Mustone]</a>: So does it automatically they let the kids I mean 65 minutes seems like a long time for a fourth grader under reading to be working on a test.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5058.176s">[Mustone]</a>: So it doesn't cut them off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5059.457s">[Mustone]</a>: It lets them go for as long as they need to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5346.212s">[Mustone]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5346.792s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes, ma'am.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5348.614s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5350.335s">[Mustone]</a>: For the testing times, I think, and I appreciate a lot of this information was what was asked in the resolution back in the spring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5357.8s">[Mustone]</a>: So thank you for putting this all together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5360.602s">[Mustone]</a>: But I think what that question was trying to get at is more, how much of time and learning is this taking away?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5367.691s">[Mustone]</a>: from the classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5369.292s">[Mustone]</a>: So for example, you know, if a classroom, a second grade classroom has, you know, 12 kids who finish in a half an hour and then has seven more that keep going, the teacher's not going to move ahead with the curriculum that day when she knows that seven kids are not going to be able to be with her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5390.379s">[Mustone]</a>: So I'm curious if there's a way at some point in the future to get data<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5395.205s">[Mustone]</a>: more on kind of how much time and learning this takes from the classroom, not just how much individual students or the average student is, you know, to take the test.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5529.138s">[Mustone]</a>: I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5529.558s">[Mustone]</a>: I just, you know, I know that I personally I hear from parents who are concerned about how much testing is being done between the MCAS, this test,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5539.143s">[Mustone]</a>: practice and tasks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5540.423s">[Mustone]</a>: And so just in terms of being able to understand, trying to balance what is the value of the task versus how much time it's taking away from time learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5551.98s">[Mustone]</a>: I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5552.28s">[Mustone]</a>: I agree with you about the data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7178.562s">[Mustone]</a>: Marks just disappeared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8510.322s">[Mustone]</a>: Yeah, thank you for what.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8513.045s">[Mustone]</a>: So, personally, Declan's in fifth grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8516.788s">[Mustone]</a>: And I feel like his writing is not what his older siblings were doing in fifth grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8523.034s">[Mustone]</a>: Is there a writing curriculum that goes along with what's happening now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8527.219s">[Mustone]</a>: Or is that something that you're also looking into?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8631.0s">[Mustone]</a>: My college roommate is a teacher in Boston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8633.76s">[Mustone]</a>: She sent me the podcast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8637.861s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8638.781s">[Mustone]</a>: So we had a conversation not too long ago about it, but also the whole science of reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8644.383s">[Mustone]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8645.888s">[Mustone]</a>: Would you say, because the hybrid year of COVID are going out March of 2020, has the science of reading not been part of professional development?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8695.074s">[Mustone]</a>: So I'm just thinking of my own having kids from 2002 to 2012.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8698.716s">[Mustone]</a>: So Quinn never did phonics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8703.55s">[Mustone]</a>: So she's the 20-year-old.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8705.511s">[Mustone]</a>: So I guess my concern is the teachers who went to school and learned the science of reading, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8712.714s">[Mustone]</a>: I'm getting the, not the phonics part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8891.807s">[Mustone]</a>: Do you think our teachers, because they were teaching the non-phonics version for so long, it's hard to break into now going back to phonics?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8972.66s">[Mustone]</a>: You said you bring it in grade three, you bring it in grade four and five and different cycles or.<br><br>
