    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=168.909s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6500.758s">[Mustone]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=787.589s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2395.325s">[Mustone]</a>: Member Mustone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2396.065s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2396.586s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2398.167s">[Mustone]</a>: I'm just curious about the mini class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2400.289s">[Mustone]</a>: So I think the advantage of that with Mr. Skorka was that he was so accessible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2403.832s">[Mustone]</a>: And he was such a gift to the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2405.954s">[Mustone]</a>: I remember one student saying to me, everyone should have Mr. Skorka in their life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2409.797s">[Mustone]</a>: And I think everyone would agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2411.459s">[Mustone]</a>: So I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2413.36s">[Mustone]</a>: besides that he had a gift and a vocation for that work, are you going to hire someone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2418.584s">[Mustone]</a>: Are you posting, I don't know if his title was formerly assistant director, but I think it's hard to do the work unless you're in a classroom in the hallways with kids because they're coming and going as we all know with teenagers and to pin them down, that was the advantage of the power of Mr. Skorka.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2433.575s">[Mustone]</a>: He was always available for every student all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2451.153s">[Mustone]</a>: So will you replace a lead teacher at the high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2454.415s">[Mustone]</a>: I just think it's hard for kids to get work done when there's not an adult who's always available to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2496.419s">[Mustone]</a>: So will the advisor be the mini course teacher?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2564.041s">[Mustone]</a>: It does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2564.641s">[Mustone]</a>: I don't think it's going to be as successful with not having a lead teacher as the advisor because he was just always available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2572.686s">[Mustone]</a>: I mean, I just know from my own senior who had been very involved and from her classmates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2578.629s">[Mustone]</a>: So I guess my recommendation would be ideal if the advisor was the lead teacher because then the kids have wonderful ideas that take a lot of footwork to get them happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2588.314s">[Mustone]</a>: So that's my only concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=3026.436s">[Mustone]</a>: That one's from Amazon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=3336.979s">[Mustone]</a>: I also think Mr. Jackson sounds like a great candidate for the CCSR advisor program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZOridbGJ9hA&t=139.9s">[Mustone]</a>: I am sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZOridbGJ9hA&t=140.72s">[Mustone]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZOridbGJ9hA&t=1452.34s">[Mustone]</a>: Melanie, just, sorry, I'm on my phone, which I'm not used to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZOridbGJ9hA&t=1454.942s">[Mustone]</a>: So I'm taking a little minute to get used to doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZOridbGJ9hA&t=1458.964s">[Mustone]</a>: I agree with everyone that everyone's saying, and it's, I can't believe we don't already do all this for our parents and making sure all the kids are included in all the school activities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZOridbGJ9hA&t=1468.791s">[Mustone]</a>: So I just, I'm trying to be clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZOridbGJ9hA&t=1470.973s">[Mustone]</a>: Are we writing a policy to just like, is it looking for funding to make sure that staff's available for like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZOridbGJ9hA&t=1479.903s">[Mustone]</a>: What do we need to do to make this happen that everything is available for all the kids?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZOridbGJ9hA&t=3098.681s">[Mustone]</a>: Second, Melanie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZOridbGJ9hA&t=3209.873s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZOridbGJ9hA&t=3212.738s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZOridbGJ9hA&t=3215.02s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4548.507s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4549.468s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4549.949s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you member Graham every stone tour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4552.212s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you for connecting with everyone over the last week that's great to reach out to the formal and the rec department, I'm excited about them starting a youth track program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4560.121s">[Mustone]</a>: And I'm just wondering is there coach app or job website for coaches specifically I know it's posted on NPS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4568.763s">[Mustone]</a>: And is it posted on school spring or spring school yet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4595.975s">[Mustone]</a>: And is it that you've looked and there's no, I don't know about coaches.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4599.136s">[Mustone]</a>: I just don't imagine there would be a specific coaching.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7056.76s">[Mustone]</a>: I can wait if you're going off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7120.579s">[Mustone]</a>: No, I was just going to say, could one of the goals be to expand our finance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7126.762s">[Mustone]</a>: I love that in the budgetary priorities, you have a theater teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7131.425s">[Mustone]</a>: So I think just the option of expanding or the goal of expanding more theater electives, both in the middle school and the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7140.269s">[Mustone]</a>: And if we could even increase<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7142.489s">[Mustone]</a>: the music options in the middle school and the high school, which of course would take on more staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7147.17s">[Mustone]</a>: But I really think we've all received a number of emails with all the benefits of theater and music for students, both in the middle school and the high school level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7156.791s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=9148.859s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=9150.081s">[Mustone]</a>: Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=9151.013s">[Mustone]</a>: Member Mustone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=9152.734s">[Mustone]</a>: I might've missed it for old business, but last week the student rep Noah had brought up about the locked bathrooms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=9159.657s">[Mustone]</a>: And I don't remember if there was gonna be a follow-up about the schedule of the bathrooms, locked bathrooms, or just to respond to Noah's inquiry about when they're locked or when they're unlocked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=904.487s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=906.529s">[Mustone]</a>: Two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=907.149s">[Mustone]</a>: One is to Member Graham's point about that we might not all be there because there'll be an election in November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=911.972s">[Mustone]</a>: I want to say this will be my last term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=913.933s">[Mustone]</a>: So for community members and parents out there, please consider running or consider encouraging friends and family to run.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=920.557s">[Mustone]</a>: It's been a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=923.158s">[Mustone]</a>: An interesting seven and a half years and I think eight years is a good time for a public servant to bow out and let pass on the torch to someone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=932.406s">[Mustone]</a>: And the next one is that recently we've had many emails about arts and music and the benefits to children and teens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=941.174s">[Mustone]</a>: So I think I'd like a goal to be almost a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=944.597s">[Mustone]</a>: a deep dive into our finance department and see if there's places we can expand or ideas that other schools are incorporating that are successful that we could look into.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=954.087s">[Mustone]</a>: But in addition,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=956.768s">[Mustone]</a>: I was able to go to two of the concerts in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=960.209s">[Mustone]</a>: I don't even know what month we're in, but they were wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=962.809s">[Mustone]</a>: And the parents all there and grandparents all had such wonderful things to say about the fine arts department and the music.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=968.671s">[Mustone]</a>: And I know the music department has started the jumpstart camp and has expanded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=972.431s">[Mustone]</a>: And I think it's been beneficial to everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=974.932s">[Mustone]</a>: So just, I think expanding fine arts would be a goal for myself and a lot of parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=980.973s">[Mustone]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6058.864s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you very much for all that information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6060.966s">[Mustone]</a>: Is there any conversation about adding another language to the world language department I know in the past people had emailed, both for Chinese Arabic, or even sign language and I didn't know if that was a conversation to expand the languages we offer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8510.322s">[Mustone]</a>: Yeah, thank you for what.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8513.045s">[Mustone]</a>: So, personally, Declan's in fifth grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8516.788s">[Mustone]</a>: And I feel like his writing is not what his older siblings were doing in fifth grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8523.034s">[Mustone]</a>: Is there a writing curriculum that goes along with what's happening now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8527.219s">[Mustone]</a>: Or is that something that you're also looking into?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8631.0s">[Mustone]</a>: My college roommate is a teacher in Boston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8633.76s">[Mustone]</a>: She sent me the podcast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8637.861s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8638.781s">[Mustone]</a>: So we had a conversation not too long ago about it, but also the whole science of reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8644.383s">[Mustone]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8645.888s">[Mustone]</a>: Would you say, because the hybrid year of COVID are going out March of 2020, has the science of reading not been part of professional development?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8695.074s">[Mustone]</a>: So I'm just thinking of my own having kids from 2002 to 2012.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8698.716s">[Mustone]</a>: So Quinn never did phonics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8703.55s">[Mustone]</a>: So she's the 20-year-old.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8705.511s">[Mustone]</a>: So I guess my concern is the teachers who went to school and learned the science of reading, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8712.714s">[Mustone]</a>: I'm getting the, not the phonics part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8891.807s">[Mustone]</a>: Do you think our teachers, because they were teaching the non-phonics version for so long, it's hard to break into now going back to phonics?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8972.66s">[Mustone]</a>: You said you bring it in grade three, you bring it in grade four and five and different cycles or.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1f4Nwqi6Ka4&t=4119.758s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes, Member Mustone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1f4Nwqi6Ka4&t=4123.802s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you for the report, Dr. Cushing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1f4Nwqi6Ka4&t=4125.965s">[Mustone]</a>: And I don't know if it's too late to ask if we could share this on the screen just because the class sizes are so low on average in every school in every grade that I know that's always a concern over the years for parents class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1f4Nwqi6Ka4&t=4138.638s">[Mustone]</a>: I know when Tegan was in kindergarten, it was 27 and then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1f4Nwqi6Ka4&t=4143.237s">[Mustone]</a>: fifth class was added to bring it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1f4Nwqi6Ka4&t=4145.338s">[Mustone]</a>: But I mean, looking at this, and I'm not a mathematician, it looks like almost the average class size is 20 across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1f4Nwqi6Ka4&t=4151.12s">[Mustone]</a>: Would you say that's the average class size?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1f4Nwqi6Ka4&t=4154.381s">[Mustone]</a>: Yeah, so I just, I think that's great for, I don't think I've seen it in black and white to realize how great that is for classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1f4Nwqi6Ka4&t=4162.965s">[Mustone]</a>: I know Declan has 19, so I didn't know if he was the outlier, but that seems like it's the average.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1f4Nwqi6Ka4&t=4167.727s">[Mustone]</a>: So thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1f4Nwqi6Ka4&t=4168.927s">[Mustone]</a>: But this is a great, I mean, to share with,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1f4Nwqi6Ka4&t=4171.923s">[Mustone]</a>: community to see those numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1f4Nwqi6Ka4&t=4174.447s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1f4Nwqi6Ka4&t=4281.735s">[Mustone]</a>: Member Ruseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4144.4s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes, member Stone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4148.463s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you for the report, Dr. Cushing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4150.624s">[Mustone]</a>: And I don't know if it's too late to ask if we could share this on the screen just because the class sizes are so low on average in every school in every grade that I know that's always a concern over the years for parents class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4163.293s">[Mustone]</a>: I know when Tegan was in kindergarten, it was 27 and then a fifth class was added to bring it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4170.0s">[Mustone]</a>: But I mean, looking at this, and I'm not a mathematician, it looks like almost the average class size is 20 across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4175.784s">[Mustone]</a>: Would you say that's the average class size?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4179.047s">[Mustone]</a>: Yeah, so I just, I think that's great for, I don't think I've seen it in black and white to realize how great that is for a classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4187.633s">[Mustone]</a>: I know Deckman has 19, so I didn't know if he was the outlier, but that seems like it's the average, so thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4193.597s">[Mustone]</a>: But this is a great, I mean, to share with,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4196.579s">[Mustone]</a>: community to see those numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4199.103s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you, Dr. Pershing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4255.929s">[Mustone]</a>: New enrollments this year, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5048.021s">[Mustone]</a>: So does it automatically they let the kids I mean 65 minutes seems like a long time for a fourth grader under reading to be working on a test.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5058.176s">[Mustone]</a>: So it doesn't cut them off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5059.457s">[Mustone]</a>: It lets them go for as long as they need to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5346.212s">[Mustone]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5346.792s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes, ma'am.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5348.614s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5350.335s">[Mustone]</a>: For the testing times, I think, and I appreciate a lot of this information was what was asked in the resolution back in the spring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5357.8s">[Mustone]</a>: So thank you for putting this all together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5360.602s">[Mustone]</a>: But I think what that question was trying to get at is more, how much of time and learning is this taking away?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5367.691s">[Mustone]</a>: from the classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5369.292s">[Mustone]</a>: So for example, you know, if a classroom, a second grade classroom has, you know, 12 kids who finish in a half an hour and then has seven more that keep going, the teacher's not going to move ahead with the curriculum that day when she knows that seven kids are not going to be able to be with her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5390.379s">[Mustone]</a>: So I'm curious if there's a way at some point in the future to get data<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5395.205s">[Mustone]</a>: more on kind of how much time and learning this takes from the classroom, not just how much individual students or the average student is, you know, to take the test.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5529.138s">[Mustone]</a>: I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5529.558s">[Mustone]</a>: I just, you know, I know that I personally I hear from parents who are concerned about how much testing is being done between the MCAS, this test,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5539.143s">[Mustone]</a>: practice and tasks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5540.423s">[Mustone]</a>: And so just in terms of being able to understand, trying to balance what is the value of the task versus how much time it's taking away from time learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5551.98s">[Mustone]</a>: I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5552.28s">[Mustone]</a>: I agree with you about the data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7178.562s">[Mustone]</a>: Marks just disappeared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4498.957s">[Mustone]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4499.097s">[Mustone]</a>: Stone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4500.398s">[Mustone]</a>: So three of our kids are going on the trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4503.519s">[Mustone]</a>: I will be not chaperoning for a 24-hour train ride, but if you do get Southwest, then I would like to volunteer to chaperone if you get that flight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4512.683s">[Mustone]</a>: So thank you, but Teague and Nevin and Rowan seem to be very excited that they think it's the Orient Express that they're going on to Florida.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=11985.797s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=11986.84s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you everybody for all the presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=11989.262s">[Mustone]</a>: I do feel like I'm kind of in a time warp because it was probably more than five years ago, or maybe just about, I don't think many people in this room were there then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=11998.147s">[Mustone]</a>: There was a concern with MCAS that the Brooks had nailed it in every area, in every grade, in every subject, and unfortunately other schools did not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12006.412s">[Mustone]</a>: And what came up was Title I, the three schools had Title I, but the Brooks still had a reading specialist that did the work of Title I, but wasn't paid for by Title I.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12015.109s">[Mustone]</a>: At the Roberts, I know firsthand, oh, I can figure it out, because Quinn was in second grade, and now she's a sophomore in college.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12019.852s">[Mustone]</a>: So that's how long ago it was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12021.513s">[Mustone]</a>: So she tested for Title I. Unfortunately, she was not the lowest of the seven that made it to Title I. So her teacher said, unfortunately, she's not the lowest of the seven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12032.44s">[Mustone]</a>: You're right, she definitely has a reading hiccup.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12035.402s">[Mustone]</a>: So I said, so if she was in another class or another school, she might have been the lowest of the seven, depending who her peers were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12041.966s">[Mustone]</a>: So I think, and tell me if I'm not saying what people are thinking, but I think that's where the concern is like we have schools that have much greater need, but they still have the same staff as the Brooks who's doing great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12055.457s">[Mustone]</a>: So I think that's where the frustrations coming from like shouldn't we put the support for the school that might have 14 kids who really need title one but only seven of them are eligible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12204.881s">[Mustone]</a>: And right, we have math.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12206.843s">[Mustone]</a>: Remember what the yeah, the teacher had been out and then the replacement was out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12221.852s">[Mustone]</a>: But no, but it's a good conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12247.774s">[Mustone]</a>: That's good news too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12255.964s">[Mustone]</a>: You said they're back?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12256.864s">[Mustone]</a>: Sorry, I thought you meant they increased their numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12273.248s">[Mustone]</a>: So more support should go there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12275.189s">[Mustone]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12400.864s">[Mustone]</a>: Do you want me to read?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12402.787s">[Mustone]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12403.247s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12403.928s">[Mustone]</a>: You want to go home?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12466.153s">[Mustone]</a>: Are the meetings in person at the high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=13671.065s">[Mustone]</a>: Is 46 the one that goes to the subcommittee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/U-vb-ame39Y&t=92.249s">[Mustone]</a>: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1321.709s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Fallon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1322.929s">[Mustone]</a>: I was just wondering, I saw, I don't know if you want to go two slides back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1326.65s">[Mustone]</a>: So last year there was 199 ninth graders who did CTE, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1334.012s">[Mustone]</a>: It jumped to 269 this current year for ninth graders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1342.289s">[Mustone]</a>: How many 10th graders then chose to stay in the vocational school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1346.39s">[Mustone]</a>: Wow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1346.55s">[Mustone]</a>: So that's a very large percentage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1360.217s">[Mustone]</a>: So 160 from say 200, I don't know who has the slides, but so then do you expect, so this current ninth grade class is 269.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1369.725s">[Mustone]</a>: Do you think you'll get 200 students then choosing to the vocational school in 10th grade?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1382.575s">[Mustone]</a>: So then would that lead you to, are you considering adding shops?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1413.658s">[Mustone]</a>: And then do we have any students in Medford who are going to other vocational schools because they're looking for a shop we don't offer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1428.669s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1428.969s">[Mustone]</a>: So it's not like there's something out there that people are looking for at another shop?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1449.229s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1449.569s">[Mustone]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1450.67s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=93.385s">[Mustone]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=95.426s">[Mustone]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=177.614s">[Mustone]</a>: On the calendar, does it say July 3rd, when?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=183.211s">[Mustone]</a>: Oh, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=183.971s">[Mustone]</a>: That's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=413.178s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=413.538s">[Mustone]</a>: I'm happy with my evaluation and I haven't heard anyone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=417.278s">[Mustone]</a>: I'm just going by the emails that were sent to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=419.479s">[Mustone]</a>: So I also just thought we were, it was Melanie who felt like that they are Melanie didn't feel like she, um, fills out the evaluation correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=427.86s">[Mustone]</a>: And so that's why we're meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=429.06s">[Mustone]</a>: And then it was just to make her changes to be put in for the average score, I guess, because we didn't, I didn't see anyone else's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=437.662s">[Mustone]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=930.524s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4951.145s">[Mustone]</a>: Hi, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4951.886s">[Mustone]</a>: I think we're probably wrapping up since it's 528.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4954.448s">[Mustone]</a>: But two points, which I wasn't sure if other people are going to touch upon them before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4958.532s">[Mustone]</a>: I didn't want to repeat my colleagues sentiment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4962.255s">[Mustone]</a>: For communication, I know teachers have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4965.367s">[Mustone]</a>: spoke to me about just more communication directly with the teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4969.632s">[Mustone]</a>: We do all appreciate the newsletter for the families, but maybe there could be a separate newsletter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4974.456s">[Mustone]</a>: It doesn't have to be weekly, maybe monthly, just for the teachers to know what's happened academically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4980.622s">[Mustone]</a>: Schedule-wise for the different grade levels, or maybe some points of information that are coming down from DESE.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4988.473s">[Mustone]</a>: So, teachers on across the board know where you are coming with with your vision or your goals I think that would be helpful so they all know why things are getting implemented because this is what you're hoping to do to benefit public schools to make them better for every child which I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5004.693s">[Mustone]</a>: I know without a doubt that you are thinking of every child every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5008.556s">[Mustone]</a>: And the second part is now that COVID is subsiding and that we can, I know you love to do the data stuff and that we have science that is rolled out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5020.385s">[Mustone]</a>: We have math that is mid rolled out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5022.767s">[Mustone]</a>: And now also, now it's time to look at the English for,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5029.438s">[Mustone]</a>: ELA for all grades and for social studies slash history slash civics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5037.082s">[Mustone]</a>: But I think now that we have more time because you have less responsibility with COVID decisions, which you had to make those on a daily basis, that I think parents, those are my two things that parents have said to me recently, is now talk about English, social studies, and teaches more communication directly with the teachers<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5058.58s">[Mustone]</a>: And that's, I think other than that, I know you are on the clock 24 hours a day, every day of the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5065.322s">[Mustone]</a>: And I think most of the community understands that and appreciates that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5071.123s">[Mustone]</a>: So I just look forward to now, you know, I guess going back to when you were hired and your goals then, now, you know, you were slowed down with COVID, but now you can kick it back into gear and it's exciting to see what Medford Public Schools are gonna go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5086.287s">[Mustone]</a>: So thank you, Dr. Maurice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5139.878s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5140.198s">[Mustone]</a>: We're all on the same team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2457.464s">[Mustone]</a>: I also want to just thank you all because I think it's been years that you were lobbying for the adaptive physical education teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2465.461s">[Mustone]</a>: And this past year has been awesome with the United basketball program that I know Miss Kyla Andre ran.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2470.985s">[Mustone]</a>: And so I just want people to know that CPAC really gets stuff done and that if they're looking to get something done to join your group, because you guys are the best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2478.79s">[Mustone]</a>: So thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=10886.2s">[Mustone]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=10886.861s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=10887.382s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=10888.106s">[Mustone]</a>: Remember Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=10888.546s">[Mustone]</a>: Stone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=10889.007s">[Mustone]</a>: I just have to say thank you that Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=10890.968s">[Mustone]</a>: Frito taught four of our six kids for first grade and taught them all how to read.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=10895.391s">[Mustone]</a>: And I appreciate that foundation that she gave them all that they still talk about you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=10899.954s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=10900.415s">[Mustone]</a>: So thank you for being there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=13155.913s">[Mustone]</a>: It appears that all of us are hearing it for the first time, except for member Graham and possible member Rousseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=13161.778s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay, so I don't feel comfortable voting on the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=13164.56s">[Mustone]</a>: I thought we were just voting on the budget tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=13166.262s">[Mustone]</a>: That's what I would like to vote on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=13168.464s">[Mustone]</a>: If you want to put that forth as yourself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=13312.089s">[Mustone]</a>: A motion to approve the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=13316.31s">[Mustone]</a>: Close to 69 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=13422.579s">[Mustone]</a>: And I know we do have a letter that was sent out on June 2 to Senator Lewis, the Massachusetts healthy school lunch coalition reached out to ask for us to support their Massachusetts healthy<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=13437.489s">[Mustone]</a>: healthy school lunch HG 3, 1, 5, 9, SD 1, 3, 0, 8, co sponsored by Senator Jason Lewis and representative Alice Pache.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=13446.595s">[Mustone]</a>: The health of our children is built on a foundation of high quality nutrition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=13449.557s">[Mustone]</a>: Every meal they're served is an opportunity to help them build healthy habits for life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=13453.139s">[Mustone]</a>: The Massachusetts Healthy School Lunch Bill calls to replace disease promoting foods typically served for lunch with healthful and planet friendly whole foods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=13460.664s">[Mustone]</a>: It also holds food service companies accountable to ensure the nutritional quality of school food is prioritized over profit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=13467.833s">[Mustone]</a>: It is time to address inequitable diet-related disease in children's health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=13472.195s">[Mustone]</a>: And this is asking the legislation will provide much-needed nutrition security for the more than 500,000 students who rely on school lunches each day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=13481.178s">[Mustone]</a>: And I'm asking everyone to support this important legislation and send it to Senator Jason M. Lewis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=3960.502s">[Mustone]</a>: Mr. Zizzo has his hand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=4054.881s">[Mustone]</a>: I just had a question that I know that a different compost company has the city of Medford contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=4060.465s">[Mustone]</a>: We can check with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=4061.145s">[Mustone]</a>: So I don't know if they would give us a discount because they have the whole city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=4064.027s">[Mustone]</a>: So if we could look into that, I'm happy to call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=4066.929s">[Mustone]</a>: Yep, we definitely can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=4068.19s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=4827.836s">[Mustone]</a>: Derek, are you Derek?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=4828.977s">[Mustone]</a>: All right, so Derek and I haven't met in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=4830.738s">[Mustone]</a>: So Derek is a dad who has some words he'd like to share if there could be a suspension to hear from him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10980.221s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=8099.123s">[Mustone]</a>: Mayor Lungo-Koehn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=7.043s">[Mustone]</a>: I'm not sure if someone can remove Declan's name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=9.825s">[Mustone]</a>: I, of course, can't figure it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=12.427s">[Mustone]</a>: I was from a CCD class on Sunday morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=171.068s">[Mustone]</a>: Just did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=317.793s">[Mustone]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5409.072s">[Mustone]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=3674.538s">[Mustone]</a>: There is a bus line item budget for the Machi band.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=3676.98s">[Mustone]</a>: I know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5169.874s">[Mustone]</a>: Stone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5170.834s">[Mustone]</a>: I understand it's a lot when you just read it out loud, but I also know that since I've been on for six years, we have been asking to have a system like the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5179.577s">[Mustone]</a>: So we know, just thinking right now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5182.535s">[Mustone]</a>: We talked about the McGlynn roof that kindergarten classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5185.297s">[Mustone]</a>: I'm imagining it got fixed because we haven't heard from parents or teachers, but we never got an official response back from that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5191.902s">[Mustone]</a>: We had students here about the bathrooms at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5194.264s">[Mustone]</a>: We hear that they're getting built.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5195.825s">[Mustone]</a>: We haven't had an update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5196.946s">[Mustone]</a>: There's no way to look for me to say to parents when they reach out to me, oh, yep, the bathrooms are coming in May of 2022.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5203.732s">[Mustone]</a>: We had the girls locker room that parents emailed regularly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5207.716s">[Mustone]</a>: Unfortunately, the students at the high school is still telling me that the locker room has not had a great facelift that it's still looking similar to that it looked in September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5217.026s">[Mustone]</a>: So, I understand when you read it out loud but I feel like those are quick entries of a date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5224.577s">[Mustone]</a>: the person who said it, the meeting time for the subcommittee, but it is frustrating as a school committee member that parents email us repeatedly and we don't have answers for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5236.123s">[Mustone]</a>: And I think it's just almost getting into the habit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5239.125s">[Mustone]</a>: Everything is hard at the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5241.146s">[Mustone]</a>: And then we kind of get into a flow with school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5243.367s">[Mustone]</a>: We'll say the things more clearly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5245.168s">[Mustone]</a>: So the minutes can be more clear for the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5250.031s">[Mustone]</a>: minute takers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5252.317s">[Mustone]</a>: So I do think this is something that's very necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5254.704s">[Mustone]</a>: I don't know if there was a first if I can be the second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5258.2s">[Mustone]</a>: There is a motion on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zg4eBCSCY8E&t=4330.623s">[Mustone]</a>: $50,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zg4eBCSCY8E&t=4330.923s">[Mustone]</a>: So I think for anyone interested in robotics and engineering, the laser cutter is amazing and we'll have a lot of future engineers because of that program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zg4eBCSCY8E&t=4341.27s">[Mustone]</a>: And the teachers too, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zg4eBCSCY8E&t=4343.011s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zg4eBCSCY8E&t=4344.172s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zg4eBCSCY8E&t=5204.466s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zg4eBCSCY8E&t=5205.533s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you for volunteering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zg4eBCSCY8E&t=5206.633s">[Mustone]</a>: I'm just wondering, is the school administration part of this group at present?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zg4eBCSCY8E&t=5212.695s">[Mustone]</a>: Or have you talked to Chief Buckley?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zg4eBCSCY8E&t=5221.817s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zg4eBCSCY8E&t=5223.357s">[Mustone]</a>: Do you want- Member Grant?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zg4eBCSCY8E&t=5228.378s">[Mustone]</a>: And then, member Rousseau, because we're taught with the masks associated school committees,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zg4eBCSCY8E&t=5235.987s">[Mustone]</a>: You can't represent us right or you can't speak as a school committee member you're going to report back to us to make sure what they're proposing follows education law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3695.67s">[Mustone]</a>: Member of the stone and it's your just a quick question I don't in past years with after-school programs like the handshines<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3704.316s">[Mustone]</a>: that kids who did the YMCA afterschool program weren't available to, didn't have the transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3709.979s">[Mustone]</a>: Can kids who go to the YMCA at Chevalier be able to take a late bus there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3714.881s">[Mustone]</a>: Just to make that clear to families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3716.482s">[Mustone]</a>: Each school will have one late bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3718.703s">[Mustone]</a>: And their own late bus to whatever stop they need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3721.304s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3721.584s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4525.415s">[Mustone]</a>: Member miss stone, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4528.306s">[Mustone]</a>: How do students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4529.537s">[Mustone]</a>: Do they self-identify that they want to do the math program or would math teachers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4563.098s">[Mustone]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4563.418s">[Mustone]</a>: So students who struggle with math, and this is, I'm speaking as a parent of kids who struggle with math, it would be hard to sell them on five hours a day of math over a vacation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4576.321s">[Mustone]</a>: So is there some sort of incentive we can give to the students who participate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=40.746s">[Mustone]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=42.507s">[Mustone]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=54.27s">[Mustone]</a>: I pledge allegiance to the flag<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=63.218s">[Mustone]</a>: and justice for all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1788.817s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you for being here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1790.018s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1791.238s">[Mustone]</a>: The part about reviewing the instructional practices policies, anything written, do you like highlight it and say, this needs to be worked on and give us a revision or do you leave us to do the revisioning?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1864.913s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1865.554s">[Mustone]</a>: So Dr. Maurice, do you think the recommendations that we are given by the equity process come May, would they go to the Racial Equity Committee to put them into action or will we address that later on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1924.033s">[Mustone]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1924.493s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1926.275s">[Mustone]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1926.835s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8683.882s">[Mustone]</a>: I'm not sure if it's for Mr. Cushing or Dr. Maurice, but have the engagement specialist have a better handle on absenteeism, which I know some kids, because of retention or absence, end up going to summer school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8701.093s">[Mustone]</a>: So do you know if that is the attendance better with engagement specialists this year in place?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9653.49s">[Mustone]</a>: Sorry, I had my hand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9654.671s">[Mustone]</a>: Oh, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9655.231s">[Mustone]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9655.651s">[Mustone]</a>: I didn't see it, I didn't see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9658.272s">[Mustone]</a>: Member Ruseau, is, just because it's worthy,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9662.966s">[Mustone]</a>: Can people, I know on the last meeting, people could still write to us, to the school committee email.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9672.028s">[Mustone]</a>: I'm one ahead, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10654.131s">[Mustone]</a>: That doesn't help, the people not on the Rules Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10656.212s">[Mustone]</a>: Yeah, I was gonna say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11205.434s">[Mustone]</a>: I think we all get very tired when we have those meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11217.762s">[Mustone]</a>: Wednesday's not going to be there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12643.156s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12644.518s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=484.822s">[Mustone]</a>: I think in the past that the mayor had gone with what people thought were priorities and then named the subcommittees and then asked each of us which subcommittees we would like to be on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=496.353s">[Mustone]</a>: I know the subcommittees have changed by title with different concerns that have come up in the previous year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=502.94s">[Mustone]</a>: So I would say put the mayor for designating the names of the subcommittees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHKDy2Mf3XI&t=1549.87s">[Mustone]</a>: I just want to say I got it for Teagan and it was great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHKDy2Mf3XI&t=1552.25s">[Mustone]</a>: And I forwarded to Teagan and said, these are your people if you need them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHKDy2Mf3XI&t=1554.911s">[Mustone]</a>: So it was to the point and what we needed to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHKDy2Mf3XI&t=1576.064s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHKDy2Mf3XI&t=1577.284s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes, with all the different groups, which they were, they looked great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHKDy2Mf3XI&t=1581.786s">[Mustone]</a>: So thank you for doing all those groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YHKDy2Mf3XI&t=1982.994s">[Mustone]</a>: Motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6083.261s">[Mustone]</a>: All right, thanks, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6084.963s">[Mustone]</a>: If I could just ask the students, if you're comfortable, both of you had referred to moving forward and taking action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6090.648s">[Mustone]</a>: Could you tell us what you shared with the administration, what you would like to see happen at the high school, if you feel comfortable?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6098.016s">[Mustone]</a>: Or send me an email with what you shared with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6102.24s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay, great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6188.192s">[Mustone]</a>: One last thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6188.752s">[Mustone]</a>: I know Mr. Cushing talked about staff shortages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6193.074s">[Mustone]</a>: Is there any light at the end of the tunnel for any sort of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6198.863s">[Mustone]</a>: subcontracting with maybe an employment agency, or I know I've heard students talk about hall monitors, which I can't, we don't have enough powers of substitutes, but is there any, I guess, hope for more staff?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1486.185s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1486.966s">[Mustone]</a>: Um, I was thinking just having two girls at the Andrews and how popular so many of the clubs are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1495.491s">[Mustone]</a>: I know that the CCSR is partnering with a mom who's teaching a sewing class to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1504.488s">[Mustone]</a>: create toiletry bags, and then collect goods to stuff in the toiletry bags to give to the Bread of Life in Malden for their guests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1513.691s">[Mustone]</a>: So I didn't know, back to Tonya was talking about the buddy program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1517.332s">[Mustone]</a>: I didn't know if that could be a place that all kids could come together, pack the bags with their peers, and then follow up with maybe doing service projects together in conjunction with the buddy program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1534.059s">[Mustone]</a>: I don't know if that would be something that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1651.848s">[Mustone]</a>: So I guess just to move forward, could I work with someone at the Andrews Middle School to at least get, I think this will be a short, successful service project that we could have all kids involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1669.565s">[Mustone]</a>: I don't know if anyone wants, I don't know if I'm overstepping or if that's something I can reach out and work with the teachers at the Andrews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1694.023s">[Mustone]</a>: It's miss been doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1695.424s">[Mustone]</a>: And it's just, I think it's, it's, it's nice because the kids will have, they'll be able to see their impact so the sewing club is going to make the toiletry bags, and then they're going to do a drive for you know, little toothpaste or deodorant or what have you, they have a list from bread of life, it will go into the spring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1715.822s">[Mustone]</a>: And so, and I think it will just be a few, probably a few days that we'll meet after school to compile the toiletry bags and then pack up my van.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1724.345s">[Mustone]</a>: But I think it'd be a great place for kids to be together and doing something fun and service to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1745.628s">[Mustone]</a>: And then I just don't know if there's teachers, Joan, you would know who the best teachers are to invite?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1769.171s">[Mustone]</a>: And this literally just started in an email yesterday so we are fresh, you know, we're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1773.814s">[Mustone]</a>: We're not joining something that's happening it's just just an email started yesterday so we are all together at the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1779.758s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay, good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1787.382s">[Mustone]</a>: Is that the- I don't think so because they'll have to have a while to sew and the mom who sews has two groups because she only has 14 sewing machines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1796.625s">[Mustone]</a>: So I think she'll be a while before all the sewing kids will be able to sew their own toiletry bags.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1800.946s">[Mustone]</a>: So I'm thinking probably more of the spring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1802.947s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1912.107s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay, then I'll email you tomorrow, Joan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1914.751s">[Mustone]</a>: All right, sounds good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1915.453s">[Mustone]</a>: And whoever else wants to be on the email.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=1916.735s">[Mustone]</a>: I'll email everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o3BqzLm3DbU&t=2679.772s">[Mustone]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3333.133s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3334.394s">[Mustone]</a>: Can you just explain how the referral system works for people to see these hub leaders?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3344.823s">[Mustone]</a>: But they're in the schools now, but are they not seeing kids directly yet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3431.377s">[Mustone]</a>: But is there a ballpark of how many students say they've seen at the four elementary schools combined?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3475.505s">[Mustone]</a>: All right, I guess I'm just, I'm trying to figure out, is there an epidemic happening that there's a lot of families that aren't engaged and we need more than five team specialists?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3485.987s">[Mustone]</a>: Are they seeing five kids a day or are they seeing one a week?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3576.993s">[Mustone]</a>: specialist has met a family and they need a lot of assistance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3581.337s">[Mustone]</a>: So then do they then meet weekly with the adjustment Councilor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3584.56s">[Mustone]</a>: Do we need more adjustment Councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3586.001s">[Mustone]</a>: Or I guess it's too early to learn what we're going to need after the engagement specialist are meeting with all these families and students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3662.148s">[Mustone]</a>: So then at the end of this year, will the initiative tell us what we should be prioritizing with staff?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3668.891s">[Mustone]</a>: I imagine there's going to be a need for more staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3673.063s">[Mustone]</a>: there's many families being referred to the specialist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3690.773s">[Mustone]</a>: The specialist is like a caseworker.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3692.714s">[Mustone]</a>: So they're not seeing students one-on-one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3696.556s">[Mustone]</a>: They are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3696.976s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3697.356s">[Mustone]</a>: I didn't realize that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3698.137s">[Mustone]</a>: So they can meet with students one-on-one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=3701.372s">[Mustone]</a>: to have a counseling session are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5914.588s">[Mustone]</a>: It's been years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5917.765s">[Mustone]</a>: So I'll let you finish, but then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6006.353s">[Mustone]</a>: Mr. Murphy, I know it was long before you got here, but the teachers from those classrooms have been emailing for years that periodically they had flooding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6015.36s">[Mustone]</a>: So I am a little upset that it took a parent to come here with pictures to finally get the ball rolling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6023.787s">[Mustone]</a>: And this is long before you were here, Mr. Murphy, but I guess moving forward and Kathy and I can both speak from being on the building and grounds committee over the years, that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6034.856s">[Mustone]</a>: not administrators, teachers or staff members would complain of a building issue and it never was addressed until it seems like a parent came and then it was addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6046.561s">[Mustone]</a>: So I'm trying to figure out moving forward, how does the school committee, when we hear of these concerns, get the physical building concerns addressed without having to have a parent come out on a school night, take photocopies<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6061.775s">[Mustone]</a>: 18 pitches times the eight of us here to move forward on our physical structures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=32.775s">[Mustone]</a>: Mayor, Melanie is not here yet, do you want me to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=34.776s">[Mustone]</a>: I will call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=38.697s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=59.13s">[Mustone]</a>: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3673.819s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3675.98s">[Mustone]</a>: Nurse Avery, could students take a picture of their COVID vaccination card and just email it to your address or the school that, if it's middle school or a high schooler, like what's the best way to get it to you so you know who's vaccinated in our school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3689.506s">[Mustone]</a>: Something you can do when she gets home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3720.863s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay, just as you know, I have two middle schoolers and a high schooler, I'm okay with the vaccine being out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3726.508s">[Mustone]</a>: So if people aren't comfortable, a paper copy sent to the office with the nurse office on the envelope, or take a picture and email it to any school nurse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3737.139s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3739.581s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3739.981s">[Mustone]</a>: Member Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3885.593s">[Mustone]</a>: Member so I mean member of the stone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3889.295s">[Mustone]</a>: While we look for the executive director Paul you might know how long has Medford been in partnership with short collaborative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=68.597s">[Mustone]</a>: Dr. Maurice, I could change my name without your help tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=72.178s">[Mustone]</a>: After 18, how many months?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=75.098s">[Mustone]</a>: I couldn't figure it out myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=1038.507s">[Mustone]</a>: I think that's exactly it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=1040.088s">[Mustone]</a>: And Dr. Edouard-Vincent, I do want to say what I appreciate most is that you always see the best in everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=1049.712s">[Mustone]</a>: And you tap into that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=1051.173s">[Mustone]</a>: And that, I think, is why you have such a strong team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=1053.714s">[Mustone]</a>: And it's been a pleasure seeing you just really go for it here at Method.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=1058.896s">[Mustone]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=1148.09s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=3509.771s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=92.65s">[Mustone]</a>: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1994.219s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1995.32s">[Mustone]</a>: There are a number of seventh graders on Zoom, global scholars who have a petition for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2000.485s">[Mustone]</a>: So if there could be a suspension of the rules to have the students on Zoom make their petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2018.174s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11292.851s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12689.591s">[Mustone]</a>: Missituk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12772.133s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12960.505s">[Mustone]</a>: I believe on city Council when they have e-mails, they just put the name and address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12967.408s">[Mustone]</a>: I couldn't hear your motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15769.64s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15771.26s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19146.596s">[Mustone]</a>: But we've got other things, too, that we want on the yes or nos.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19150.479s">[Mustone]</a>: I'm just trying to figure out where they're available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1003.244s">[Mustone]</a>: I'm just changing my name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1007.848s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1008.248s">[Mustone]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=7009.681s">[Mustone]</a>: She put her finger up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=7010.762s">[Mustone]</a>: Oh, yes, I can unmute now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=7012.703s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=7018.187s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=7800.894s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes, thank you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=7802.837s">[Mustone]</a>: I appreciate Member Ruseau bringing this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=7805.3s">[Mustone]</a>: I do think it brings us to another point, which the parents on the line can probably relate, is that we still<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=7812.805s">[Mustone]</a>: fill out a paper copy of all of our information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=7816.287s">[Mustone]</a>: So I can remember a year that there was six forms for my medical, six forms for the emergency contact, six forms of my family biography.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=7825.912s">[Mustone]</a>: So I think that ties in because if we did all of that information online, we could just export the parent one, parent two, guardian one, guardian two, to be able to have it on a white list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=7841.06s">[Mustone]</a>: I think it's doable because I know if I email teachers from my Yahoo email, all the teachers can get it and Tegan, my sophomore, can get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=7849.166s">[Mustone]</a>: So it is something that we can handle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=7851.667s">[Mustone]</a>: So I do think, like Member Ruseau said, we did have a number of parents who said they're not at the point where they want to give their fourth grader a phone, but they do want to touch base during the day or put on a thread with the teacher about concerns of their child.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=7868.058s">[Mustone]</a>: So I guess mine is probably the a two-part to could we talk about getting all of our information online?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=7876.643s">[Mustone]</a>: You know there's family ID and Ravenna and all these school information sites that I think is an important step for us to move forward and I don't know if that should be an own motion or if we can tie it in but I definitely think we need to step up with our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=7897.428s">[Mustone]</a>: technology and family information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=7900.11s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8583.398s">[Mustone]</a>: Could a school information system possible quote be moved in as well with that motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8591.902s">[Mustone]</a>: I do think the papers, I just, in this day and age, the papers for the bus pass, the emergency contact, the, I don't know if it's called family biography or what the top of the one is, that it's teeny tiny lines and teeny tiny space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8611.272s">[Mustone]</a>: Um, but I think if we go to a school information system that the parents is more user friendly, so I'm not sure if that could be included to just quote some.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8620.341s">[Mustone]</a>: I know three offhand because I know other schools who use them, but I would appreciate if that could be included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8626.547s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8650.816s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8654.099s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=10039.153s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=10042.576s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=74.065s">[Mustone]</a>: What if we just, oh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=77.571s">[Mustone]</a>: Do you guys mind if I check my sound?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=79.273s">[Mustone]</a>: Can someone say hello?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=80.255s">[Mustone]</a>: Hi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=135.897s">[Mustone]</a>: I think we're all overtired in our house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=137.638s">[Mustone]</a>: We're all a little slap happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=3094.167s">[Mustone]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=3094.647s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=3095.688s">[Mustone]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=3097.18s">[Mustone]</a>: Mr. Murphy, correct me, because I'm getting all the budgets confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=3100.121s">[Mustone]</a>: For transportation, I saw that both Mr. Maloney talked about after school, late buses for middle school, Andrews and McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=3108.602s">[Mustone]</a>: And then also Mr. Textera mentioned to do something with the ELL students with the late bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=3115.103s">[Mustone]</a>: So is the transportation budget, have we not seen it yet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=3118.944s">[Mustone]</a>: Or is it the meeting I missed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=3178.321s">[Mustone]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=3178.862s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=3180.221s">[Mustone]</a>: And then the other question was, now I'm looking to, I'm sorry that, Paul or Mayor, you can ask someone else and I'll get back to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=3267.364s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2150.01s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2151.931s">[Mustone]</a>: Just two questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2154.671s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you guys all for all the information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2156.532s">[Mustone]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2157.592s">[Mustone]</a>: Schulman, I think it's a great idea about the school Councilor for the ELL students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2162.754s">[Mustone]</a>: I didn't know if 0.6 is enough for both middle school and high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2167.235s">[Mustone]</a>: If it was possible, that position could be increased.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2171.79s">[Mustone]</a>: Cause I do think it's probably a good idea to have a both a middle school and high school and to have someone who's just 0.6 try to go between three buildings would be a challenge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2182.472s">[Mustone]</a>: And then the next, and I'm not sure Mr. Murray, if it's the gym teacher, would that be under a different department?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2194.814s">[Mustone]</a>: We had talked about an adaptive gym teacher for the last, I wanna say at least two years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2201.12s">[Mustone]</a>: Um, so I, if that's a different department, I can hold it to another meeting, but I just want to get some clarity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2219.737s">[Mustone]</a>: And I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2220.757s">[Mustone]</a>: I did it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2221.338s">[Mustone]</a>: I said, Mr. Murray, because Colin's teacher is David Murray, who I see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2232.063s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4404.83s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4406.431s">[Mustone]</a>: Mr. Murphy, I don't know if it's possible for you to screen share page seven, which lists the superintendent's draft recommendations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4417.94s">[Mustone]</a>: That'd be great if you can do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4418.96s">[Mustone]</a>: So, superintendent, I love your recommendations because I think those are things that we have learned through community and teachers and parents that are necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4428.968s">[Mustone]</a>: For the page seven,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4433.956s">[Mustone]</a>: Is this the... That is the one, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4436.677s">[Mustone]</a>: So page seven, and now I'm gonna, sorry, Mr. Murphy, can you go to page eight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4443.818s">[Mustone]</a>: Just cause I was just highlighting what is in both the director's request and both the superintendent's direct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4452.02s">[Mustone]</a>: That's not the one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4461.068s">[Mustone]</a>: It's the one, it was in my package, page seven and then page eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4464.909s">[Mustone]</a>: So it's, I think it's the whole department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4469.77s">[Mustone]</a>: Um, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4475.052s">[Mustone]</a>: So at the top, so they pretty, I guess, I don't know if you can probably see mine, but it lines up except under the director's personnel priorities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4491.087s">[Mustone]</a>: So under the director's personnel priorities, it lists two, four, six, eight, 10, 11, 12, 13 bullets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4498.894s">[Mustone]</a>: All of the director's priorities are in the superintendent's recommendations except for the director's has three bullets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4509.344s">[Mustone]</a>: One is behavior specialist at four specialists,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4513.528s">[Mustone]</a>: One is a meet ETL position and one is an administrative assistant for the Curtis Tufts High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4519.831s">[Mustone]</a>: So they all sound like they are worthy priorities to be getting on the superintendent's recommendations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4528.915s">[Mustone]</a>: I wish I was tech savvy enough to show you just the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4533.081s">[Mustone]</a>: the two papers that I have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4535.282s">[Mustone]</a>: So I love the superintendent's recommendations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4537.583s">[Mustone]</a>: I'd love for us to make a motion to get them into the budget, but I do think it's important to add the three that didn't make it to the superintendent's recommendations that were on the director's personnel priorities, which is the behavior specialist, the meet ETL position, and the administrative assistant for the Curtis Tufts High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4556.449s">[Mustone]</a>: So I don't know if you know what I'm talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4559.99s">[Mustone]</a>: It was page seven and eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4561.828s">[Mustone]</a>: It's a Joan Bowen's report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4797.239s">[Mustone]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4797.62s">[Mustone]</a>: No, I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4798.581s">[Mustone]</a>: I don't know how all the schools and all the departments, their backstory to all of them, but I would, um, I do would like to make a motion that the superintendent's recommendations, cause those are the ones that you vetted more than the directors or the principals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4812.111s">[Mustone]</a>: Um, I would like to make a recommendation that we move forward to include the recommendations in the, in the budget, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4853.28s">[Mustone]</a>: I can, because I think, what is today, Thursday?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4855.921s">[Mustone]</a>: Did we meet on Tuesday?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4857.921s">[Mustone]</a>: And you had followed up with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4859.242s">[Mustone]</a>: So I am comfortable with making a motion that all four of the recommendation level priorities are included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=7141.189s">[Mustone]</a>: Very good, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=7142.55s">[Mustone]</a>: The motion was just that the superintendent's recommendations, the four levels are included in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=7151.477s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4603.262s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4604.883s">[Mustone]</a>: Mr. Murphy, I don't know if it's possible for you to share one of the slide decks that talks, has the superintendent's draft recommendations, any school, anyone, just so people know what I'm referring to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4617.57s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4621.05s">[Mustone]</a>: hard to get a visual or for me to explain it accurately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4629.217s">[Mustone]</a>: So you can just go to the first one you see that has the... Yeah, that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4634.702s">[Mustone]</a>: Where'd you go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4636.304s">[Mustone]</a>: Down further.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4637.405s">[Mustone]</a>: The one that lists critical FY22.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4638.906s">[Mustone]</a>: There we have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4641.208s">[Mustone]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4642.308s">[Mustone]</a>: So I just want to talk about this slide or this part of the budget, because it's for all the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4650.512s">[Mustone]</a>: And as people can see, it says critical FY and the example of textbooks and the next one long term budgetary priorities, literacy and math coach positions, which we all know are necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4662.036s">[Mustone]</a>: And then additional, like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4664.618s">[Mustone]</a>: said, the water filling and playground equipment, which we know is important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4668.263s">[Mustone]</a>: So, Mr. Murphy, I'm just wondering, because I understand that everything is so departmentalized here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4676.492s">[Mustone]</a>: So these numbers on the right were not in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4680.69s">[Mustone]</a>: this school's budget at the end of this part of this school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4683.931s">[Mustone]</a>: So are these line budget items going to be under a different department or are these something we would add to the end of this elementary ed budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4820.475s">[Mustone]</a>: So there's- Okay, just so I know how to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4826.296s">[Mustone]</a>: Building-based literacy and math.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4828.417s">[Mustone]</a>: Coaches are specialists or interventionists, whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4832.077s">[Mustone]</a>: Would that go under Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4834.978s">[Mustone]</a>: Kahn and the math department?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4836.558s">[Mustone]</a>: So then I just have to make a mental note when Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4838.838s">[Mustone]</a>: Kahn presents to make sure there's math<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4842.835s">[Mustone]</a>: specialist in there or do I just make a note when we go through it at the end to make sure there's literacy and math specialist?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4850.821s">[Mustone]</a>: I just, I love the superintendent's recommendations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4854.283s">[Mustone]</a>: I think the critical ones are a definite and the long-term budgetatory priorities are a definite.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4860.628s">[Mustone]</a>: So I just wanna figure out how I can work with everyone to make sure at least those two top portions of the recommendations make it at the end of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4991.654s">[Mustone]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4991.815s">[Mustone]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4992.597s">[Mustone]</a>: Could you scroll up for a minute just to another slide above this one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=4997.872s">[Mustone]</a>: Just, nope, one more up, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5000.614s">[Mustone]</a>: Just right here, just for parents and community members, because I was confused when I read this this morning, where you have grade levels pre-K to five, budget FTEs 28, actual FTEs 82.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5014.006s">[Mustone]</a>: Could you explain that to our community members?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5017.148s">[Mustone]</a>: Because I had no idea what the heck that meant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5096.585s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5097.646s">[Mustone]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5098.486s">[Mustone]</a>: I'm good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5099.146s">[Mustone]</a>: I have no more questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5100.066s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=6842.962s">[Mustone]</a>: Just because we're coming up, it's 8.56, I would, just because things move quickly and items are added or items are discarded, could I make a motion that at least the top two parts of the superintendent's recommendations are included<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=6860.735s">[Mustone]</a>: in the right budget, whether it's under special education or transportation or math department or elementary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=6869.242s">[Mustone]</a>: So under it would be the critical FY22 budgetary priorities, and then the next group, the long-term budgetary priorities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=6885.853s">[Mustone]</a>: So it's really, it's the summary at the end of each school that shows the superintendent's recommendations and it's by priority level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=6894.543s">[Mustone]</a>: So I think the first two priority levels are definitely necessities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=6900.67s">[Mustone]</a>: There's a third that says additional budgetary priorities worthy of consideration that I think we can consider at a later time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=6907.793s">[Mustone]</a>: And then it's COVID mitigation priorities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=6909.713s">[Mustone]</a>: So there's a recommendation for each school, but I would just<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=6915.595s">[Mustone]</a>: like to see the top two levels included under the right department or grade level just because I think the superintendent has listened to us over the past year and knows this is what the community has shared with us and teachers have shared with us and these are things that are necessary to move our children forward in September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=2181.052s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=2181.732s">[Mustone]</a>: Good evening, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=2183.617s">[Mustone]</a>: Our personnel and budget committee, we had member Van der Kloot and member Kreatz present, and our assistant superintendent, Mr. Murray, shared our dates for the upcoming budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=2195.564s">[Mustone]</a>: So I don't know if we can screen share the dates so people can see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=2200.766s">[Mustone]</a>: And Mr. Murphy, I'm sorry, Collins teachers, Mr. David Murray, and you have Mr. David Murphy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=2206.369s">[Mustone]</a>: I always confuse the two of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=2208.01s">[Mustone]</a>: No problem at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=2212.873s">[Mustone]</a>: So we went through the dates in the process for budget season, which will be upon us sooner than later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=2221.075s">[Mustone]</a>: And this is just for people to make notes of when they would like to tune in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=2226.917s">[Mustone]</a>: We have not set an exact time yet, just waiting for everyone's schedules to be consolidated so we can see what time is best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=2237.6s">[Mustone]</a>: Mr. Murphy, I don't know if you have anything to add about under each topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=2243.13s">[Mustone]</a>: they encompass more than everything that's listed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=2310.593s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=2311.093s">[Mustone]</a>: Member McLaughlin, I'm not sure if I call on you because it's the building subcommittee, or Maya, do you call on Member McLaughlin?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=2319.056s">[Mustone]</a>: Member McLaughlin, sorry, Member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=0.111s">[Mustone]</a>: Governor's March 15, 2020 order imposing strict limitations on the number of people that may gather in one place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=69.341s">[Mustone]</a>: Member Kreatz?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=70.642s">[Mustone]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=71.683s">[Mustone]</a>: Member Van der Kloot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=72.844s">[Mustone]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=73.624s">[Mustone]</a>: Member Mustone, I am here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=75.586s">[Mustone]</a>: And now to move on to the agenda, we have one item on the agenda regarding the budget hearings and dates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=83.472s">[Mustone]</a>: So I will turn it over to Mr. Murphy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=353.947s">[Mustone]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=355.127s">[Mustone]</a>: Sorry, I'm calling one of my kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=719.92s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=720.941s">[Mustone]</a>: And a parent in the chat did ask if there'd be an opportunity for public comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=726.043s">[Mustone]</a>: So Mr. Andre Hina, if you would like to speak, we are happy to hear your comment or question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=743.458s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=970.258s">[Mustone]</a>: Just for the record, could you state your address and it can be registered?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=978.46s">[Mustone]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=979.361s">[Mustone]</a>: I do appreciate what you said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=981.322s">[Mustone]</a>: I do see Paulette's hand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=983.884s">[Mustone]</a>: Member van de Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1043.893s">[Mustone]</a>: And I also, Mr. Murphy, and I was just gonna ask you and you might know the answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1047.754s">[Mustone]</a>: I do think this is a longer conversation to come up with some solutions or remedies for, because as Mr. Kena said, it has been an ongoing issue after school program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1062.097s">[Mustone]</a>: So I'm not sure if that would be what subcommittee it would fall under to have a more robust conversation than under this budget scheduling meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1264.103s">[Mustone]</a>: Member van de Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1291.704s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay, all right, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1294.445s">[Mustone]</a>: Are there any other community members who would like to speak or have any questions about our budget schedule?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1307.765s">[Mustone]</a>: So Mr. Murphy, I imagine we'll either move it to a subcommittee or a committee of the whole, but what night would afterschool program fall under?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1316.891s">[Mustone]</a>: Would it be under elementary ed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1328.638s">[Mustone]</a>: The central office?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1343.168s">[Mustone]</a>: May 12th, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1344.168s">[Mustone]</a>: So for folks about afterschool program, I don't wanna make any promises, but hopefully we can either move it to a subcommittee or a committee of the whole before May 12th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1356.67s">[Mustone]</a>: And then May 12th would be when Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1359.191s">[Mustone]</a>: Megan Fidler-Carey would be presenting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1392.592s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1405.383s">[Mustone]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1406.264s">[Mustone]</a>: So I'm just trying to think of the subcommittees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1413.07s">[Mustone]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1413.27s">[Mustone]</a>: Kreatz, your buildings and grounds, what else do you have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1419.782s">[Mustone]</a>: What other two do you, and you sit on personnel and budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1422.044s">[Mustone]</a>: Personnel, yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1430.853s">[Mustone]</a>: And then Paulette, what are the three you are on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1432.695s">[Mustone]</a>: Curriculum, this one, and...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1528.06s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1605.549s">[Mustone]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1606.209s">[Mustone]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1606.469s">[Mustone]</a>: So I think what's, oh, all right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1608.411s">[Mustone]</a>: Member Kreatz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1715.563s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you, Member Kreatz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1717.523s">[Mustone]</a>: I think at this point, we'll have to work with Dr. Maurice and see if we'll either have it on the agenda for, I don't imagine it can be on this Monday, March 22nd, maybe our first meeting in April.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1730.746s">[Mustone]</a>: I'll call a committee of the whole about it and I can make sure to reach out to Mr. Kina to give the date and it will obviously be published.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1740.588s">[Mustone]</a>: And member Van der Kloot, I see your hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1887.482s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1889.464s">[Mustone]</a>: Any final questions or comments?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1893.564s">[Mustone]</a>: Member Kreatz?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2043.912s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you, Member Kreatz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2141.067s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2143.207s">[Mustone]</a>: Are there any other comments or questions regarding the budget schedule for April and May?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2149.609s">[Mustone]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2152.929s">[Mustone]</a>: I think that's all that was on the agenda to get through the process and the dates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2159.17s">[Mustone]</a>: Would anyone like to make a motion to adjourn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2198.228s">[Mustone]</a>: I'll make that motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2199.589s">[Mustone]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2199.87s">[Mustone]</a>: And I'll second it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2200.911s">[Mustone]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2202.232s">[Mustone]</a>: I'll take a roll call for the motion to send the dates to the full committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2206.235s">[Mustone]</a>: Member Kreatz?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2208.417s">[Mustone]</a>: Member Van der Kloot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2209.578s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2210.219s">[Mustone]</a>: Member Mastone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2211.14s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2211.48s">[Mustone]</a>: We'll send the dates to the full committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2215.164s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2229.538s">[Mustone]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2230.119s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2232.582s">[Mustone]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2234.605s">[Mustone]</a>: Now, member Vanden Heuvel, did you have a motion to adjourn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2237.369s">[Mustone]</a>: I have a motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2239.611s">[Mustone]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2241.907s">[Mustone]</a>: And I'll take a roll call to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2243.792s">[Mustone]</a>: Member Kreatz?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2245.576s">[Mustone]</a>: Member Van der Kloot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2246.879s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2247.5s">[Mustone]</a>: Member Mustone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2248.342s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2249.124s">[Mustone]</a>: Well, thank you all for joining us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2252.933s">[Mustone]</a>: Oh, happy St.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=2253.574s">[Mustone]</a>: Patrick's Day for tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8770.601s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes, I also signed on to the resolution with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8773.513s">[Mustone]</a>: Member Ruseau and Member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8777.054s">[Mustone]</a>: And I want to say the reason why we proposed it is because as we've learned of Columbus's legacy in recent times with more research and history, we realized that is not someone that we would like to hold up in a standard for our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8792.82s">[Mustone]</a>: Most people know I have six children, four in Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8796.801s">[Mustone]</a>: He is not someone that I want my children to think that's who we want to represent a school in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8805.284s">[Mustone]</a>: We've heard a lot of conversation on both sides tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8809.366s">[Mustone]</a>: I've had personal conversation with a number of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8811.987s">[Mustone]</a>: I have thought about it thoroughly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8814.328s">[Mustone]</a>: And I know that there are many other opportunities to name a school and that we're not erasing history.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8825.094s">[Mustone]</a>: It's that he is not someone that represents what I wanna teach my children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8830.358s">[Mustone]</a>: I agree that he was a navigator, but other than that, there's nothing that I wanna encourage my children to say, this is someone that we admire and someone that I want you to look up to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8842.367s">[Mustone]</a>: So I think that's how I agreed with my family discussing it that I signed on with Mr. Russo and Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8849.232s">[Mustone]</a>: McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8850.413s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17786.751s">[Mustone]</a>: That'd be a big committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18155.394s">[Mustone]</a>: I did not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18160.772s">[Mustone]</a>: Sorry, I just, I mean, I can see that if they get many names, I know with all the emails we got, I would say we probably were maybe 30 to 40 names were suggested in the emails we received over the last nine months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18179.718s">[Mustone]</a>: So then this is opened up to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18182.975s">[Mustone]</a>: I wonder if it will be a large number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18184.896s">[Mustone]</a>: So no, I mean on the advisory committee, how many, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18188.737s">[Mustone]</a>: If we're thinking about how much work they each have to do, they each get divvied up 40 names each to just, you know, Google their name and see what their story is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18195.94s">[Mustone]</a>: Um, so probably 20.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20730.677s">[Mustone]</a>: Sure, thank you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20736.141s">[Mustone]</a>: For number 15, if the advisory committee recommends a timeline change, which I hear what Kathy's saying, for the time crunch it is now, could it be that in the meantime, that we will refer to the Columbus School with the temporary name of the South Medford Elementary School?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20760.765s">[Mustone]</a>: So then it feels like we're moving forward, it's temporary, but if an extension is asked, if the advisory committee asked for an extension at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20899.039s">[Mustone]</a>: No, I mean, my heart is with the Mystic, but for this process, I think just to be able to move forward with a temporary name while the advisory committee asks for more time, the South Medford Elementary School buys us more time with also recognizing that we are no longer honoring Columbus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1636.298s">[Mustone]</a>: That's Member Mustone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1640.703s">[Mustone]</a>: Thanks, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1641.963s">[Mustone]</a>: Dr. Maurice, I just want to say I thought it was very telling that you scored so high on ethics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1648.205s">[Mustone]</a>: And I think that's what really shows the community or the community already sees it, that you are such a respectable or you respect others, you're respectable, you are open minded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1662.37s">[Mustone]</a>: You listen, you think about right and wrong, and you really work together with your team and with the families and the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1669.773s">[Mustone]</a>: And I was glad to see that ethical number, because I really do think you're one of the most justice-centered person I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1679.677s">[Mustone]</a>: So thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=2219.76s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=226.261s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=3665.146s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=3712.487s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=3749.671s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4111.976s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9397.857s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9400.024s">[Mustone]</a>: I am the chair of the personnel and budget committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9402.965s">[Mustone]</a>: So I think my understanding was that the personnel and budget committee would come up with the dates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9408.808s">[Mustone]</a>: And I do think because in recent past practice, it has been committee of the holes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9414.17s">[Mustone]</a>: that probably this year they should be committee of the wholes we would just set the date and the plan on the personnel and budget committee and then moving forward if that's more of how school committees um generally do it it's it's just past practice here that it's been committee of the whole so i think for this year for people to understand the process it would be the personnel and budget committee just to set<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9437.295s">[Mustone]</a>: who we're hearing on what days, and then have committee of the wholes for all the sessions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9442.219s">[Mustone]</a>: And then next year, talk about having a different budget process that's more streamlined and more community focused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9450.466s">[Mustone]</a>: And I'm happy to hear how other districts do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9453.889s">[Mustone]</a>: I think just in my experience for the last five years, or four years, this is how we've done it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9458.834s">[Mustone]</a>: So I hope that's a compromise that we can work with this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9462.157s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12114.193s">[Mustone]</a>: I was gonna say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12116.982s">[Mustone]</a>: I've been to four high school graduations since coming on the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12122.098s">[Mustone]</a>: And I believe it's only one time that a student was recognized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12124.839s">[Mustone]</a>: And I have to say, I was more impressed with that student than the other awards given, because I don't think it's a matter of kids being sick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12133.421s">[Mustone]</a>: Because I think I would say 99%, when my kids stay home, they're not sick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12138.742s">[Mustone]</a>: They just want to have a day to stay home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12140.943s">[Mustone]</a>: So I don't think we can assume that kids are sick who are perfect attendants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12145.524s">[Mustone]</a>: And I do think it's something that the community<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12149.465s">[Mustone]</a>: respects of these students, their dedication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12151.726s">[Mustone]</a>: I hear everything you're saying, Paul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12154.488s">[Mustone]</a>: But I do think we need to hear from the parents of the students, because we're not hearing everyone's voice about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12162.793s">[Mustone]</a>: We're hearing, I think, a lot of the cons of it, I guess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12168.516s">[Mustone]</a>: And I mean, I've only seen it once in four years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12171.458s">[Mustone]</a>: So I don't think kids are struggling through the flu to make it to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12174.82s">[Mustone]</a>: I think between just having<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12179.613s">[Mustone]</a>: good, I guess, good immune system and a good dedication to school that they're there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12185.018s">[Mustone]</a>: I think that it was really something commendable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12188.962s">[Mustone]</a>: I think the high school community really thought that student was deserving of it because I just, for my own kids, I know that 99% of the time they're not going to school because they're sick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12202.596s">[Mustone]</a>: Um, and so I think I am with the mayor with, I think a conversation is still an important thing with the whole community at the rules and regulations about it so we can hear from other parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3731.869s">[Mustone]</a>: I know it's short notice, but if there's any way you could do a reverse call, because I think that's a great information that parents shouldn't, I was planning on going in with Nevin and Rowan to the Andrews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3743.173s">[Mustone]</a>: So I think that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3744.013s">[Mustone]</a>: If someone could put out a call that grade six through 12, the parents can wait in their car.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3748.872s">[Mustone]</a>: just because of the numbers in the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=3751.133s">[Mustone]</a>: I don't know if that's too short notice to get a call out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=884.085s">[Mustone]</a>: And Paul, you're right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=886.006s">[Mustone]</a>: I think it was, well, now looking back, it was an oversight, because it was kind of Kathy and I transitioning, and Kathy was really the one who thought of a vision committee, and that's when she came on as chair of the buildings committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=899.934s">[Mustone]</a>: So really, Kathy, I don't know if you, you probably remember better than I do, because it was the vocational teacher who had come up and has presented when the buildings committee, I think it was the last meeting we transitioned together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=14797.074s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=14797.655s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=14798.435s">[Mustone]</a>: I just wanted to suggest, and you might already be doing it, Dr. Maurice, but could this be emailed through the different principals on the elementary level and the middle school levels directly to their school community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=14811.085s">[Mustone]</a>: Because I think when parents receive emails from the district, and I'll speak for myself, sometimes I don't read them all, because I think it's a lot of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=14818.912s">[Mustone]</a>: But if I get one from Mr. Johnson or Mr. Downs, and I know it's specific to my kids' grades, I'll read it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=14825.077s">[Mustone]</a>: So maybe if it was the end of the slide deck was a suggestion about just getting it out there on social media or maybe on the Medford Public Schools Facebook page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=14834.425s">[Mustone]</a>: But I think an email from principals, because parents trust most of our principals,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=14840.535s">[Mustone]</a>: that it's a resource that can be used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=14842.476s">[Mustone]</a>: And I think this is the time that parents, oh, Tegan's telling me I'm talking too long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=14848.377s">[Mustone]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=14848.897s">[Mustone]</a>: Tegan, leave her alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=292.807s">[Mustone]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=335.67s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=949.659s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4310.277s">[Mustone]</a>: Member Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11258.72s">[Mustone]</a>: Member Mustone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11259.4s">[Mustone]</a>: That's what I was going to suggest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11260.561s">[Mustone]</a>: Because I know you're at the wire on Friday night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11262.962s">[Mustone]</a>: But I think even if they're uploaded by 5 o'clock on Monday, people can check it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11268.684s">[Mustone]</a>: have it with them when they're on their phone here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=1727.129s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay, thanks Miss Ray for all this information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=1730.971s">[Mustone]</a>: It is really impressive all the work that nurses do and it seems like it almost is that a caseworker is needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=1739.214s">[Mustone]</a>: Excuse me, so when there's a vision screening and you send the referral letter, is there, I know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=1745.894s">[Mustone]</a>: Is there a follow-up to say, you got the referral letter, but did you actually go to the eye doctor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=1770.464s">[Mustone]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=1770.664s">[Mustone]</a>: And that's time consuming when they have kids waiting in their office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=1774.487s">[Mustone]</a>: And even with, um, at the Curtis Tufts, when students want to go for management techniques, how do you have any idea of how many students a day go or how long they stay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=1811.102s">[Mustone]</a>: And as the state mandates more and more on your department, do you think, is there a new profession for caseworkers in the nursing office?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=1819.846s">[Mustone]</a>: That's all encompassed within our role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=1851.865s">[Mustone]</a>: So I guess we can wait till budget meetings, but it'd be that you would be hiring more nurses to take on all the casework.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=1858.248s">[Mustone]</a>: Possibly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=1858.628s">[Mustone]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=1859.289s">[Mustone]</a>: No, I mean, it's incredible all the work they do at all the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=1862.83s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2575.293s">[Mustone]</a>: The only question is, it seemed like all of them increased in a positive number except for the Columbus and Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/l7UJNCM5bg4&t=2585.499s">[Mustone]</a>: Could you look at it in more depth and if there was anything that you could see that you can address to make sure they go up next year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2032.4s">[Mustone]</a>: All those present, none absent, please all rise to salute our flag.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=2052.01s">[Mustone]</a>: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3793.779s">[Mustone]</a>: I'm excited to hear about the two bathrooms, obviously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3796.301s">[Mustone]</a>: My ninth grader, Teagan,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3798.252s">[Mustone]</a>: shares with Joey's concerns on a regular basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3801.313s">[Mustone]</a>: And I'm wondering if there's a way, if there's any surplus in the budget, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3805.875s">[Mustone]</a>: Patterson, if it would be cost effective to try to do four bathrooms if we're having a contracting company in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3812.798s">[Mustone]</a>: And I think it's, I'm glad we're trying to do two at a time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3817.648s">[Mustone]</a>: But from what I hear, all 16 need to be done now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=3820.891s">[Mustone]</a>: So I'm wondering if there's a way we can put our brains together to see if there's more free cash, or if there's a surplus at the end, or if this can be a priority in our budget hearings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4991.178s">[Mustone]</a>: Oh, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4992.56s">[Mustone]</a>: Perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RCBmbH4HOvE&t=4998.666s">[Mustone]</a>: Nice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2554.211s">[Mustone]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6067.957s">[Mustone]</a>: This is hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6070.279s">[Mustone]</a>: You know, we were at home and I was saying to my kids, what will I say?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6075.243s">[Mustone]</a>: Because we weren't thinking we would be saying something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6080.255s">[Mustone]</a>: Teagan told me, well, you met her through the whole food security interest with the Greater Boston Food Bank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6088.465s">[Mustone]</a>: And that was the first time we actually had a conversation after the first election four years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6093.252s">[Mustone]</a>: And we met with Carol Tynken from Greater Boston Food Bank and talked about making Metfed the first food secure<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6099.479s">[Mustone]</a>: City in the Commonwealth and that is still a goal that we're working at but it's with your help over the last few years that we have now a food pantry at the high school the summer eats program with the YMCA We've done pop-up mobile food markets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6113.044s">[Mustone]</a>: We have Columbus groceries and soon there'll be a community food pantry That'll be very exciting that you were behind making that community food pantry happen and I guess what Paul was saying that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6129.496s">[Mustone]</a>: You always had the children, and even Reptonado, you always had the residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6134.319s">[Mustone]</a>: You always thought of them first, and how can you make their life on a daily basis better?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6138.121s">[Mustone]</a>: And I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6139.481s">[Mustone]</a>: And the benefit was that because of food security, we got to be good friends, and I look forward to having more guidance and great conversations with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=6213.24s">[Mustone]</a>: Mayor Burke?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6127.049s">[Mustone]</a>: Megan, you probably want to sit down after all these questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6131.71s">[Mustone]</a>: The process to apply, I know that, I guess, a year and a half ago, people showed up at the office and waited and see if you were lucky enough to be first in line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6142.352s">[Mustone]</a>: How did it go this past sign up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6148.033s">[Mustone]</a>: Oh, so this is the first time to try.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6149.634s">[Mustone]</a>: So what is the plan for the new system?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6199.669s">[Mustone]</a>: It will still be the first come first serve, like who's ever sleeps over outside the Columbus school or?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6251.739s">[Mustone]</a>: Do you have a question which has come up now at least for two years?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6254.741s">[Mustone]</a>: Is this your third year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6255.861s">[Mustone]</a>: No, second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6256.562s">[Mustone]</a>: Second year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6257.002s">[Mustone]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6257.302s">[Mustone]</a>: So maybe it's only come up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6258.383s">[Mustone]</a>: Well, I think it came up before you were appointed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6261.404s">[Mustone]</a>: The budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6262.505s">[Mustone]</a>: So we've heard that everyone pays in a system, but you don't get to see what the program brings in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6268.568s">[Mustone]</a>: And then you do pay for the snacks and the crafts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6271.631s">[Mustone]</a>: So are you now able to see your whole spreadsheet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6289.825s">[Mustone]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6290.066s">[Mustone]</a>: What made me think of it was because the wage is going to go up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6293.548s">[Mustone]</a>: So that's going to be a bump in your wages or your salary line item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6297.872s">[Mustone]</a>: And then will that, is that already planned for uncovered for,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6301.078s">[Mustone]</a>: with what you bring in in tuition?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3653.565s">[Mustone]</a>: I just wanted to ask, so usually when something's too good to be true, it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3657.646s">[Mustone]</a>: So with Lexia letting us use it for free, does that mean in June we have to budget for $500,000 for this program?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3707.372s">[Mustone]</a>: And then what's dibbles per student?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3723.959s">[Mustone]</a>: »» Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3724.62s">[Mustone]</a>: So they are screeners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3737.0s">[Mustone]</a>: So are we looking at them together then, or are we looking at them separately?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3763.256s">[Mustone]</a>: So does DIBL and MAP?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3765.586s">[Mustone]</a>: and Rapid sell an intervention program like Lexia does?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3775.61s">[Mustone]</a>: I'm just wondering, are we choosing it because it's free, or are we choosing it because it's the best option for the screeners?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3808.026s">[Mustone]</a>: So I guess if the trial is for the year, and hopefully we learn which kids need the intervention, and then we will be looking then to use their intervention, the core five, then we do have to budget for $40 a student per year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3824.69s">[Mustone]</a>: for this program if this is what we use?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3850.049s">[Mustone]</a>: Right, and I guess, I'm sorry I'm being cynical, and I owe that to Paul, because he says there's big money in education, and he's right, because he made me read a book about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3860.619s">[Mustone]</a>: So I guess I'm just doubtful that, what is, is Lexia, is this really the best option out there, or do they market themselves so well, and give it to people for a year for free, that we end up thinking it's the best and we use it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3906.594s">[Mustone]</a>: And I'm not even being cynical just with the state of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3908.695s">[Mustone]</a>: I'm being cynical with the Department of Ed of Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3954.278s">[Mustone]</a>: And then with the core five for the intervention,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3957.273s">[Mustone]</a>: Is that, would that bring on more staff, or you are saying the classroom teacher would be the interventionist using the core five?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3963.196s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3969.36s">[Mustone]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3970.58s">[Mustone]</a>: OK, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6543.809s">[Mustone]</a>: My question was similar to Paul's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6545.89s">[Mustone]</a>: So we just take their word from their RFP that they pay their employees a living wage?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6551.946s">[Mustone]</a>: A fair living wage?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6553.086s">[Mustone]</a>: They don't say we pay our employees minimum wage?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6583.629s">[Mustone]</a>: Could they look at it again to make sure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6592.396s">[Mustone]</a>: So when future RFPs for cleaning, can we put in the language that they use for contractor RFPs that we make sure that there is a living wage included in the RFP?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6634.068s">[Mustone]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6634.368s">[Mustone]</a>: And I know you didn't ask, so you wouldn't have the answer, but moving forward,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6671.065s">[Mustone]</a>: Right, but it sounds like we didn't ask that question in the current RFP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6673.686s">[Mustone]</a>: So that's what I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6674.527s">[Mustone]</a>: Moving forward, can we put in the RFP that you provide whether it's a minimum wage or a living wage<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6681.724s">[Mustone]</a>: But I mean, on a daily basis, we hear about how the cost of living in the city of Medford, no one can afford it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6688.149s">[Mustone]</a>: So it seems like we should be doing our part to have people who are working in our schools be able to have a living wage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6694.934s">[Mustone]</a>: I'll get off my soapbox.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2302.944s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2303.304s">[Mustone]</a>: I was going to ask if Member Van der Kloot would amend her motion to send it to the policy subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2310.572s">[Mustone]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2310.992s">[Mustone]</a>: Could I make?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3080.814s">[Mustone]</a>: So I will not read the report and hope I can't do the highlights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3085.055s">[Mustone]</a>: Our agenda, five items that were discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3088.716s">[Mustone]</a>: The first was speed bumps at the high school complex.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3093.117s">[Mustone]</a>: I have emailed the chief of police and John Laughlin, our building manager, facilities manager, and they are looking into it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3102.84s">[Mustone]</a>: Second was the flashing speed signs that you see throughout the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3111.88s">[Mustone]</a>: telling us what speed we're going, if it is below the speed limit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3115.462s">[Mustone]</a>: Those are all being used throughout the city, but when one frees up, it will go to the high school complex.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3123.407s">[Mustone]</a>: The third was an update on the Andrew Glenn complex.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3126.869s">[Mustone]</a>: As of today, the sidewalks and curbing has been completed, and there's just some detailing work that needs to be finished.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3135.976s">[Mustone]</a>: Number four was regarding the school kitchen appliances, and that really stemmed from the desire to not use styrofoam plates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3146.905s">[Mustone]</a>: Rhetta Smith, the school nutritionist, did take an inventory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3150.348s">[Mustone]</a>: We do have many appliances throughout the school kitchens that need updating or repair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3158.355s">[Mustone]</a>: led us to a conversation with Alicia Hunt, who's the energy coordinator for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3162.297s">[Mustone]</a>: Kathy Kreatz and I will be meeting with her and some state officials to discuss possible grant applications to update our school kitchen appliances and other ways to be green in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3179.009s">[Mustone]</a>: The last item of our agenda was the Medford High School master plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3183.372s">[Mustone]</a>: And Mr. Brown, a teacher at the vocational high school,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3187.932s">[Mustone]</a>: gave us a report from his perspective as both a teacher and a citizen, and what is the plan for Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3197.38s">[Mustone]</a>: His questions really led us to discuss, is it about rehabbing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3204.646s">[Mustone]</a>: Is it about looking for funding to build new?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3208.349s">[Mustone]</a>: Is it about doing it in phases?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3212.552s">[Mustone]</a>: And Kathy Kreatz had<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3214.781s">[Mustone]</a>: suggested that we make a subcommittee that would almost be a master vision plan for the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3221.964s">[Mustone]</a>: So I would like to make a motion to create a subcommittee on a master vision for the high school repair and maintenance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3236.511s">[Mustone]</a>: And what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3240.173s">[Mustone]</a>: Vision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3240.813s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3720.712s">[Mustone]</a>: To clarify, I think it evolved from our typical subcommittee, our eight subcommittees, to now more of a committee like the superintendent search where community members are involved, teachers are involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3734.338s">[Mustone]</a>: It won't be three of the standing school committee members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3737.74s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3873.106s">[Mustone]</a>: Can I just ask out of the six of us who are interested in being on the Master Vision Plan Committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3877.887s">[Mustone]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3881.628s">[Mustone]</a>: So Paulette, Erin, Michael, and Kathy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3886.768s">[Mustone]</a>: They'll keep us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5821.509s">[Mustone]</a>: Do you have something?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5823.21s">[Mustone]</a>: I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5823.611s">[Mustone]</a>: OK, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5825.112s">[Mustone]</a>: Diane, I have one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5831.876s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes, I just spoke with Mr. Delay because someone else had asked about a breakdown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5836.74s">[Mustone]</a>: So when the sophomore class currently at the high school is 150 enrolled in CTE and 170 in the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5844.926s">[Mustone]</a>: And that was the only class that someone had asked me about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5851.29s">[Mustone]</a>: Oh, sorry, I do have that 207 in ninth grade in CTE and 122 in high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7215.483s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=7216.644s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=415.431s">[Mustone]</a>: I'm not speaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=453.099s">[Mustone]</a>: Is there a motion to approve the minutes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=458.604s">[Mustone]</a>: Is there a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=612.648s">[Mustone]</a>: Member Di Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=613.489s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=616.273s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=639.952s">[Mustone]</a>: And the mayor's going to do it when she comes back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1253.281s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes, I make a motion to accept the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1256.281s">[Mustone]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2454.712s">[Mustone]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2483.299s">[Mustone]</a>: Vanden Heuvel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3939.989s">[Mustone]</a>: I want to thank Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3940.989s">[Mustone]</a>: Patterson and the superintendent, because we have been talking about breakfast in the schools for three and a half years, and this is the first time that a compromise, it's not what our wish list is, but it's a beginning, and it can expand, and we can grow it, and the word is getting out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3955.721s">[Mustone]</a>: So I truly appreciate your compromise right here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3958.063s">[Mustone]</a>: So I vote also to approve this report of universal free breakfast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4494.598s">[Mustone]</a>: I thought she was stretching.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4496.679s">[Mustone]</a>: I need to stretch too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4498.279s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you Melanie and Tanya for an excellent slide show.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4502.56s">[Mustone]</a>: I was wondering, and I'm not sure if it's Kathy or you folks that can answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4505.641s">[Mustone]</a>: So your slide says 770 kids on an IEP, but then our hard copy is 888.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4510.503s">[Mustone]</a>: That's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4516.72s">[Mustone]</a>: But to increase by 118, is that an average for the beginning and the end of a school year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4574.241s">[Mustone]</a>: I guess my concern or question, thinking of budgeting, is do you see a higher than average increase in the last few years of kids on IEPs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4592.449s">[Mustone]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4611.985s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay, all right, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5502.537s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5503.377s">[Mustone]</a>: I just want to share a conversation I had with one of my children's teachers at the Roberts because the assessment was on our last agenda that we were just talking about what the report was about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5516.0s">[Mustone]</a>: Like, what was the backstory?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5518.061s">[Mustone]</a>: We wanted to know about all the assessments taking place, how much instruction time is lost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5522.362s">[Mustone]</a>: What I didn't know, which I thought is helpful for parents to know, is that at least for the math benchmarks, the student takes it on their Chromebook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5531.823s">[Mustone]</a>: The results of the test or the benchmark are all downloaded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5536.044s">[Mustone]</a>: Then the math coach at the Roberts receives it all and can see where the needs are and what's missing or what needs to be highlighted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5543.226s">[Mustone]</a>: And then the math coach met with the teacher to review<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5546.313s">[Mustone]</a>: So at least I can only speak about math because I only had 10 minutes, you know, at drop-off to talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5552.437s">[Mustone]</a>: So I do think, I guess I never thought assessments went anywhere except they filled them out and they were filed somewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5558.421s">[Mustone]</a>: But the math coach is at least looking at the math part, so that is direct service to see how they can help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5916.843s">[Mustone]</a>: I have a point, just for clarification, if Dr. Cobb, so out of the nine screenings that you had said that you would recommend to us, out of the 90 screenings that are available, is this one of them, the Shaywitz?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5930.715s">[Mustone]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5931.195s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=895.151s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2329.223s">[Mustone]</a>: Mia?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2330.563s">[Mustone]</a>: I don't know if it's Mr. Squawford because it's the elementary school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2334.964s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2335.904s">[Mustone]</a>: For the elementary, is this my honor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2340.695s">[Mustone]</a>: For the elementary schools, can you tell us how many kids are in each of the elementary school programs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2346.619s">[Mustone]</a>: And for the McGlynn as well, and even for the high school, because I'm sure your high school numbers have grown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2373.062s">[Mustone]</a>: Columbus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2433.302s">[Mustone]</a>: And did you say the Curtis Tufts is starting one or has one currently?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2440.705s">[Mustone]</a>: Oh, that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2443.906s">[Mustone]</a>: So the Cummings Grant that funds this, is that running its course?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2466.653s">[Mustone]</a>: And is there an option to renew with Cummings?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2502.811s">[Mustone]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2503.372s">[Mustone]</a>: Mr. Skorka, do you, I mean, I feel like I see you at a lot of events.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2509.68s">[Mustone]</a>: What would be the idea?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2510.621s">[Mustone]</a>: Would it be a full-time job to be the director of this program?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2518.044s">[Mustone]</a>: You're up here, Rich, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2519.104s">[Mustone]</a>: I'm the administrator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2523.366s">[Mustone]</a>: You're the administrator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2524.527s">[Mustone]</a>: But in the schools, meaning with the kids and you supervise all the coordinators?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2529.369s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes, that is correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2531.77s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2532.89s">[Mustone]</a>: A year, it would be horrible if we let this go, and a year if there's no funding from Cummings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2539.107s">[Mustone]</a>: Is there a plan after year three?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2551.071s">[Mustone]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2551.251s">[Mustone]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2553.271s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3696.266s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3696.626s">[Mustone]</a>: There's a lot going on over here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5781.871s">[Mustone]</a>: A little light that I have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5784.272s">[Mustone]</a>: I had spoken to the chief of police last Friday because parents at the Roberts had just talked to me while I was at school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5792.455s">[Mustone]</a>: And when I spoke to him on Friday, he said the man was in custody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5798.157s">[Mustone]</a>: He was being held until today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5799.918s">[Mustone]</a>: And today he was being arraigned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5802.039s">[Mustone]</a>: And I do not have an update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5804.0s">[Mustone]</a>: And the chief<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5805.439s">[Mustone]</a>: thought he could possibly get a 30 or a 60-day psych evaluation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5811.164s">[Mustone]</a>: So hopefully, there'll be an email when I get home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5813.225s">[Mustone]</a>: But the police are very on top of it and want to make sure the Roberts parents know that they are following it very closely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5821.032s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5869.006s">[Mustone]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5869.106s">[Mustone]</a>: Kahn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=11348.846s">[Mustone]</a>: Sorry, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=11350.587s">[Mustone]</a>: I was surprised at what the fourth graders are expected to do with the technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=11355.29s">[Mustone]</a>: Does the computer teacher at the elementary schools do any of those preps or practice, or is it only in the classroom?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1246.012s">[Mustone]</a>: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5169.787s">[Mustone]</a>: Member Di Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5170.708s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6135.843s">[Mustone]</a>: Thanks for sharing your proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6137.164s">[Mustone]</a>: I think Member DiBenedetto and Member Ruggiero said it well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6141.666s">[Mustone]</a>: We only have three roles, really.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6143.767s">[Mustone]</a>: It's to set policy, oversee the budget, and to hire and supervise a superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6148.809s">[Mustone]</a>: I think this needs to be discussed with all of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6152.231s">[Mustone]</a>: I appreciate you trying to streamline it with three of the committee members, but we all need to be part of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6157.313s">[Mustone]</a>: I appreciated last year during the meetings hearing from each department and hearing from the departments, but also hearing while I was at my children's schools<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6165.717s">[Mustone]</a>: what the teachers and the parents were seeing, and to be able to hear it and put it together in my mind of what the needs are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6172.139s">[Mustone]</a>: So I appreciate the proposal, but I do think we should stick with how we've done it in the past, that all seven of us are part of hearing from the departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6935.407s">[Mustone]</a>: Roll call vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6944.675s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5838.412s">[Mustone]</a>: I think the lottery has been long needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5841.838s">[Mustone]</a>: The superintendent's predecessor had told me that every year it went back and forth with which school was more popular, like Member DiBenedetto said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5850.601s">[Mustone]</a>: That's not addressing the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5852.042s">[Mustone]</a>: I think Paulette said it perfectly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5853.982s">[Mustone]</a>: It might be painful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5855.223s">[Mustone]</a>: I have a fifth grader.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5856.363s">[Mustone]</a>: Maybe she'll end up at McGlen and her three siblings went to the Andrews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5859.765s">[Mustone]</a>: I want to live with that if it's at doing the right thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5862.486s">[Mustone]</a>: This is a justice issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5863.666s">[Mustone]</a>: We haven't done it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5865.847s">[Mustone]</a>: We've never<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5866.746s">[Mustone]</a>: bite the bullet before in the past, I'm appreciating the superintendent saying this is the right thing to do by our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5873.174s">[Mustone]</a>: I understand you want to make sure it's rolled out well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5875.157s">[Mustone]</a>: I have great confidence the superintendent will make sure it's rolled out well, that the parents are informed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5879.642s">[Mustone]</a>: But this is my third year on the school committee and it's been frustrating every year because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5884.761s">[Mustone]</a>: First of all, we're not a school choice program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5887.723s">[Mustone]</a>: Your predecessors say last year that we're a school choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5890.664s">[Mustone]</a>: No elementary schools you get to choose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5893.146s">[Mustone]</a>: You go by where they tell you live.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5895.527s">[Mustone]</a>: We've never followed school choice as it's really the definition of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5899.889s">[Mustone]</a>: So I understand we need to make sure it's rolled out well, but this needs to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5905.132s">[Mustone]</a>: It's been a long time, and I'm tired of the schools going back and forth depending on personnel issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5910.678s">[Mustone]</a>: If we have equal number of kids at both schools, it shouldn't matter about who the administration is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5915.721s">[Mustone]</a>: It's about the kids in the classroom who make the culture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5917.842s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6238.47s">[Mustone]</a>: Are you seconding Erin's?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6340.605s">[Mustone]</a>: Yeah, like a projection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6341.425s">[Mustone]</a>: A projection of how it would roll out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2356.043s">[Mustone]</a>: Linda, I don't mean to put you on the spot, but do you want to just say a few words so the community knows what your reading partners do with our students, please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2364.653s">[Mustone]</a>: Lender is the reading coordinator for Mystic Valley Elder Services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4704.352s">[Mustone]</a>: I have a report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4706.09s">[Mustone]</a>: Can you just explain to me how the Columbus, the McGlynn, and the Roberts all have taken the access test in 2017 and 2018, but not the Brooks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4724.079s">[Mustone]</a>: Do you know the number that you need?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4754.452s">[Mustone]</a>: It was 2018.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4755.353s">[Mustone]</a>: It was 2018.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4801.483s">[Mustone]</a>: So the Roberts has the newcomers for third, fourth, and fifth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4808.865s">[Mustone]</a>: And to place out of newcomers, they take the access test.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4815.686s">[Mustone]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4816.967s">[Mustone]</a>: So then how do the children at the Columbus and the McGlynn take the access test?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4823.128s">[Mustone]</a>: They cannot be in the newcomers class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4831.663s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay, so there's English learners in the Columbus and the McGlynn, but not newcomers programs, that are a significant amount of students that they can take the, they have the data to give you a MET target or a C target, but there's not the number at the Brooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4848.946s">[Mustone]</a>: That is English language learners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4883.175s">[Mustone]</a>: And because it's percents, I don't know the number of actual students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4886.238s">[Mustone]</a>: So do you know, do the Columbus, the McGlynn, and the Roberts have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4890.243s">[Mustone]</a>: pretty similar numbers of students who take the access test?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5051.403s">[Mustone]</a>: Can you tell us how many EL teachers you have at each of the four elementary schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5073.728s">[Mustone]</a>: going or what I'm wondering is if the Roberts, the McGlynn, and the Columbus have more teachers, more resources, do children who are in the neighborhood of Brooks not go to the Brooks because there's more EL teachers at the Roberts, the Columbus, and the McGlynn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5105.719s">[Mustone]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5106.9s">[Mustone]</a>: So do you know, though, how many EL teachers are at each elementary?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5164.877s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay, and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5518.436s">[Mustone]</a>: Mr. Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5896.184s">[Mustone]</a>: For grade 10, there's 104 males that were screened and 114 females.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5903.529s">[Mustone]</a>: And I think the grade 10 class is more around the 300 number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5907.791s">[Mustone]</a>: So was it optional if the kids were screened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5910.433s">[Mustone]</a>: Some students and some families do opt out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5913.714s">[Mustone]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5915.535s">[Mustone]</a>: So would you say you had 100 students opt out, or is it just a sampling?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5942.249s">[Mustone]</a>: But I'm just wondering, would people who are suffering with obesity opt out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5947.833s">[Mustone]</a>: Would the numbers be worse?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6735.137s">[Mustone]</a>: When you say you had to replace 10 feet of pipes, is it a plumbing subcontractor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6743.021s">[Mustone]</a>: Could you ask, so we are not playing catch up with classrooms every winter, what would the cost be to replace?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6762.354s">[Mustone]</a>: But at least we have a number to start with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6764.555s">[Mustone]</a>: Because it's every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6765.795s">[Mustone]</a>: I mean, this is only my third year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6767.176s">[Mustone]</a>: And every year, parents talk about whether their kids are freezing or too hot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6771.818s">[Mustone]</a>: So why don't we just bite the bullet somehow in planning?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6774.339s">[Mustone]</a>: At least if we have a number, we know what we're aiming for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6781.182s">[Mustone]</a>: I can't wait to hear it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2264.443s">[Mustone]</a>: Could I ask, would it have been possible, or is it too late, that could a police officer have been assigned to this,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2285.005s">[Mustone]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2287.707s">[Mustone]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2288.127s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2386.844s">[Mustone]</a>: Nitty gritty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2387.907s">[Mustone]</a>: But I think because I was surprised when I saw it on the agenda, and we haven't really had a conversation about it since maybe May.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2395.451s">[Mustone]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2395.872s">[Mustone]</a>: Yeah, May.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2397.492s">[Mustone]</a>: And it probably just fell off my radar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2399.614s">[Mustone]</a>: Could it be a possible one-year contract?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2402.395s">[Mustone]</a>: I mean, just thinking of personnel and how often we talk about the budget and the cost of personnel and the cost of every union, and just to add another person on, whereas<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2414.738s">[Mustone]</a>: I think I'd rather a position for more math coaches.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2419.285s">[Mustone]</a>: And I understand it's split between the city and the school, but could it be a one-year job to see if they're just implementing what we get from Safe Havens?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2426.777s">[Mustone]</a>: It's kind of...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2446.032s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2473.4s">[Mustone]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=5068.537s">[Mustone]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=5068.717s">[Mustone]</a>: Mustone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=5070.118s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=5071.079s">[Mustone]</a>: And you had mentioned deer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=5073.184s">[Mustone]</a>: program and when Jasper just mentioned his brother in fifth grade which that's when we have it do you know is there a new curriculum that is being worked on that's updated with these new concerns for dear you don't know I didn't know in your work if you've come across any discussion about it<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=5187.484s">[Mustone]</a>: I think Michael, did you turn off the projector?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=5189.165s">[Mustone]</a>: I don't know, do they want it on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2556.684s">[Mustone]</a>: So I will try to bring the highlights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2558.285s">[Mustone]</a>: We did have a follow-up buildings and grounds subcommittee meeting on November 29th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2562.088s">[Mustone]</a>: It was a follow-up from our meeting last May to hear about updates in security and safety at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2571.195s">[Mustone]</a>: So present were four school committee members, the superintendent,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2575.897s">[Mustone]</a>: two parents of both elementary and high school age students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2580.298s">[Mustone]</a>: We had three Medford police officers, Lieutenant Covino, Officer Ziobro, and Officer Lokowitz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2586.86s">[Mustone]</a>: The director of buildings and grounds was in attendance, director of nursing, the high school principal, and the assistant superintendent, Miss Patterson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2594.483s">[Mustone]</a>: So we had a good representation of everyone at the high school building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2600.144s">[Mustone]</a>: First item that Officer Ziobro shared with us is that he does attend<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2605.563s">[Mustone]</a>: monthly meetings with the community-based justice coalition with the assistant district attorney.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2614.185s">[Mustone]</a>: The director of nursing, Toni Wray, also attends, and it's to address high-level risk situations and highly troubled students that they are paying attention to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2627.639s">[Mustone]</a>: Second was the safe haven report at that time was not released to the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2634.184s">[Mustone]</a>: It was understood that it is a Department of Homeland Security document and it is a privileged document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2641.283s">[Mustone]</a>: Parts that can be shared will be shared when it is available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2646.108s">[Mustone]</a>: Third was all the cameras have been fixed or are currently being fixed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2651.212s">[Mustone]</a>: So all the cameras in all of the school buildings are fixed or are on a list to be fixed happening currently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2658.438s">[Mustone]</a>: Next, oh, some question was asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2660.46s">[Mustone]</a>: There are 95 cameras on the high school campus, and it is privileged information where they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2668.133s">[Mustone]</a>: The other concern parents had was the doors being marked from the outside of the school buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2674.376s">[Mustone]</a>: Currently, there are doors that were unmarked that are now being marked by Mr. McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2684.942s">[Mustone]</a>: The next highlight was that Mr. DeLava shared that on November 6, there was a training about safety care for kids in crisis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2692.305s">[Mustone]</a>: He wanted to thank the Medford Police Department for their continuing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2695.875s">[Mustone]</a>: training and building relationships with students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2700.117s">[Mustone]</a>: Mr. DeLeva also shared that dogs from area police departments and the state police came to do some training in the building, both for drugs and ballistics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2711.901s">[Mustone]</a>: We did learn that different dogs are trained for specific sins, differing between drug paraphernalia and ballistics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2723.23s">[Mustone]</a>: We did, after the safety update, we did discuss the feminine hygiene products being installed in the high school, and that will be in a follow-up report with Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2732.28s">[Mustone]</a>: Diane Caldwell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2734.022s">[Mustone]</a>: I don't know if my fellow members, Erin and, I mean, Committee Member DiVenedetto and Committee Member Kreatz are both on the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2741.887s">[Mustone]</a>: buildings and grout subcommittee and committee member Van der Kloot was in attendance and that is all I have to share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3017.779s">[Mustone]</a>: I don't know the answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3019.78s">[Mustone]</a>: The only thing I could think of is maybe it's possible that because of toxic shock syndrome, that it's not something that the school feels comfortable, because then you'd be liable, God forbid,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3029.48s">[Mustone]</a>: someone came with toxic shock syndrome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3169.207s">[Mustone]</a>: Jonathan just shared that the current dispensers have dual capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3173.849s">[Mustone]</a>: So if the time comes that you need to dispense dual products, you can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6706.182s">[Mustone]</a>: I'll get it later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6709.743s">[Mustone]</a>: Just to make sure, we will have these books for September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6719.979s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6720.26s">[Mustone]</a>: Great, so full rollout September 2019.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6723.481s">[Mustone]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6724.721s">[Mustone]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6724.962s">[Mustone]</a>: Patterson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6747.617s">[Mustone]</a>: Just rereading my notes, I made an oversight at our Buildings and Grounds Subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6751.979s">[Mustone]</a>: Officer Bill Mazzacca was present, and I do feel remiss if I don't say that I appreciate his input at that meeting as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6916.046s">[Mustone]</a>: Any of the 14 school districts that were funded?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6918.967s">[Mustone]</a>: The 12 will be listed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6921.187s">[Mustone]</a>: They will?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6921.607s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6922.187s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3138.038s">[Mustone]</a>: My mama will owe $20,000 in two years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3142.319s">[Mustone]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3142.519s">[Mustone]</a>: Frello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3142.959s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3143.619s">[Mustone]</a>: So will middle schoolers be, so right in two years I'll have a sophomore, freshman, and seventh grader.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3148.98s">[Mustone]</a>: Will middle schoolers be open to the triple?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3151.301s">[Mustone]</a>: Will you keep it to strictly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3179.015s">[Mustone]</a>: And then just in regards to looking two years out, so will you somehow try to reach out to current<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3187.322s">[Mustone]</a>: 5th and 6th graders?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6330.489s">[Mustone]</a>: I appreciate you wanting parents to get here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6332.69s">[Mustone]</a>: I'd love to see parents here often, but like most of us, we do also have kids with bedtimes and feeding dinner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6341.466s">[Mustone]</a>: We have eight subcommittees that I think if a parent has a real concern about an issue, we've all been emailed on that issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6349.993s">[Mustone]</a>: And most of the time, if it's an issue that a number of parents are concerned with, it does get addressed at a subcommittee, whether it's buildings and grounds, community relations, curriculum, special ed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6359.862s">[Mustone]</a>: So if we only book this twice a year, the concern that might bring a parent out might not even be on the agenda for those two meetings a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6368.189s">[Mustone]</a>: So I'm not sure if this would really<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6370.508s">[Mustone]</a>: get parents here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6371.729s">[Mustone]</a>: I think a meeting open to parents, like the community relations where parents have an actual concern about relations, they can come to the subcommittee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6382.035s">[Mustone]</a>: Or if it's a concern about class size, we can bring it to curriculum and talk to the parents who are very concerned and make a time for them that works for them to get there, whether it's at 4 o'clock on a Wednesday or, you know, 7 o'clock on a Thursday night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6397.245s">[Mustone]</a>: I just, having two meetings a year,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6400.66s">[Mustone]</a>: That doesn't mean their issue is going to fall on the agenda for those two meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6411.888s">[Mustone]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6455.622s">[Mustone]</a>: whether it's going to the high school for TLC with Mr. DeLava or doing a walk audit on Salem Street for parents at the Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6461.865s">[Mustone]</a>: I know everyone here has done projects specific to parents who've reached out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6466.527s">[Mustone]</a>: So I haven't heard from parents saying that they haven't been heard or there's an issue that they would have come if it wasn't on a Monday night at 7.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6474.31s">[Mustone]</a>: Maybe it's different parent group than I'm speaking with than you are speaking with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6479.192s">[Mustone]</a>: But I haven't yet heard a parent say, Mia,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6481.708s">[Mustone]</a>: We need a meeting on a Saturday because the school committee is not hearing us or not addressing something that we've brought to your attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6519.705s">[Mustone]</a>: Yeah, I think we'll agree to disagree, at least on my side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=530.799s">[Mustone]</a>: Mr. Russo, present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=3395.813s">[Mustone]</a>: Not a question, but just it goes with your college fair night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=3399.855s">[Mustone]</a>: Tomorrow night at the Danvers Port Yacht Club, there's over 20 military colleges and universities who have their own college fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=3407.278s">[Mustone]</a>: Oh, wow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=3407.858s">[Mustone]</a>: Someone had asked me to share that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=3409.799s">[Mustone]</a>: So tomorrow is Wednesday, November 7, 7 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=3414.521s">[Mustone]</a>: at Danvers Port Yacht Club, over 20 military colleges and universities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=3420.123s">[Mustone]</a>: So that's FYI.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=3421.724s">[Mustone]</a>: Wednesday or Tuesday?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=3422.704s">[Mustone]</a>: Wednesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=3423.204s">[Mustone]</a>: Wednesday the 7th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=3425.285s">[Mustone]</a>: November 7th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=3427.625s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=3428.266s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=3565.152s">[Mustone]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=104.639s">[Mustone]</a>: I'd like to call the Medford School Committee meeting to order for October 15, 2018.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=109.18s">[Mustone]</a>: Could we all stand for the Pledge of Allegiance, please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=116.141s">[Mustone]</a>: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=129.384s">[Mustone]</a>: So first on the agenda is approval of minutes from our October 1, 2018 meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=134.14s">[Mustone]</a>: Roll call vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=155.091s">[Mustone]</a>: May I, motion to approve the minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=159.953s">[Mustone]</a>: All those in favor, approving the minutes from October 1st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=262.733s">[Mustone]</a>: There is a committee of the whole report on the overview of MCAS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=266.676s">[Mustone]</a>: It is lengthy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=270.799s">[Mustone]</a>: I don't know if Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=271.48s">[Mustone]</a>: Caldwell would like to sum up the meeting or I'm not sure who authored these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=278.578s">[Mustone]</a>: You didn't offer them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=279.579s">[Mustone]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=280.98s">[Mustone]</a>: I can speak to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=422.186s">[Mustone]</a>: Do any of those members have anything to say about our MCAS Committee of the Whole?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=426.308s">[Mustone]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=431.03s">[Mustone]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=431.41s">[Mustone]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=432.49s">[Mustone]</a>: The motion carried to accept the Committee of the Whole report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=435.632s">[Mustone]</a>: Next is the Building and Grounds Subcommittee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=438.273s">[Mustone]</a>: So today at 4 o'clock we have a Building and Grounds Committee regarding the playground at the Roberts, the surface of the playground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=446.1s">[Mustone]</a>: Aaron DiVenedetto, Kathy Kreatz, and myself are on the building and grounds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=449.981s">[Mustone]</a>: I am the chair, so I'm not speaking as the chair tonight of the school committee, but right now as the chair of the buildings and grounds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=456.424s">[Mustone]</a>: Unfortunately, we were notified last week that the interlocking bricks that we were using for the playground surface are no longer being produced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=466.167s">[Mustone]</a>: The man who was the rep from the playground company came to our meeting today, and he explained that a surface in another part of the country<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=475.911s">[Mustone]</a>: had the bricks in for only a year and a half and they were cracks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=479.192s">[Mustone]</a>: So it had to do with the UA, some fancy chemical word, UV, and that they halted production.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=488.114s">[Mustone]</a>: So Christine, please feel free to stay up because I'm sure I'll forget some of the other words.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=492.636s">[Mustone]</a>: And that he came to give us other options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=494.796s">[Mustone]</a>: So when the original options were presented,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=498.018s">[Mustone]</a>: when Cheryl Rodriguez did the research, it was these interlocking breaks, a poor in place surface, or a rubber bond surface.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=507.765s">[Mustone]</a>: So from the meeting, we heard from Travis, the playground rep, and from other peoples in the community, a woman who's a member, Roberta Cameron, from the Community Preservation Committee was there to make sure that the grant and its language would be able to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=524.474s">[Mustone]</a>: still, the grant money could still be used for a rubber bond surface.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=529.618s">[Mustone]</a>: Kathy, Erin, and I voted to move forward because the CPC will still fund it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=537.004s">[Mustone]</a>: The one issue that we have to address this week that our assistant superintendent, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=542.368s">[Mustone]</a>: Patterson, is addressing is the state bid list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=545.35s">[Mustone]</a>: So this is what I don't understand at all that much if you want to add on from here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=549.754s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=745.556s">[Mustone]</a>: We can vote again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=746.477s">[Mustone]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=747.077s">[Mustone]</a>: We'd love to vote here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=747.878s">[Mustone]</a>: And then I'll record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=749.299s">[Mustone]</a>: So what's the motion, Paula?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=750.3s">[Mustone]</a>: Do you want us to give the motion that we gave today?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=752.221s">[Mustone]</a>: Yeah, what was the motion that you gave?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=883.916s">[Mustone]</a>: So the motion was by Erin, seconded by Kathy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=886.176s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=897.42s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=905.435s">[Mustone]</a>: absent, a motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=908.057s">[Mustone]</a>: Patterson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=909.218s">[Mustone]</a>: Next on the agenda is community participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=911.679s">[Mustone]</a>: I do see some parents here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=913.841s">[Mustone]</a>: I don't know if there's any new issue the parents want to talk about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=917.003s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=917.463s">[Mustone]</a>: Come on up, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=933.826s">[Mustone]</a>: Will you please say your name and address for the record?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1441.04s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1666.467s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1669.87s">[Mustone]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1670.31s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1671.451s">[Mustone]</a>: Next on the agenda is our report of superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1675.154s">[Mustone]</a>: Dr. Maurice?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2286.248s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2286.708s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2288.26s">[Mustone]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2289.441s">[Mustone]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2291.082s">[Mustone]</a>: Second by Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2292.664s">[Mustone]</a>: Kreatz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2294.145s">[Mustone]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2294.925s">[Mustone]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2295.386s">[Mustone]</a>: Motion carried.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2296.246s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2296.787s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you, Doctor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2298.108s">[Mustone]</a>: Next is the recommendation to approve the Puerto Rico field trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2301.33s">[Mustone]</a>: I'm not sure who's asking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2559.958s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2560.698s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2602.641s">[Mustone]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2681.466s">[Mustone]</a>: School committee member Kreatz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2717.421s">[Mustone]</a>: Oh, my god.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2718.421s">[Mustone]</a>: School committee member Ruggiero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2737.996s">[Mustone]</a>: That was my question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2738.697s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2739.137s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2740.058s">[Mustone]</a>: It sounds great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2740.498s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2740.698s">[Mustone]</a>: Have a blast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2741.779s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2742.399s">[Mustone]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2743.34s">[Mustone]</a>: Motion to approve by Irene B. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2745.261s">[Mustone]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2745.801s">[Mustone]</a>: Second by Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2746.762s">[Mustone]</a>: Lucretia Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2747.642s">[Mustone]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2748.703s">[Mustone]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2748.903s">[Mustone]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2749.664s">[Mustone]</a>: Probably a roll call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2750.724s">[Mustone]</a>: Is there a roll call?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2752.325s">[Mustone]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2752.886s">[Mustone]</a>: Probably a roll call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2753.626s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2762.972s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2768.207s">[Mustone]</a>: Six yes, one absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2770.208s">[Mustone]</a>: Motion carries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2772.588s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2774.028s">[Mustone]</a>: Gracias.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2775.329s">[Mustone]</a>: Gracias.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3472.449s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3473.81s">[Mustone]</a>: I did see two of my girls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3475.651s">[Mustone]</a>: I saw their Darth Vader and Penguin socks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3648.019s">[Mustone]</a>: Sounds good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3648.439s">[Mustone]</a>: School committee member Ruggiero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3983.039s">[Mustone]</a>: Are you looking where it's Robert's?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4076.21s">[Mustone]</a>: While you're here and while we're all in the same room, I do want to bring up our city engineer, Todd Ellery, who's a very active parent at the Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4083.014s">[Mustone]</a>: Sarah as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4084.435s">[Mustone]</a>: Just because I know for one of the goals for the Roberts, it says to apply for the infrastructure assessment grant from the DOT when the application comes out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4093.841s">[Mustone]</a>: And I don't know if I know that Sarah Ellery, myself, had walked around with Sergeant Harnett around the Roberts to look at all the ways that it could be improved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4102.226s">[Mustone]</a>: And then the second time we went out with the city engineer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4104.407s">[Mustone]</a>: The first time was just the policeman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4106.13s">[Mustone]</a>: So can you guys come up just so you can talk a little bit about, I think part of the reason not many kids walk to the Roberts is because of the fouls way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4118.635s">[Mustone]</a>: Well, you've been working on it for a long time, Mallory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4121.736s">[Mustone]</a>: Todd's just got here last year, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4123.216s">[Mustone]</a>: Do you want to go first?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4391.425s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4597.335s">[Mustone]</a>: I would like a motion to approve the mass use of safe routes to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4604.118s">[Mustone]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4606.059s">[Mustone]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5855.48s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5857.741s">[Mustone]</a>: Thanks for coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5859.022s">[Mustone]</a>: To help you recruit, what is the hourly rate for the different positions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7919.35s">[Mustone]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7919.67s">[Mustone]</a>: So last year we piloted McGraw-Hill and FOSS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7923.432s">[Mustone]</a>: I heard back that all the teachers thought McGraw-Hill was not a good program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7928.214s">[Mustone]</a>: That left us with only FOSS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7930.115s">[Mustone]</a>: So I'm not sure why we still are discussing, if we are doing it, shouldn't we just make a motion to buy it<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7937.585s">[Mustone]</a>: and get the training on the calendar for teachers so they're ready in September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7941.15s">[Mustone]</a>: I mean, we've been having a science conversation for two and a half years now, for the two and a half years I've been on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7946.777s">[Mustone]</a>: So to delay it again, I'm losing my patience with science.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7951.322s">[Mustone]</a>: And the MCAS test will show it tomorrow night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7982.219s">[Mustone]</a>: I mean I was shocked to go to my parent-teacher meeting and to hear that my fourth grader was doing McGraw-Hill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7988.005s">[Mustone]</a>: Because I thought last year we decided everyone was going to do Foss because everyone had said McGraw-Hill was terrible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7993.892s">[Mustone]</a>: So I'm sorry if I seem impatient.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7998.598s">[Mustone]</a>: But it seems like Floss was the one that all the teachers said was worth investing in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8800.026s">[Mustone]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8800.187s">[Mustone]</a>: Mustone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8801.547s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8802.348s">[Mustone]</a>: Colwell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8802.868s">[Mustone]</a>: I'm trying to look at the enrollment chart for the elementary and the day of attendance for the elementary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8812.514s">[Mustone]</a>: So the day of attendance was 9-6.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8813.855s">[Mustone]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8815.596s">[Mustone]</a>: Are you looking at the... So it just has one top says elementary attendance, 9-6-18, and one has<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8825.5s">[Mustone]</a>: elementary enrollment, 9, 26, 18.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8828.743s">[Mustone]</a>: So enrollment is the ones that are registered in Parent Information Center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8833.546s">[Mustone]</a>: The attendance is just from School Brains that day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8840.632s">[Mustone]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8841.032s">[Mustone]</a>: So the only thing that struck me was for the day of attendance, the Brooks had three absent out of 544.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8849.639s">[Mustone]</a>: The Columbus had 11 absent out of 406.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8855.025s">[Mustone]</a>: The McGlynn had 20 absent out of 478, and the Roberts had 9 absent out of 563.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8861.188s">[Mustone]</a>: I didn't do the percentage yet, but just after hearing that report about chronic absenteeism, the 20 at the McGlynn did strike me to have 20 absent in one day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8872.032s">[Mustone]</a>: So is that something that is noted on school brains when a school has a higher percentage of absenteeism one day as opposed to another?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8901.445s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=49.369s">[Mustone]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2860.788s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2862.929s">[Mustone]</a>: By the list of the documents you're going to review, you have your work cut out for you, and I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2868.273s">[Mustone]</a>: But I did want to just add one thing that had been an ongoing conversation for the last two years was the maintenance and upkeep and renovation of many of our school buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2877.88s">[Mustone]</a>: So I don't know if maybe on that list you could just have Mr. McLaughlin give you an update of what really needs to be done, like Member van der Kloot said about the compresses, 15,000 for our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2891.298s">[Mustone]</a>: 30, I think, was it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2892.658s">[Mustone]</a>: How many in total?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2893.779s">[Mustone]</a>: Right, 15,000, but we need 30 of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2896.359s">[Mustone]</a>: How many?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2898.84s">[Mustone]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2899.24s">[Mustone]</a>: So that's just the only other thing that I know that we've had conversations about many times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=4860.76s">[Mustone]</a>: It has not been read yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=542.877s">[Mustone]</a>: Can I make a motion for the suspension of the rules today?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=546.399s">[Mustone]</a>: It's out of order for item 11, negotiations, item 1, the report of opening of schools, and item 6, the report on buildings and grounds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4881.257s">[Mustone]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4883.543s">[Mustone]</a>: unclear of the two different processes that are happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4888.286s">[Mustone]</a>: Cheryl, do you mind coming up again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4890.407s">[Mustone]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4891.948s">[Mustone]</a>: I think there was just so much information that was just given.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4898.391s">[Mustone]</a>: I feel like I just learned how to be a procurement officer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4905.228s">[Mustone]</a>: you had said you had a solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4907.13s">[Mustone]</a>: So can you walk it through?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4908.932s">[Mustone]</a>: The landscaping is one thing with removal and disposal and the purchase of the playground blocks, interlocking blocks is a different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4921.408s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes, that was always the plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4923.53s">[Mustone]</a>: So what would you, I'm saying if you, if you say this is right, what would you have us like, how would it start?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4955.932s">[Mustone]</a>: So the RFP, there still needs to be an RFP because it's over $50,000 in product.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4961.516s">[Mustone]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4967.64s">[Mustone]</a>: We don't need an RFP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4969.221s">[Mustone]</a>: And that person is a state contract?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4971.382s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4972.223s">[Mustone]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4972.623s">[Mustone]</a>: And then what happens?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4994.812s">[Mustone]</a>: So is the groundmaster still an option?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5026.137s">[Mustone]</a>: So what the two estimates that came in at 223 and 224?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5031.13s">[Mustone]</a>: That was not including what Groundmasters was already doing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5034.091s">[Mustone]</a>: No, that was the whole thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5039.313s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay, so that was never part of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5041.194s">[Mustone]</a>: So Groundmasters was always on board, that was always the plan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5086.303s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay, so that seems absurd, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5101.873s">[Mustone]</a>: So if the $90,000 for this company, Rubble, what was it called?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5107.317s">[Mustone]</a>: That does not include some underlying, but ground masters can't do that either?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5117.985s">[Mustone]</a>: So I know ground masters is removal and disposal and we have the product, but then there's some intermediate sod you need or something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5128.357s">[Mustone]</a>: So can either ground masters do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7094.774s">[Mustone]</a>: Tomorrow night is the football opening game against Lynn Classical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7100.419s">[Mustone]</a>: The marching band will be performing halftime.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7102.642s">[Mustone]</a>: The greatest showman, the movie, the greatest showman is the music.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7107.014s">[Mustone]</a>: So if everyone wants to come out and support Medford football.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7110.015s">[Mustone]</a>: It's at seven o'clock, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7111.396s">[Mustone]</a>: They switched, this year the football games start at six.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7114.097s">[Mustone]</a>: Six.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7114.757s">[Mustone]</a>: They used to be seven, now they're six.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7423.818s">[Mustone]</a>: For the Andrews, Teagan and Colin brought home<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7428.193s">[Mustone]</a>: piece of paper this size already filled out with my information and Tim's information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7432.154s">[Mustone]</a>: And it's just that if there are changes, change it and sign it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7436.315s">[Mustone]</a>: Nevin, Rowan, and Declan, you're right, I had to fill out the same paper three times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7443.056s">[Mustone]</a>: I don't know how the Andrews, if the Andrews School is just more familiar with the School Brains software that they just printed out and sent it home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7452.51s">[Mustone]</a>: I don't know if Mr. DeLeva remembers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7457.195s">[Mustone]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7457.736s">[Mustone]</a>: Well, do the high school kids get a piece of paper already with the information on it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7488.338s">[Mustone]</a>: So the high school, do you print it out and send it home?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7505.225s">[Mustone]</a>: Not at the Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7506.066s">[Mustone]</a>: I don't know about the Columbus, or the McGlynn, or the Brooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7509.247s">[Mustone]</a>: Did you have to fill out paper?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7510.608s">[Mustone]</a>: At the Columbus, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7524.475s">[Mustone]</a>: But if it is a school brain's capability, it was nice to have Tegan and Cullen just say, mom, just check this, and me say it's all the same and pass it back in, then filling out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7537.502s">[Mustone]</a>: To see how Mr. Downs did it, or Mr. DeLeva did it before he left.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9049.473s">[Mustone]</a>: But thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9050.794s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9052.535s">[Mustone]</a>: I just want to inform the Roberts parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9055.337s">[Mustone]</a>: So the number one bus at the Roberts is overcrowded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9058.758s">[Mustone]</a>: Unfortunately with the kindergarten added on today, there was a very overloaded bus that three of my own children ward, but Christine is working with Tatiana from the bus company and Mr. O'Brien, the Roberts vice principals working as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9071.902s">[Mustone]</a>: So that will be addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9072.903s">[Mustone]</a>: So for parents who are concerned, it is being worked on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9075.944s">[Mustone]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9076.344s">[Mustone]</a>: And by next Monday, it should be evened out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9078.486s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9178.794s">[Mustone]</a>: Can you just talk about safety?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9181.256s">[Mustone]</a>: I noticed that recently a crossing was hit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9185.491s">[Mustone]</a>: and it was school dismissal time, and I do think that I... Not at Medford, sorry, not at Medford, another city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9194.513s">[Mustone]</a>: But even up with us on Highland Ave, and on our intersection of Highland Ave and Sturges, a number of times the bus will be stopped, he'll have the stop sign, and cars will pass while kids are getting out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9246.713s">[Mustone]</a>: But I know in the past that this has come up, not at your intersection, and that the DPW has gone and removed mounds of snow from a bus stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9254.36s">[Mustone]</a>: So if you give us the heads up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9291.366s">[Mustone]</a>: And even in the past, parents have had,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9294.703s">[Mustone]</a>: parents who have had concern, the police has sent someone for a few days, because a lot of times it's a regular commuter that is passing the bus, and the police presence has slowed people down to respect the bus rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9309.573s">[Mustone]</a>: So maybe that's another, maybe the police department could look at Hadley Place in Salem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10002.409s">[Mustone]</a>: I just want to suggest that maybe we could even think about budgeting buying the supplies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10006.631s">[Mustone]</a>: So a friend of mine works in Portsmouth, New Hampshire,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10009.68s">[Mustone]</a>: the school department buys the supply.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10012.342s">[Mustone]</a>: She did look it up while she was over at my house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10014.224s">[Mustone]</a>: It's 40,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10015.365s">[Mustone]</a>: They have a much smaller school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10017.846s">[Mustone]</a>: But if we were to average $50 a student, it'd be $200,000 more or less.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10024.612s">[Mustone]</a>: So, I mean, that is another goal that we could have because it is, I mean, I spent over $200 for the kids going to Staples.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10034.079s">[Mustone]</a>: So, I mean, if we want to go beyond just trying to get a break on it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10039.123s">[Mustone]</a>: Why don't we put it into our school budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10043.525s">[Mustone]</a>: I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10043.866s">[Mustone]</a>: Potentially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10044.546s">[Mustone]</a>: Somewhere else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=477.835s">[Mustone]</a>: So the parents were reimbursed for the lost iPhone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4368.597s">[Mustone]</a>: You had just read the six languages, Italian, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Chinese, Arabic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4374.122s">[Mustone]</a>: Are there any other language that is taught at the high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4395.757s">[Mustone]</a>: You don't teach Latin at high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4398.799s">[Mustone]</a>: So what are the three languages, again, that are taught at the high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4401.535s">[Mustone]</a>: Spanish, Italian, and French.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4403.396s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4775.674s">[Mustone]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4776.974s">[Mustone]</a>: For the 36 students who took AP,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4781.338s">[Mustone]</a>: 12, 12, and 12, so Spanish.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6503.761s">[Mustone]</a>: The scenario where someone would start at the Brooks, then go to the Roberts, and then go to the neighborhood school, do we actually do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6509.344s">[Mustone]</a>: Because I've been at the Roberts, and it was my understanding that if the child started at the Roberts in third and newcomers, they did stay through for fourth and fifth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6519.529s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6520.009s">[Mustone]</a>: That I did not know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6521.23s">[Mustone]</a>: So how many would you say students a year leave the Brooks or the Roberts to go back to their neighborhood school from the newcomers program?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6603.95s">[Mustone]</a>: that I know were in other school districts' neighborhoods, they've all stayed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6607.872s">[Mustone]</a>: And granted, that's maybe going back a few years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6610.354s">[Mustone]</a>: I'm thinking of certain friends of some of my children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6613.396s">[Mustone]</a>: So I don't know if it was a parent's request to stay at the Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6616.297s">[Mustone]</a>: I don't know if there's a back story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6618.019s">[Mustone]</a>: Do you know, Mr. Bosco?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6770.24s">[Mustone]</a>: Because I think this is a conversation that we're having a lot with parents at different schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6776.024s">[Mustone]</a>: So there are currently five teachers at the McGlynn Middle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6780.267s">[Mustone]</a>: Two for newcomers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6781.447s">[Mustone]</a>: Four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6783.329s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay, so two for newcomers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6813.739s">[Mustone]</a>: Is it possible that two teachers would stay at the book lab?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6816.961s">[Mustone]</a>: One would have newcomers grades six, seven, and eight, and one would have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6878.41s">[Mustone]</a>: So if we just, so I can have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6882.012s">[Mustone]</a>: answers to parents' questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6883.513s">[Mustone]</a>: If we duplicated the same exact middle school model at the Andrews, you would need four, you'd have to keep four at the McGlenn, and you'd need four at the Andrews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6908.558s">[Mustone]</a>: but then we would run into moving the kids from the Andrews back to the McLintock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6912.339s">[Mustone]</a>: So how many teachers would you need if you needed newcomers at both?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6916.66s">[Mustone]</a>: Would it then be seven?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6918.92s">[Mustone]</a>: Eight, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9845.517s">[Mustone]</a>: Just so we all know how you did it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9853.061s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay, so you would do a percent of the number of fifth graders in each of the four elementary schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11180.433s">[Mustone]</a>: However, I'm sorry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11188.055s">[Mustone]</a>: Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11837.623s">[Mustone]</a>: I hear you, but I think we get emails often from parents that you've referenced tonight, the after school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11844.128s">[Mustone]</a>: So I almost feel like Paul's taking the weight off my own shoulders by saying it's not something we want to do, because I do get texts regularly from friends who are also parents in the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11856.937s">[Mustone]</a>: And I think we've gotten a number of emails that all of us have shared here that if parents have a concern or a resident, we can bring it and say, we got this email from this person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11865.984s">[Mustone]</a>: So I second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11867.499s">[Mustone]</a>: Paul's motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11871.142s">[Mustone]</a>: Oh, sorry, Paulette.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11872.843s">[Mustone]</a>: Oh, she thirds it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11960.516s">[Mustone]</a>: I mean, they can email us the next day and we can bring it up at our next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11967.878s">[Mustone]</a>: It's not honest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11968.699s">[Mustone]</a>: It doesn't feel honest to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11970.139s">[Mustone]</a>: And I am totally guilty of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11972.52s">[Mustone]</a>: For the past two years, people have texted me and I've brought up issues that people have texted me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11976.622s">[Mustone]</a>: And it felt yucky.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11978.102s">[Mustone]</a>: And I never even thought of going this route with Paul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11980.764s">[Mustone]</a>: I respect him for addressing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4368.57s">[Mustone]</a>: You had just read the six languages, Italian, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Chinese, Arabic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4374.092s">[Mustone]</a>: Are there any other language that is taught at the high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4395.717s">[Mustone]</a>: You don't teach Latin at the high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4397.418s">[Mustone]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4398.779s">[Mustone]</a>: So what are the three languages, again, that I taught at high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4401.521s">[Mustone]</a>: Spanish, Italian, and French.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4403.362s">[Mustone]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4403.822s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4404.763s">[Mustone]</a>: Welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4773.917s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4774.717s">[Mustone]</a>: That was my question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4776.197s">[Mustone]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4776.957s">[Mustone]</a>: Costone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4777.618s">[Mustone]</a>: For the 36 students who took AP,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4781.318s">[Mustone]</a>: 12, 12 and 12, so Spanish.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6503.745s">[Mustone]</a>: The scenario where someone would start at the Brooks, then go to the Roberts, and then go to their neighborhood school, do we actually do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6509.349s">[Mustone]</a>: Because I've been at the Roberts, and it was my understanding that if the child started at the Roberts, and third, and newcomers, they did stay through for fourth and fifth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6519.496s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6519.996s">[Mustone]</a>: That I did not know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6521.217s">[Mustone]</a>: So how many, would you say, students a year leave the Brooks or the Roberts to go back to their neighborhood school from the newcomers program?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6603.933s">[Mustone]</a>: that I know were in other school districts' neighborhoods, they've all stayed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6607.836s">[Mustone]</a>: And granted, that's maybe going back a few years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6610.337s">[Mustone]</a>: I'm thinking of certain friends of some of my children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6613.379s">[Mustone]</a>: So I don't know if it was a parent's request to stay at the Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6616.281s">[Mustone]</a>: I don't know if there's a back story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6617.982s">[Mustone]</a>: Do you know, Mr. Bousman?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6770.247s">[Mustone]</a>: Because I think this is a conversation that we're having a lot with parents at different schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6775.989s">[Mustone]</a>: So there are currently five teachers at the McGlynn Middle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6780.231s">[Mustone]</a>: Two for newcomers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6781.431s">[Mustone]</a>: Four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6783.312s">[Mustone]</a>: OK, so two for newcomers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6813.702s">[Mustone]</a>: Is it possible that two teachers would stay at the book lab?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6816.944s">[Mustone]</a>: One would have newcomers grade 6, 7, and 8, and one would have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6878.393s">[Mustone]</a>: So if we just, so I can have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6881.995s">[Mustone]</a>: answers to parents' questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6883.476s">[Mustone]</a>: If we duplicated the same exact middle school model at the Andrews, you would need four, you'd have to keep four at the McGlenn and you'd need four at the Andrews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6908.544s">[Mustone]</a>: but then we would run into moving the kids from the Andrews back to McClint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6911.306s">[Mustone]</a>: So how many teachers would you need if you needed newcomers at both?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6916.651s">[Mustone]</a>: Would it then be seven?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6918.913s">[Mustone]</a>: Eight, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9853.023s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay, so you would do a percent of the number of fifth graders in each of the four elementary schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11197.868s">[Mustone]</a>: No one came forward by Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11209.391s">[Mustone]</a>: On the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11837.606s">[Mustone]</a>: I hear you, but I think we get emails often from parents that you've referenced tonight, the after school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11844.11s">[Mustone]</a>: So I almost feel like Paul's taking the weight off my own shoulders by saying it's not something we want to do because I do get texts regularly from friends who are also parents in the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11856.918s">[Mustone]</a>: And I think we've gotten a number of emails that all of us have shared here that if parents have a concern or a resident, we can bring it and say, we got this email from this person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11865.964s">[Mustone]</a>: So I second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11867.485s">[Mustone]</a>: Paul's motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11871.108s">[Mustone]</a>: Oh, sorry, Paulette.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11871.868s">[Mustone]</a>: I third Paul's motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11872.809s">[Mustone]</a>: Oh, she thirds it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11960.496s">[Mustone]</a>: I mean, they can email us the next day, and we can bring it up at our next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11967.859s">[Mustone]</a>: It's not honest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11968.68s">[Mustone]</a>: It doesn't feel honest to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11970.121s">[Mustone]</a>: And I am totally guilty of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11972.502s">[Mustone]</a>: For the past two years, people have texted me, and I've brought up issues that people have texted me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11976.604s">[Mustone]</a>: And it felt yucky.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11978.085s">[Mustone]</a>: And I never even thought of going this route with Paul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11980.746s">[Mustone]</a>: I respect him for addressing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6311.842s">[Mustone]</a>: I don't know about everyone, but likewise, I thought someone who was in administration was going to step in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6317.439s">[Mustone]</a>: not realizing that's not in their contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6319.92s">[Mustone]</a>: So when we did receive multiple angry emails that night and the next morning, I did respond saying, I went in assuming, shame on me, that someone in administration would step into that role per contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6332.726s">[Mustone]</a>: The other option was that the Massachusetts Association School Committees can take someone almost like an emergency superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6339.99s">[Mustone]</a>: So to me, having a middle man or middle woman come in for eight weeks, try to transition,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6345.968s">[Mustone]</a>: while we have, I almost feel like Dr. Maurice is like the Phoenix out of the ashes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6350.451s">[Mustone]</a>: Like this is going to be a whole new public school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6354.873s">[Mustone]</a>: And I did not think that was the best choice to have a middle person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6359.116s">[Mustone]</a>: Um, but I think Mr. Bellson is, has the knowledge and the history to give our new superintendent and just looking forward that we needed that transition to be smoothly done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6371.363s">[Mustone]</a>: And,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6372.938s">[Mustone]</a>: I know people don't agree with that, but I think it would have been more detrimental to our school system to bring someone in for eight weeks, and I stand by that decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8300.12s">[Mustone]</a>: I just want to say, a parent did email the next day and say, you definitely need to put in the new deputy superintendent's contract that they will step in so that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8311.467s">[Mustone]</a>: We have to add that because that isn't currently in the contract, so that doesn't work, which I was, it's a shame on me that I didn't read their contract to know that they did not have to be asked or forced into taking that superintendent's job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8328.62s">[Mustone]</a>: So that's, we can add that to make sure the next deputy superintendent is their job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9254.5s">[Mustone]</a>: Mr. Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9750.382s">[Mustone]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9750.582s">[Mustone]</a>: Mustone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9751.823s">[Mustone]</a>: Back in January, when our meeting was in the media studio,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9756.619s">[Mustone]</a>: And the McGlynn teachers spoke about their improvement plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9761.862s">[Mustone]</a>: Someone mentioned almost, I don't want to call it gifted and talented because that's not what they called it, but it was, does this sound familiar to you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9771.287s">[Mustone]</a>: And they were saying that could be a way to attract that if you spoke to the four elementary school principals and said maybe you could, kids who want to be pushed more, or kids whose parents want to push them more, maybe<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9784.017s">[Mustone]</a>: it was talked about having a program at the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9786.718s">[Mustone]</a>: Does that sound familiar to anyone else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9791.421s">[Mustone]</a>: No, this wasn't a club.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9792.461s">[Mustone]</a>: This was a curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9796.383s">[Mustone]</a>: They would be tracked, more or less.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10052.265s">[Mustone]</a>: More suggestion or just to think about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10055.487s">[Mustone]</a>: So if we did move half the ELL students to the Andrews, the numbers would be equal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10110.027s">[Mustone]</a>: So with the Roberts, we had the program grades one through five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10113.889s">[Mustone]</a>: You had the newcomers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10114.83s">[Mustone]</a>: And for a few years, we were maxed on physical space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10118.912s">[Mustone]</a>: So this year, grades one and two went to the Brooks, Roberts retained three, four, and five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10123.935s">[Mustone]</a>: And I haven't heard much feedback one way or the other, but it freed up physical space in our building at the Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10134.783s">[Mustone]</a>: just thinking of the 50 families, well, or 29, who end up not getting what they desired in our school choice, and if you, the Andrews used to have an ELL program, and we had the staffing for it, maybe that's a way to, and Justin, I guess Justin is what made me think of it, is that you don't want the McGlynn to be almost stigmatized, and if the Andrews has it as well, then we're helping there too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10169.455s">[Mustone]</a>: Oh, good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10190.62s">[Mustone]</a>: I know, but we're going to get our hands dirty one way or the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10193.242s">[Mustone]</a>: Either we're going to have 29 really angry families, or we're going to be dirty our hands with staffing with ELL.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10284.394s">[Mustone]</a>: Oh, I understand if we have to hire four additional teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10592.36s">[Mustone]</a>: suggested that Mr. Tucci is debating on whether he would like to stay as principal?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10606.711s">[Mustone]</a>: But it's not like you said, by Friday, so we can tell the public that the McGlynn will have a principal in September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10611.494s">[Mustone]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10630.53s">[Mustone]</a>: I think that would be helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11540.957s">[Mustone]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11541.157s">[Mustone]</a>: Mustone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11543.378s">[Mustone]</a>: Division three tennis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11545.279s">[Mustone]</a>: Any other sports?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=13076.704s">[Mustone]</a>: Yeah, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=13077.685s">[Mustone]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=13588.855s">[Mustone]</a>: Millstone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=13591.617s">[Mustone]</a>: I think I've never even heard of an adaptive physical education teacher, so that seems very exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=13597.702s">[Mustone]</a>: Is the plan that they would co-teach with Mr. McGlenn at the Roberts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=13603.942s">[Mustone]</a>: or would they go in and tell Mr. McGlynn or share ideas with Mr. McGlynn and travel the schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6311.808s">[Mustone]</a>: I don't know about everyone, but likewise, I thought someone who was in administration was going to step in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6317.405s">[Mustone]</a>: not realizing that's not in their contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6319.886s">[Mustone]</a>: So when we did receive multiple angry emails that night and the next morning, I did respond saying, I went in assuming, shame on me, that someone in administration would step into that role per contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6332.692s">[Mustone]</a>: The other option was that the Massachusetts Association School Committees can take someone almost like an emergency superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6339.956s">[Mustone]</a>: So to me, having a middle man or middle woman come in for eight weeks, try to transition,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6345.935s">[Mustone]</a>: while we have, I almost feel like Dr. Maurice is like the Phoenix out of the ashes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6350.418s">[Mustone]</a>: Like this is going to be a whole new public school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6354.84s">[Mustone]</a>: And I did not think that was the best choice to have a middle person, um, that I think Mr. Velson is, has the knowledge and the history to give our new superintendent and just looking forward that we needed that transition to be smoothly done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6371.329s">[Mustone]</a>: And,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6372.884s">[Mustone]</a>: I know people don't agree with that, but I think it would have been more detrimental to our school system to bring someone in for eight weeks, and I stand by that decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=8300.091s">[Mustone]</a>: I just want to say a parent did email the next day and say, you definitely need to put in the new deputy superintendent's contract that they will step in so that we have to add that because that isn't currently in the contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=8314.419s">[Mustone]</a>: So that doesn't work, which I was a shame on me that I didn't read their contract to know that they did not have to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=8323.974s">[Mustone]</a>: are forced into taking that superintendent's job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=8328.557s">[Mustone]</a>: So that's, we can add that to make sure the next deputy superintendent is their job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9750.353s">[Mustone]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9750.554s">[Mustone]</a>: Mustone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9751.795s">[Mustone]</a>: Back in January when our meeting was in the media studio in the McGlynn<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9758.13s">[Mustone]</a>: teachers spoke about their improvement plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9761.831s">[Mustone]</a>: Someone mentioned almost, I don't want to call it gifted and talented because that's not what they called it, but it was, does this sound familiar to you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9771.255s">[Mustone]</a>: And they were saying that could be a way to attract that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9774.456s">[Mustone]</a>: If you spoke to the four elementary school principals and said maybe you could, kids who want to be pushed more or kids whose parents want to push them more, maybe<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9783.983s">[Mustone]</a>: it was talked about having a program at the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9786.684s">[Mustone]</a>: Does that sound familiar to anyone else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9791.387s">[Mustone]</a>: No, this wasn't a club.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9792.427s">[Mustone]</a>: This was a curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9796.349s">[Mustone]</a>: They would be tracked, more or less.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10052.251s">[Mustone]</a>: More suggestion or just to think about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10055.453s">[Mustone]</a>: So if we did move half the ELL students to the Andrews, the numbers would be equal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10109.496s">[Mustone]</a>: With the Roberts, we had the program grades one through five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10113.839s">[Mustone]</a>: You had the newcomers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10115.019s">[Mustone]</a>: For a few years, we were maxed on physical space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10119.042s">[Mustone]</a>: This year, grades one and two went to the Brooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10121.443s">[Mustone]</a>: Roberts retained three, four, and five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10124.945s">[Mustone]</a>: I haven't heard much feedback one way or the other, but it freed up physical space in our building at the Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10134.75s">[Mustone]</a>: just thinking of the 50 families, well, or 29, who end up not getting what they desired in our school choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10144.432s">[Mustone]</a>: And if you, the Andrews used to have an ELL program, and we have the staffing for it, maybe that's a way to, and Justin, I guess Justin is what made me think of it, is that you don't want the McGlynn to be almost stigmatized, and if the Andrews has it as well, then we're helping there too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10169.419s">[Mustone]</a>: Oh, good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10190.586s">[Mustone]</a>: I know, but we're going to get our hands dirty one way or the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10193.208s">[Mustone]</a>: Either we're going to have 29 really angry families, or we're going to be dirty our hands with staffing with ELL.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10284.36s">[Mustone]</a>: Oh, I understand if we have to hire four additional teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10287.442s">[Mustone]</a>: I understand that if you don't have the staffing, but we're all just trying also.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10606.677s">[Mustone]</a>: But it's not like you said, by Friday, so we can tell the public that the Magdalene will have a principal in September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10611.46s">[Mustone]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11543.04s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=13588.644s">[Mustone]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=13588.784s">[Mustone]</a>: Millstone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=13591.557s">[Mustone]</a>: I think I've never even heard of an adaptive physical education teacher, so that seems very exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=13597.659s">[Mustone]</a>: Is the plan that they would co-teach with Mr. McGlynn at the Roberts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=13603.761s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=13604.041s">[Mustone]</a>: Would they go in and tell Mr. McGlynn or share ideas with Mr. McGlynn and travel the schools or?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=5345.322s">[Mustone]</a>: I was like a mom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=5354.998s">[Mustone]</a>: I would say over the last two and a half years, the most, the highest concern I hear from parents is the maintenance and upkeep of the buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=5363.141s">[Mustone]</a>: And that we almost need to do an inventory of all our buildings and a plan for keeping up on top of the schools every year that we still call them new schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=5374.164s">[Mustone]</a>: This is really the new high school question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=5376.825s">[Mustone]</a>: So I think it would be great to have, you know, every year we do the same checklist that every building needs to stay on top of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=972.085s">[Mustone]</a>: So this is two parts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=973.366s">[Mustone]</a>: One is, what do you think is the primary function of a superintendent nowadays with so many shifting educational requirements?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=982.75s">[Mustone]</a>: And how would you implement your first steps for this priority if you were to be our superintendent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1077.511s">[Mustone]</a>: First steps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1078.212s">[Mustone]</a>: So if you were to be superintendent, what do you think your first steps would be in the new role?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3823.844s">[Mustone]</a>: So another big concern of parents that I received emails is about the upkeep<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3829.167s">[Mustone]</a>: and maintenance of our school buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3831.789s">[Mustone]</a>: So do you have experience with budget for upkeep and maintenance, or is that something that you see in your current BPS?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3841.636s">[Mustone]</a>: Is that something you've dealt with before with your schools that you are the superintendent of?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3915.634s">[Mustone]</a>: So is there a line budget item that says grounds?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4005.961s">[Mustone]</a>: And I know you've had many different roles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4008.202s">[Mustone]</a>: Have you had in one of your roles the responsibility to write a whole school budget and what was that like for you or how did it play out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4105.206s">[Mustone]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4105.786s">[Mustone]</a>: Well, I guess could I just follow up with that, just because you had mentioned community partners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4109.328s">[Mustone]</a>: Can you speak about partnerships that you've created or that you would like to see created in Medford that aren't currently here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7783.941s">[Mustone]</a>: Nice to see you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7784.881s">[Mustone]</a>: Very good to see you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7786.722s">[Mustone]</a>: So I guess my basic question is, what do you see as the primary role of the superintendent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7792.545s">[Mustone]</a>: And then following that, how would you take, what would your first steps be if you were to be the next Medford superintendent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7924.078s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=296.203s">[Mustone]</a>: I would say if you've googled Medford school system, you probably got a lot of articles about communication within the district with parents, with teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=306.11s">[Mustone]</a>: So if you could talk about how you communicate with teachers, administrators, parents, and everyone, and children, and the students, that would be, I would love to hear it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=315.917s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=483.77s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1878.223s">[Mustone]</a>: preschool education, except that it seems like a lot of front lines of newspapers is that four-year-olds should have a universal full-day program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1887.09s">[Mustone]</a>: So I know in Boston it's K1 and K2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1889.672s">[Mustone]</a>: I don't know about North Andover or if it's something you're interested in, if you think it's something we could do here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1894.856s">[Mustone]</a>: I know parents have asked me quite often about a four-year-old program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1899.019s">[Mustone]</a>: So your thoughts, early childhood?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2019.877s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2020.657s">[Mustone]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2021.738s">[Mustone]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2021.918s">[Mustone]</a>: Kritz?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2023.078s">[Mustone]</a>: Hi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4151.896s">[Mustone]</a>: I just have one more question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4153.316s">[Mustone]</a>: Another concern of many parents is the physical space in a capital plan for upkeep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4159.637s">[Mustone]</a>: So our elementary schools and our middle schools are still new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4164.038s">[Mustone]</a>: It's 13 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4166.959s">[Mustone]</a>: But have you worked with the capital plan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4168.599s">[Mustone]</a>: How do you address the building needs, the upkeep, the maintenance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4173.18s">[Mustone]</a>: That's something that comes up often.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4176.24s">[Mustone]</a>: with our buildings?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4310.879s">[Mustone]</a>: Were you part of the writing team for the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4314.081s">[Mustone]</a>: Middle school application.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4317.907s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6688.177s">[Mustone]</a>: Good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6689.042s">[Mustone]</a>: Turn this on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6690.783s">[Mustone]</a>: So I did learn through your resume that you have middle school and high school experience, but we do have four elementary schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6696.869s">[Mustone]</a>: So if you could talk some concerns you have, both your strengths with elementary are tying it in, or concerns of now heading a school system K through 12.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6821.171s">[Mustone]</a>: Can I follow up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6822.172s">[Mustone]</a>: Certainly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6824.033s">[Mustone]</a>: So about early childhood, a lot of surrounding towns are talking about a four-year-old full day, calling it K1, pre-K, K2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6833.421s">[Mustone]</a>: So I don't know if you have thoughts on that or if you see how that could work here in MedFed or if you've<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6839.983s">[Mustone]</a>: have a plan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6866.603s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6867.203s">[Mustone]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6868.744s">[Mustone]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6868.945s">[Mustone]</a>: Kritz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=8534.2s">[Mustone]</a>: You had used the phrase you're an outsider with an insider view.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=8540.308s">[Mustone]</a>: So with that inside view, what would you say is the Medford Public Schools greatest strength and greatest weakness and how would you address the weakness?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=8672.128s">[Mustone]</a>: Just to follow up on that, I know that we've exchanged emails that I had met with the two community directors for Medford and Somerville, and that I was unaware that any student can audit a class that would be high school credit, not Tufts credit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=8686.095s">[Mustone]</a>: And that the woman, Barbara Rugal, said she's had one most of the time, at most a year three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=8692.579s">[Mustone]</a>: And that is something that they are eager to get more partnership going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=8697.161s">[Mustone]</a>: So I'm not saying that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5111.453s">[Mustone]</a>: I just want to share with people at home that the Medford Community Coalition had emailed the school committee and other members in central administration about suggestions they had for communication and safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5129.086s">[Mustone]</a>: So I just want to clarify for them that one of their suggestions was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5134.478s">[Mustone]</a>: to find out if a training was happening with Alice, what's hopefully the timeline so we can say hopefully a professional development day in the near future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5143.68s">[Mustone]</a>: But this is just a short one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5145.38s">[Mustone]</a>: Yeah, an intro is March 21st and then further on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5148.801s">[Mustone]</a>: Their other suggestion was about the safety advisory committee that we had spoken about that is going to fall under the building and grounds subcommittee, which I chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5157.962s">[Mustone]</a>: And we did set a date, thank God, for Doodle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5161.195s">[Mustone]</a>: So our safety advisory committee first meeting will be Thursday night, March 22nd from 7 to 9 at the superintendent's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5169.902s">[Mustone]</a>: It will be posted tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5171.524s">[Mustone]</a>: Everyone is welcome to attend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5175.087s">[Mustone]</a>: And then their other suggestion was just having streamlined communication, which is something that is being addressed and working on with central administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5184.234s">[Mustone]</a>: So I want to thank the Method Community Coalition for giving us those great suggestions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5196.256s">[Mustone]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5196.656s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5241.789s">[Mustone]</a>: I can second it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5242.47s">[Mustone]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5528.55s">[Mustone]</a>: And I guess we'll find out more once we go through training.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5534.033s">[Mustone]</a>: But a friend of mine works in a different district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5536.923s">[Mustone]</a>: She was only trained once for ALICE.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5540.525s">[Mustone]</a>: So it's almost, I don't think you'd have to use a professional development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5543.987s">[Mustone]</a>: It would be for new hires, maybe during their new hire orientation, they would be trained for ALICE.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5549.21s">[Mustone]</a>: She was trained once three years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5550.611s">[Mustone]</a>: She's still a teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5551.531s">[Mustone]</a>: So I don't know if it's something that you have to be trained, it's the same training year after year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5557.114s">[Mustone]</a>: So that's something we can look into.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5558.475s">[Mustone]</a>: So it might not be, it could be part of that week of orientation for new teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5564.765s">[Mustone]</a>: Because I don't, but we'll have to clarify if you have to be retrained every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5626.386s">[Mustone]</a>: So the meeting when you were in Colorado, the chief supported it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5631.688s">[Mustone]</a>: A young man who was an EMT spoke about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5635.289s">[Mustone]</a>: And a mother of three children who professionally is an ALICE trainer spoke very eloquently about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5641.932s">[Mustone]</a>: So that's how it came.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5964.851s">[Mustone]</a>: Stone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5965.091s">[Mustone]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5965.791s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5966.452s">[Mustone]</a>: On the second to last page, just the last sentence, just as we think of pre-budgets, it says, while there are school adjustment Councilors at the elementary level, there may be the need for additional guidance Councilors at that level as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5979.48s">[Mustone]</a>: So is that recommending guidance Councilors for elementary schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5998.364s">[Mustone]</a>: So I know we at the Roberts have an adjustment Councilor that is great and works nonstop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6006.75s">[Mustone]</a>: So she does the social, emotional well-being part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6010.053s">[Mustone]</a>: Are you suggesting a guidance council for elementary for more academic part?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6014.217s">[Mustone]</a>: I'm just not sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6015.298s">[Mustone]</a>: Just to think of staffing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6053.384s">[Mustone]</a>: Does the high school have adjustment Councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6058.806s">[Mustone]</a>: And who does the adjustment Councilors, what department does it fall under?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6061.727s">[Mustone]</a>: Special education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6062.687s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6063.248s">[Mustone]</a>: So that's another budget that we'll hear about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6073.091s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14723.13s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14724.091s">[Mustone]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14724.231s">[Mustone]</a>: Mastone, thank you for your report, both of you for your report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14728.095s">[Mustone]</a>: The last paragraph on the report is, if we were to move either program to the Andrews, there are at least 10 teachers who will need the SEI endorsement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14739.418s">[Mustone]</a>: Organizations such as MatSol, Revis, Steam, I don't know any of them, will do training in the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14744.879s">[Mustone]</a>: The cost is between $8,800 and $12,000 for anywhere from 25 to 30 participants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14750.881s">[Mustone]</a>: So that's new to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14751.681s">[Mustone]</a>: I didn't know that there was a separate training.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14753.822s">[Mustone]</a>: And is it, how long is the training?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14759.813s">[Mustone]</a>: And so these companies will all come to our city and would train the teachers who need this certification?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14803.328s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16010.997s">[Mustone]</a>: At the committee of the whole about the field trip, there was a number of parents from the CPAC organization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16018.745s">[Mustone]</a>: Did you reach out to them to ask them if this was, I don't, they spoke about the language they were looking for that made them feel confident that we were being equitable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16027.374s">[Mustone]</a>: So is that possible?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16028.415s">[Mustone]</a>: I think the chairperson said, could you reach out to me with language, I could help you with language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7137.792s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7138.733s">[Mustone]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7217.994s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8425.591s">[Mustone]</a>: At the committee of the whole about the field trip, there was a number of parents from the CPAC organization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2237.971s">[Mustone]</a>: Stone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2239.092s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you all for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2240.193s">[Mustone]</a>: I do appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2241.474s">[Mustone]</a>: And Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2241.874s">[Mustone]</a>: Haas, am I saying it right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2244.176s">[Mustone]</a>: So one thing that you said that really stood out for me was just looking for support, fundraising, and opportunities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2251.201s">[Mustone]</a>: So if there is steps that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2253.343s">[Mustone]</a>: We can move forward, like this is a great conversation, but it's just the beginning of really getting to what you need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2260.531s">[Mustone]</a>: If you want to, if we could start a regular dialogue, or if you have ideas that you need our support and fundraising and help, we would all be happy to do what you need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2273.164s">[Mustone]</a>: So thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2502.946s">[Mustone]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2503.866s">[Mustone]</a>: Not just administration, we should be there too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3978.899s">[Mustone]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3979.039s">[Mustone]</a>: But if a student says to the mentor, I'm in an unhealthy relationship, I don't know what to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3985.501s">[Mustone]</a>: Does the mentor deal with it or does the mentor say, go talk to Miss Perry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3995.413s">[Mustone]</a>: has that last year where any students referred to you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5957.495s">[Mustone]</a>: She got hit by a boat, carrying a boat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6079.415s">[Mustone]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6081.416s">[Mustone]</a>: If a parent forgets to write on the slip that my child had a concussion last spring, is there a second set of eyes that will tell the coach?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6113.291s">[Mustone]</a>: But I'm saying if the parent forgets to write down the high risk, the nurse will look at the last season of sports?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6126.12s">[Mustone]</a>: Oh, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6430.039s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6431.2s">[Mustone]</a>: Just on the idea of meetings, Joan, who was here earlier with the CPA, she just had mentioned when we were in the lobby, she was just saying it was unfortunate that Wednesday night is the CPA meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6442.649s">[Mustone]</a>: And then it's also the Medford Community Coalition meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6445.63s">[Mustone]</a>: And she said, I almost wish there was a giant Google calendar for all city events.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6450.312s">[Mustone]</a>: And I don't know if that's something that this media center could put.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6453.793s">[Mustone]</a>: So there's one place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6455.074s">[Mustone]</a>: Because she said it's a lot of the same people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6457.475s">[Mustone]</a>: She wouldn't have double booked it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6459.156s">[Mustone]</a>: But is that something this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6461.755s">[Mustone]</a>: Media center could do us community calendar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6489.243s">[Mustone]</a>: Well, the Robert's Ice Cream Social is 6.30, the Andrew's Curriculum Night is 6.30, so someone doesn't get ice cream at my house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2200.999s">[Mustone]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2201.159s">[Mustone]</a>: Stone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3920.124s">[Mustone]</a>: Then if a student, if someone comes looking for help from the student, who does the student then go to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3924.789s">[Mustone]</a>: Because that'd be a pretty heavy topic for a teenager.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3927.512s">[Mustone]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3942.062s">[Mustone]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3942.202s">[Mustone]</a>: But if a student says to the mentor, I'm in an unhealthy relationship, I don't know what to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3963.629s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay, well that's good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5921.029s">[Mustone]</a>: She got hit by a boat, carrying a boat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6393.718s">[Mustone]</a>: Bustow?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6394.238s">[Mustone]</a>: Just on the idea of meetings, Joan, who was here earlier with the CPA, she just had mentioned when we were in the lobby, she was just saying it was unfortunate that Wednesday night is the CPA meeting,<br><br>
