    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14723.13s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14724.091s">[Mustone]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14724.231s">[Mustone]</a>: Mastone, thank you for your report, both of you for your report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14728.095s">[Mustone]</a>: The last paragraph on the report is, if we were to move either program to the Andrews, there are at least 10 teachers who will need the SEI endorsement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14739.418s">[Mustone]</a>: Organizations such as MatSol, Revis, Steam, I don't know any of them, will do training in the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14744.879s">[Mustone]</a>: The cost is between $8,800 and $12,000 for anywhere from 25 to 30 participants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14750.881s">[Mustone]</a>: So that's new to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14751.681s">[Mustone]</a>: I didn't know that there was a separate training.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14753.822s">[Mustone]</a>: And is it, how long is the training?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14759.813s">[Mustone]</a>: And so these companies will all come to our city and would train the teachers who need this certification?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14803.328s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16010.997s">[Mustone]</a>: At the committee of the whole about the field trip, there was a number of parents from the CPAC organization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16018.745s">[Mustone]</a>: Did you reach out to them to ask them if this was, I don't, they spoke about the language they were looking for that made them feel confident that we were being equitable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16027.374s">[Mustone]</a>: So is that possible?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16028.415s">[Mustone]</a>: I think the chairperson said, could you reach out to me with language, I could help you with language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6083.261s">[Mustone]</a>: All right, thanks, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6084.963s">[Mustone]</a>: If I could just ask the students, if you're comfortable, both of you had referred to moving forward and taking action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6090.648s">[Mustone]</a>: Could you tell us what you shared with the administration, what you would like to see happen at the high school, if you feel comfortable?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6098.016s">[Mustone]</a>: Or send me an email with what you shared with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6102.24s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay, great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6188.192s">[Mustone]</a>: One last thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6188.752s">[Mustone]</a>: I know Mr. Cushing talked about staff shortages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6193.074s">[Mustone]</a>: Is there any light at the end of the tunnel for any sort of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6198.863s">[Mustone]</a>: subcontracting with maybe an employment agency, or I know I've heard students talk about hall monitors, which I can't, we don't have enough powers of substitutes, but is there any, I guess, hope for more staff?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1321.709s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Fallon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1322.929s">[Mustone]</a>: I was just wondering, I saw, I don't know if you want to go two slides back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1326.65s">[Mustone]</a>: So last year there was 199 ninth graders who did CTE, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1334.012s">[Mustone]</a>: It jumped to 269 this current year for ninth graders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1342.289s">[Mustone]</a>: How many 10th graders then chose to stay in the vocational school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1346.39s">[Mustone]</a>: Wow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1346.55s">[Mustone]</a>: So that's a very large percentage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1360.217s">[Mustone]</a>: So 160 from say 200, I don't know who has the slides, but so then do you expect, so this current ninth grade class is 269.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1369.725s">[Mustone]</a>: Do you think you'll get 200 students then choosing to the vocational school in 10th grade?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1382.575s">[Mustone]</a>: So then would that lead you to, are you considering adding shops?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1413.658s">[Mustone]</a>: And then do we have any students in Medford who are going to other vocational schools because they're looking for a shop we don't offer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1428.669s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1428.969s">[Mustone]</a>: So it's not like there's something out there that people are looking for at another shop?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1449.229s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1449.569s">[Mustone]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1450.67s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4144.4s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes, member Stone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4148.463s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you for the report, Dr. Cushing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4150.624s">[Mustone]</a>: And I don't know if it's too late to ask if we could share this on the screen just because the class sizes are so low on average in every school in every grade that I know that's always a concern over the years for parents class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4163.293s">[Mustone]</a>: I know when Tegan was in kindergarten, it was 27 and then a fifth class was added to bring it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4170.0s">[Mustone]</a>: But I mean, looking at this, and I'm not a mathematician, it looks like almost the average class size is 20 across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4175.784s">[Mustone]</a>: Would you say that's the average class size?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4179.047s">[Mustone]</a>: Yeah, so I just, I think that's great for, I don't think I've seen it in black and white to realize how great that is for a classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4187.633s">[Mustone]</a>: I know Deckman has 19, so I didn't know if he was the outlier, but that seems like it's the average, so thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4193.597s">[Mustone]</a>: But this is a great, I mean, to share with,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4196.579s">[Mustone]</a>: community to see those numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4199.103s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you, Dr. Pershing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4255.929s">[Mustone]</a>: New enrollments this year, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5048.021s">[Mustone]</a>: So does it automatically they let the kids I mean 65 minutes seems like a long time for a fourth grader under reading to be working on a test.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5058.176s">[Mustone]</a>: So it doesn't cut them off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5059.457s">[Mustone]</a>: It lets them go for as long as they need to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5346.212s">[Mustone]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5346.792s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes, ma'am.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5348.614s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5350.335s">[Mustone]</a>: For the testing times, I think, and I appreciate a lot of this information was what was asked in the resolution back in the spring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5357.8s">[Mustone]</a>: So thank you for putting this all together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5360.602s">[Mustone]</a>: But I think what that question was trying to get at is more, how much of time and learning is this taking away?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5367.691s">[Mustone]</a>: from the classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5369.292s">[Mustone]</a>: So for example, you know, if a classroom, a second grade classroom has, you know, 12 kids who finish in a half an hour and then has seven more that keep going, the teacher's not going to move ahead with the curriculum that day when she knows that seven kids are not going to be able to be with her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5390.379s">[Mustone]</a>: So I'm curious if there's a way at some point in the future to get data<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5395.205s">[Mustone]</a>: more on kind of how much time and learning this takes from the classroom, not just how much individual students or the average student is, you know, to take the test.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5529.138s">[Mustone]</a>: I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5529.558s">[Mustone]</a>: I just, you know, I know that I personally I hear from parents who are concerned about how much testing is being done between the MCAS, this test,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5539.143s">[Mustone]</a>: practice and tasks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5540.423s">[Mustone]</a>: And so just in terms of being able to understand, trying to balance what is the value of the task versus how much time it's taking away from time learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5551.98s">[Mustone]</a>: I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5552.28s">[Mustone]</a>: I agree with you about the data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7178.562s">[Mustone]</a>: Marks just disappeared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8510.322s">[Mustone]</a>: Yeah, thank you for what.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8513.045s">[Mustone]</a>: So, personally, Declan's in fifth grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8516.788s">[Mustone]</a>: And I feel like his writing is not what his older siblings were doing in fifth grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8523.034s">[Mustone]</a>: Is there a writing curriculum that goes along with what's happening now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8527.219s">[Mustone]</a>: Or is that something that you're also looking into?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8631.0s">[Mustone]</a>: My college roommate is a teacher in Boston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8633.76s">[Mustone]</a>: She sent me the podcast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8637.861s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8638.781s">[Mustone]</a>: So we had a conversation not too long ago about it, but also the whole science of reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8644.383s">[Mustone]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8645.888s">[Mustone]</a>: Would you say, because the hybrid year of COVID are going out March of 2020, has the science of reading not been part of professional development?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8695.074s">[Mustone]</a>: So I'm just thinking of my own having kids from 2002 to 2012.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8698.716s">[Mustone]</a>: So Quinn never did phonics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8703.55s">[Mustone]</a>: So she's the 20-year-old.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8705.511s">[Mustone]</a>: So I guess my concern is the teachers who went to school and learned the science of reading, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8712.714s">[Mustone]</a>: I'm getting the, not the phonics part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8891.807s">[Mustone]</a>: Do you think our teachers, because they were teaching the non-phonics version for so long, it's hard to break into now going back to phonics?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8972.66s">[Mustone]</a>: You said you bring it in grade three, you bring it in grade four and five and different cycles or.<br><br>
