    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=168.909s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6500.758s">[Mustone]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=787.589s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2395.325s">[Mustone]</a>: Member Mustone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2396.065s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2396.586s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2398.167s">[Mustone]</a>: I'm just curious about the mini class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2400.289s">[Mustone]</a>: So I think the advantage of that with Mr. Skorka was that he was so accessible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2403.832s">[Mustone]</a>: And he was such a gift to the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2405.954s">[Mustone]</a>: I remember one student saying to me, everyone should have Mr. Skorka in their life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2409.797s">[Mustone]</a>: And I think everyone would agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2411.459s">[Mustone]</a>: So I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2413.36s">[Mustone]</a>: besides that he had a gift and a vocation for that work, are you going to hire someone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2418.584s">[Mustone]</a>: Are you posting, I don't know if his title was formerly assistant director, but I think it's hard to do the work unless you're in a classroom in the hallways with kids because they're coming and going as we all know with teenagers and to pin them down, that was the advantage of the power of Mr. Skorka.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2433.575s">[Mustone]</a>: He was always available for every student all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2451.153s">[Mustone]</a>: So will you replace a lead teacher at the high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2454.415s">[Mustone]</a>: I just think it's hard for kids to get work done when there's not an adult who's always available to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2496.419s">[Mustone]</a>: So will the advisor be the mini course teacher?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2564.041s">[Mustone]</a>: It does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2564.641s">[Mustone]</a>: I don't think it's going to be as successful with not having a lead teacher as the advisor because he was just always available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2572.686s">[Mustone]</a>: I mean, I just know from my own senior who had been very involved and from her classmates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2578.629s">[Mustone]</a>: So I guess my recommendation would be ideal if the advisor was the lead teacher because then the kids have wonderful ideas that take a lot of footwork to get them happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=2588.314s">[Mustone]</a>: So that's my only concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=3026.436s">[Mustone]</a>: That one's from Amazon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TYJHfPvQgEo&t=3336.979s">[Mustone]</a>: I also think Mr. Jackson sounds like a great candidate for the CCSR advisor program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZOridbGJ9hA&t=139.9s">[Mustone]</a>: I am sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZOridbGJ9hA&t=140.72s">[Mustone]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZOridbGJ9hA&t=1452.34s">[Mustone]</a>: Melanie, just, sorry, I'm on my phone, which I'm not used to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZOridbGJ9hA&t=1454.942s">[Mustone]</a>: So I'm taking a little minute to get used to doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZOridbGJ9hA&t=1458.964s">[Mustone]</a>: I agree with everyone that everyone's saying, and it's, I can't believe we don't already do all this for our parents and making sure all the kids are included in all the school activities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZOridbGJ9hA&t=1468.791s">[Mustone]</a>: So I just, I'm trying to be clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZOridbGJ9hA&t=1470.973s">[Mustone]</a>: Are we writing a policy to just like, is it looking for funding to make sure that staff's available for like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZOridbGJ9hA&t=1479.903s">[Mustone]</a>: What do we need to do to make this happen that everything is available for all the kids?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZOridbGJ9hA&t=3098.681s">[Mustone]</a>: Second, Melanie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZOridbGJ9hA&t=3209.873s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZOridbGJ9hA&t=3212.738s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZOridbGJ9hA&t=3215.02s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4548.507s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4549.468s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4549.949s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you member Graham every stone tour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4552.212s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you for connecting with everyone over the last week that's great to reach out to the formal and the rec department, I'm excited about them starting a youth track program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4560.121s">[Mustone]</a>: And I'm just wondering is there coach app or job website for coaches specifically I know it's posted on NPS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4568.763s">[Mustone]</a>: And is it posted on school spring or spring school yet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4595.975s">[Mustone]</a>: And is it that you've looked and there's no, I don't know about coaches.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=4599.136s">[Mustone]</a>: I just don't imagine there would be a specific coaching.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7056.76s">[Mustone]</a>: I can wait if you're going off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7120.579s">[Mustone]</a>: No, I was just going to say, could one of the goals be to expand our finance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7126.762s">[Mustone]</a>: I love that in the budgetary priorities, you have a theater teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7131.425s">[Mustone]</a>: So I think just the option of expanding or the goal of expanding more theater electives, both in the middle school and the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7140.269s">[Mustone]</a>: And if we could even increase<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7142.489s">[Mustone]</a>: the music options in the middle school and the high school, which of course would take on more staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7147.17s">[Mustone]</a>: But I really think we've all received a number of emails with all the benefits of theater and music for students, both in the middle school and the high school level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=7156.791s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=9148.859s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=9150.081s">[Mustone]</a>: Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=9151.013s">[Mustone]</a>: Member Mustone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=9152.734s">[Mustone]</a>: I might've missed it for old business, but last week the student rep Noah had brought up about the locked bathrooms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=9159.657s">[Mustone]</a>: And I don't remember if there was gonna be a follow-up about the schedule of the bathrooms, locked bathrooms, or just to respond to Noah's inquiry about when they're locked or when they're unlocked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=904.487s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=906.529s">[Mustone]</a>: Two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=907.149s">[Mustone]</a>: One is to Member Graham's point about that we might not all be there because there'll be an election in November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=911.972s">[Mustone]</a>: I want to say this will be my last term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=913.933s">[Mustone]</a>: So for community members and parents out there, please consider running or consider encouraging friends and family to run.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=920.557s">[Mustone]</a>: It's been a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=923.158s">[Mustone]</a>: An interesting seven and a half years and I think eight years is a good time for a public servant to bow out and let pass on the torch to someone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=932.406s">[Mustone]</a>: And the next one is that recently we've had many emails about arts and music and the benefits to children and teens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=941.174s">[Mustone]</a>: So I think I'd like a goal to be almost a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=944.597s">[Mustone]</a>: a deep dive into our finance department and see if there's places we can expand or ideas that other schools are incorporating that are successful that we could look into.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=954.087s">[Mustone]</a>: But in addition,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=956.768s">[Mustone]</a>: I was able to go to two of the concerts in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=960.209s">[Mustone]</a>: I don't even know what month we're in, but they were wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=962.809s">[Mustone]</a>: And the parents all there and grandparents all had such wonderful things to say about the fine arts department and the music.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=968.671s">[Mustone]</a>: And I know the music department has started the jumpstart camp and has expanded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=972.431s">[Mustone]</a>: And I think it's been beneficial to everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=974.932s">[Mustone]</a>: So just, I think expanding fine arts would be a goal for myself and a lot of parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=980.973s">[Mustone]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6058.864s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you very much for all that information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h2JMIPnvYME&t=6060.966s">[Mustone]</a>: Is there any conversation about adding another language to the world language department I know in the past people had emailed, both for Chinese Arabic, or even sign language and I didn't know if that was a conversation to expand the languages we offer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8510.322s">[Mustone]</a>: Yeah, thank you for what.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8513.045s">[Mustone]</a>: So, personally, Declan's in fifth grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8516.788s">[Mustone]</a>: And I feel like his writing is not what his older siblings were doing in fifth grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8523.034s">[Mustone]</a>: Is there a writing curriculum that goes along with what's happening now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8527.219s">[Mustone]</a>: Or is that something that you're also looking into?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8631.0s">[Mustone]</a>: My college roommate is a teacher in Boston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8633.76s">[Mustone]</a>: She sent me the podcast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8637.861s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8638.781s">[Mustone]</a>: So we had a conversation not too long ago about it, but also the whole science of reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8644.383s">[Mustone]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8645.888s">[Mustone]</a>: Would you say, because the hybrid year of COVID are going out March of 2020, has the science of reading not been part of professional development?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8695.074s">[Mustone]</a>: So I'm just thinking of my own having kids from 2002 to 2012.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8698.716s">[Mustone]</a>: So Quinn never did phonics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8703.55s">[Mustone]</a>: So she's the 20-year-old.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8705.511s">[Mustone]</a>: So I guess my concern is the teachers who went to school and learned the science of reading, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8712.714s">[Mustone]</a>: I'm getting the, not the phonics part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8891.807s">[Mustone]</a>: Do you think our teachers, because they were teaching the non-phonics version for so long, it's hard to break into now going back to phonics?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8972.66s">[Mustone]</a>: You said you bring it in grade three, you bring it in grade four and five and different cycles or.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4144.4s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes, member Stone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4148.463s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you for the report, Dr. Cushing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4150.624s">[Mustone]</a>: And I don't know if it's too late to ask if we could share this on the screen just because the class sizes are so low on average in every school in every grade that I know that's always a concern over the years for parents class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4163.293s">[Mustone]</a>: I know when Tegan was in kindergarten, it was 27 and then a fifth class was added to bring it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4170.0s">[Mustone]</a>: But I mean, looking at this, and I'm not a mathematician, it looks like almost the average class size is 20 across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4175.784s">[Mustone]</a>: Would you say that's the average class size?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4179.047s">[Mustone]</a>: Yeah, so I just, I think that's great for, I don't think I've seen it in black and white to realize how great that is for a classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4187.633s">[Mustone]</a>: I know Deckman has 19, so I didn't know if he was the outlier, but that seems like it's the average, so thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4193.597s">[Mustone]</a>: But this is a great, I mean, to share with,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4196.579s">[Mustone]</a>: community to see those numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4199.103s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you, Dr. Pershing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4255.929s">[Mustone]</a>: New enrollments this year, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5048.021s">[Mustone]</a>: So does it automatically they let the kids I mean 65 minutes seems like a long time for a fourth grader under reading to be working on a test.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5058.176s">[Mustone]</a>: So it doesn't cut them off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5059.457s">[Mustone]</a>: It lets them go for as long as they need to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5346.212s">[Mustone]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5346.792s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes, ma'am.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5348.614s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5350.335s">[Mustone]</a>: For the testing times, I think, and I appreciate a lot of this information was what was asked in the resolution back in the spring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5357.8s">[Mustone]</a>: So thank you for putting this all together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5360.602s">[Mustone]</a>: But I think what that question was trying to get at is more, how much of time and learning is this taking away?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5367.691s">[Mustone]</a>: from the classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5369.292s">[Mustone]</a>: So for example, you know, if a classroom, a second grade classroom has, you know, 12 kids who finish in a half an hour and then has seven more that keep going, the teacher's not going to move ahead with the curriculum that day when she knows that seven kids are not going to be able to be with her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5390.379s">[Mustone]</a>: So I'm curious if there's a way at some point in the future to get data<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5395.205s">[Mustone]</a>: more on kind of how much time and learning this takes from the classroom, not just how much individual students or the average student is, you know, to take the test.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5529.138s">[Mustone]</a>: I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5529.558s">[Mustone]</a>: I just, you know, I know that I personally I hear from parents who are concerned about how much testing is being done between the MCAS, this test,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5539.143s">[Mustone]</a>: practice and tasks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5540.423s">[Mustone]</a>: And so just in terms of being able to understand, trying to balance what is the value of the task versus how much time it's taking away from time learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5551.98s">[Mustone]</a>: I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5552.28s">[Mustone]</a>: I agree with you about the data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7178.562s">[Mustone]</a>: Marks just disappeared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1f4Nwqi6Ka4&t=4119.758s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes, Member Mustone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1f4Nwqi6Ka4&t=4123.802s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you for the report, Dr. Cushing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1f4Nwqi6Ka4&t=4125.965s">[Mustone]</a>: And I don't know if it's too late to ask if we could share this on the screen just because the class sizes are so low on average in every school in every grade that I know that's always a concern over the years for parents class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1f4Nwqi6Ka4&t=4138.638s">[Mustone]</a>: I know when Tegan was in kindergarten, it was 27 and then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1f4Nwqi6Ka4&t=4143.237s">[Mustone]</a>: fifth class was added to bring it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1f4Nwqi6Ka4&t=4145.338s">[Mustone]</a>: But I mean, looking at this, and I'm not a mathematician, it looks like almost the average class size is 20 across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1f4Nwqi6Ka4&t=4151.12s">[Mustone]</a>: Would you say that's the average class size?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1f4Nwqi6Ka4&t=4154.381s">[Mustone]</a>: Yeah, so I just, I think that's great for, I don't think I've seen it in black and white to realize how great that is for classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1f4Nwqi6Ka4&t=4162.965s">[Mustone]</a>: I know Declan has 19, so I didn't know if he was the outlier, but that seems like it's the average.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1f4Nwqi6Ka4&t=4167.727s">[Mustone]</a>: So thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1f4Nwqi6Ka4&t=4168.927s">[Mustone]</a>: But this is a great, I mean, to share with,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1f4Nwqi6Ka4&t=4171.923s">[Mustone]</a>: community to see those numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1f4Nwqi6Ka4&t=4174.447s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1f4Nwqi6Ka4&t=4281.735s">[Mustone]</a>: Member Ruseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4498.957s">[Mustone]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4499.097s">[Mustone]</a>: Stone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4500.398s">[Mustone]</a>: So three of our kids are going on the trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4503.519s">[Mustone]</a>: I will be not chaperoning for a 24-hour train ride, but if you do get Southwest, then I would like to volunteer to chaperone if you get that flight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=4512.683s">[Mustone]</a>: So thank you, but Teague and Nevin and Rowan seem to be very excited that they think it's the Orient Express that they're going on to Florida.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=11985.797s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=11986.84s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you everybody for all the presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=11989.262s">[Mustone]</a>: I do feel like I'm kind of in a time warp because it was probably more than five years ago, or maybe just about, I don't think many people in this room were there then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=11998.147s">[Mustone]</a>: There was a concern with MCAS that the Brooks had nailed it in every area, in every grade, in every subject, and unfortunately other schools did not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12006.412s">[Mustone]</a>: And what came up was Title I, the three schools had Title I, but the Brooks still had a reading specialist that did the work of Title I, but wasn't paid for by Title I.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12015.109s">[Mustone]</a>: At the Roberts, I know firsthand, oh, I can figure it out, because Quinn was in second grade, and now she's a sophomore in college.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12019.852s">[Mustone]</a>: So that's how long ago it was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12021.513s">[Mustone]</a>: So she tested for Title I. Unfortunately, she was not the lowest of the seven that made it to Title I. So her teacher said, unfortunately, she's not the lowest of the seven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12032.44s">[Mustone]</a>: You're right, she definitely has a reading hiccup.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12035.402s">[Mustone]</a>: So I said, so if she was in another class or another school, she might have been the lowest of the seven, depending who her peers were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12041.966s">[Mustone]</a>: So I think, and tell me if I'm not saying what people are thinking, but I think that's where the concern is like we have schools that have much greater need, but they still have the same staff as the Brooks who's doing great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12055.457s">[Mustone]</a>: So I think that's where the frustrations coming from like shouldn't we put the support for the school that might have 14 kids who really need title one but only seven of them are eligible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12204.881s">[Mustone]</a>: And right, we have math.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12206.843s">[Mustone]</a>: Remember what the yeah, the teacher had been out and then the replacement was out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12221.852s">[Mustone]</a>: But no, but it's a good conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12247.774s">[Mustone]</a>: That's good news too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12255.964s">[Mustone]</a>: You said they're back?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12256.864s">[Mustone]</a>: Sorry, I thought you meant they increased their numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12273.248s">[Mustone]</a>: So more support should go there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12275.189s">[Mustone]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12400.864s">[Mustone]</a>: Do you want me to read?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12402.787s">[Mustone]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12403.247s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12403.928s">[Mustone]</a>: You want to go home?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=12466.153s">[Mustone]</a>: Are the meetings in person at the high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-RMDQnsaHK4&t=13671.065s">[Mustone]</a>: Is 46 the one that goes to the subcommittee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1321.709s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Fallon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1322.929s">[Mustone]</a>: I was just wondering, I saw, I don't know if you want to go two slides back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1326.65s">[Mustone]</a>: So last year there was 199 ninth graders who did CTE, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1334.012s">[Mustone]</a>: It jumped to 269 this current year for ninth graders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1342.289s">[Mustone]</a>: How many 10th graders then chose to stay in the vocational school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1346.39s">[Mustone]</a>: Wow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1346.55s">[Mustone]</a>: So that's a very large percentage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1360.217s">[Mustone]</a>: So 160 from say 200, I don't know who has the slides, but so then do you expect, so this current ninth grade class is 269.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1369.725s">[Mustone]</a>: Do you think you'll get 200 students then choosing to the vocational school in 10th grade?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1382.575s">[Mustone]</a>: So then would that lead you to, are you considering adding shops?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1413.658s">[Mustone]</a>: And then do we have any students in Medford who are going to other vocational schools because they're looking for a shop we don't offer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1428.669s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1428.969s">[Mustone]</a>: So it's not like there's something out there that people are looking for at another shop?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1449.229s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1449.569s">[Mustone]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1450.67s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/U-vb-ame39Y&t=92.249s">[Mustone]</a>: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=93.385s">[Mustone]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=95.426s">[Mustone]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=177.614s">[Mustone]</a>: On the calendar, does it say July 3rd, when?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=183.211s">[Mustone]</a>: Oh, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=183.971s">[Mustone]</a>: That's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=413.178s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=413.538s">[Mustone]</a>: I'm happy with my evaluation and I haven't heard anyone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=417.278s">[Mustone]</a>: I'm just going by the emails that were sent to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=419.479s">[Mustone]</a>: So I also just thought we were, it was Melanie who felt like that they are Melanie didn't feel like she, um, fills out the evaluation correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=427.86s">[Mustone]</a>: And so that's why we're meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=429.06s">[Mustone]</a>: And then it was just to make her changes to be put in for the average score, I guess, because we didn't, I didn't see anyone else's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=437.662s">[Mustone]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=930.524s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4951.145s">[Mustone]</a>: Hi, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4951.886s">[Mustone]</a>: I think we're probably wrapping up since it's 528.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4954.448s">[Mustone]</a>: But two points, which I wasn't sure if other people are going to touch upon them before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4958.532s">[Mustone]</a>: I didn't want to repeat my colleagues sentiment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4962.255s">[Mustone]</a>: For communication, I know teachers have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4965.367s">[Mustone]</a>: spoke to me about just more communication directly with the teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4969.632s">[Mustone]</a>: We do all appreciate the newsletter for the families, but maybe there could be a separate newsletter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4974.456s">[Mustone]</a>: It doesn't have to be weekly, maybe monthly, just for the teachers to know what's happened academically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4980.622s">[Mustone]</a>: Schedule-wise for the different grade levels, or maybe some points of information that are coming down from DESE.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=4988.473s">[Mustone]</a>: So, teachers on across the board know where you are coming with with your vision or your goals I think that would be helpful so they all know why things are getting implemented because this is what you're hoping to do to benefit public schools to make them better for every child which I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5004.693s">[Mustone]</a>: I know without a doubt that you are thinking of every child every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5008.556s">[Mustone]</a>: And the second part is now that COVID is subsiding and that we can, I know you love to do the data stuff and that we have science that is rolled out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5020.385s">[Mustone]</a>: We have math that is mid rolled out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5022.767s">[Mustone]</a>: And now also, now it's time to look at the English for,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5029.438s">[Mustone]</a>: ELA for all grades and for social studies slash history slash civics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5037.082s">[Mustone]</a>: But I think now that we have more time because you have less responsibility with COVID decisions, which you had to make those on a daily basis, that I think parents, those are my two things that parents have said to me recently, is now talk about English, social studies, and teaches more communication directly with the teachers<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5058.58s">[Mustone]</a>: And that's, I think other than that, I know you are on the clock 24 hours a day, every day of the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5065.322s">[Mustone]</a>: And I think most of the community understands that and appreciates that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5071.123s">[Mustone]</a>: So I just look forward to now, you know, I guess going back to when you were hired and your goals then, now, you know, you were slowed down with COVID, but now you can kick it back into gear and it's exciting to see what Medford Public Schools are gonna go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5086.287s">[Mustone]</a>: So thank you, Dr. Maurice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5139.878s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5140.198s">[Mustone]</a>: We're all on the same team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2457.464s">[Mustone]</a>: I also want to just thank you all because I think it's been years that you were lobbying for the adaptive physical education teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2465.461s">[Mustone]</a>: And this past year has been awesome with the United basketball program that I know Miss Kyla Andre ran.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2470.985s">[Mustone]</a>: And so I just want people to know that CPAC really gets stuff done and that if they're looking to get something done to join your group, because you guys are the best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=2478.79s">[Mustone]</a>: So thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=10886.2s">[Mustone]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=10886.861s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=10887.382s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=10888.106s">[Mustone]</a>: Remember Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=10888.546s">[Mustone]</a>: Stone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=10889.007s">[Mustone]</a>: I just have to say thank you that Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=10890.968s">[Mustone]</a>: Frito taught four of our six kids for first grade and taught them all how to read.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=10895.391s">[Mustone]</a>: And I appreciate that foundation that she gave them all that they still talk about you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=10899.954s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=10900.415s">[Mustone]</a>: So thank you for being there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=13155.913s">[Mustone]</a>: It appears that all of us are hearing it for the first time, except for member Graham and possible member Rousseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=13161.778s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay, so I don't feel comfortable voting on the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=13164.56s">[Mustone]</a>: I thought we were just voting on the budget tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=13166.262s">[Mustone]</a>: That's what I would like to vote on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=13168.464s">[Mustone]</a>: If you want to put that forth as yourself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=13312.089s">[Mustone]</a>: A motion to approve the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=13316.31s">[Mustone]</a>: Close to 69 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=13422.579s">[Mustone]</a>: And I know we do have a letter that was sent out on June 2 to Senator Lewis, the Massachusetts healthy school lunch coalition reached out to ask for us to support their Massachusetts healthy<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=13437.489s">[Mustone]</a>: healthy school lunch HG 3, 1, 5, 9, SD 1, 3, 0, 8, co sponsored by Senator Jason Lewis and representative Alice Pache.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=13446.595s">[Mustone]</a>: The health of our children is built on a foundation of high quality nutrition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=13449.557s">[Mustone]</a>: Every meal they're served is an opportunity to help them build healthy habits for life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=13453.139s">[Mustone]</a>: The Massachusetts Healthy School Lunch Bill calls to replace disease promoting foods typically served for lunch with healthful and planet friendly whole foods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=13460.664s">[Mustone]</a>: It also holds food service companies accountable to ensure the nutritional quality of school food is prioritized over profit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=13467.833s">[Mustone]</a>: It is time to address inequitable diet-related disease in children's health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=13472.195s">[Mustone]</a>: And this is asking the legislation will provide much-needed nutrition security for the more than 500,000 students who rely on school lunches each day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mo_l7RopgYo&t=13481.178s">[Mustone]</a>: And I'm asking everyone to support this important legislation and send it to Senator Jason M. Lewis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=3960.502s">[Mustone]</a>: Mr. Zizzo has his hand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=4054.881s">[Mustone]</a>: I just had a question that I know that a different compost company has the city of Medford contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=4060.465s">[Mustone]</a>: We can check with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=4061.145s">[Mustone]</a>: So I don't know if they would give us a discount because they have the whole city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=4064.027s">[Mustone]</a>: So if we could look into that, I'm happy to call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=4066.929s">[Mustone]</a>: Yep, we definitely can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=4068.19s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=4827.836s">[Mustone]</a>: Derek, are you Derek?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=4828.977s">[Mustone]</a>: All right, so Derek and I haven't met in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=4830.738s">[Mustone]</a>: So Derek is a dad who has some words he'd like to share if there could be a suspension to hear from him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yrx76KKBXT8&t=10980.221s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k23Jlj002f0&t=8099.123s">[Mustone]</a>: Mayor Lungo-Koehn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=7.043s">[Mustone]</a>: I'm not sure if someone can remove Declan's name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=9.825s">[Mustone]</a>: I, of course, can't figure it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=12.427s">[Mustone]</a>: I was from a CCD class on Sunday morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=171.068s">[Mustone]</a>: Just did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UKy15P8nAPo&t=317.793s">[Mustone]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5409.072s">[Mustone]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=3674.538s">[Mustone]</a>: There is a bus line item budget for the Machi band.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=3676.98s">[Mustone]</a>: I know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5169.874s">[Mustone]</a>: Stone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5170.834s">[Mustone]</a>: I understand it's a lot when you just read it out loud, but I also know that since I've been on for six years, we have been asking to have a system like the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5179.577s">[Mustone]</a>: So we know, just thinking right now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5182.535s">[Mustone]</a>: We talked about the McGlynn roof that kindergarten classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5185.297s">[Mustone]</a>: I'm imagining it got fixed because we haven't heard from parents or teachers, but we never got an official response back from that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5191.902s">[Mustone]</a>: We had students here about the bathrooms at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5194.264s">[Mustone]</a>: We hear that they're getting built.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5195.825s">[Mustone]</a>: We haven't had an update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5196.946s">[Mustone]</a>: There's no way to look for me to say to parents when they reach out to me, oh, yep, the bathrooms are coming in May of 2022.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5203.732s">[Mustone]</a>: We had the girls locker room that parents emailed regularly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5207.716s">[Mustone]</a>: Unfortunately, the students at the high school is still telling me that the locker room has not had a great facelift that it's still looking similar to that it looked in September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5217.026s">[Mustone]</a>: So, I understand when you read it out loud but I feel like those are quick entries of a date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5224.577s">[Mustone]</a>: the person who said it, the meeting time for the subcommittee, but it is frustrating as a school committee member that parents email us repeatedly and we don't have answers for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5236.123s">[Mustone]</a>: And I think it's just almost getting into the habit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5239.125s">[Mustone]</a>: Everything is hard at the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5241.146s">[Mustone]</a>: And then we kind of get into a flow with school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5243.367s">[Mustone]</a>: We'll say the things more clearly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5245.168s">[Mustone]</a>: So the minutes can be more clear for the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5250.031s">[Mustone]</a>: minute takers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5252.317s">[Mustone]</a>: So I do think this is something that's very necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5254.704s">[Mustone]</a>: I don't know if there was a first if I can be the second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Lh9iUewuUkw&t=5258.2s">[Mustone]</a>: There is a motion on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zg4eBCSCY8E&t=4330.623s">[Mustone]</a>: $50,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zg4eBCSCY8E&t=4330.923s">[Mustone]</a>: So I think for anyone interested in robotics and engineering, the laser cutter is amazing and we'll have a lot of future engineers because of that program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zg4eBCSCY8E&t=4341.27s">[Mustone]</a>: And the teachers too, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zg4eBCSCY8E&t=4343.011s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zg4eBCSCY8E&t=4344.172s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zg4eBCSCY8E&t=5204.466s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zg4eBCSCY8E&t=5205.533s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you for volunteering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zg4eBCSCY8E&t=5206.633s">[Mustone]</a>: I'm just wondering, is the school administration part of this group at present?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zg4eBCSCY8E&t=5212.695s">[Mustone]</a>: Or have you talked to Chief Buckley?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zg4eBCSCY8E&t=5221.817s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zg4eBCSCY8E&t=5223.357s">[Mustone]</a>: Do you want- Member Grant?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zg4eBCSCY8E&t=5228.378s">[Mustone]</a>: And then, member Rousseau, because we're taught with the masks associated school committees,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zg4eBCSCY8E&t=5235.987s">[Mustone]</a>: You can't represent us right or you can't speak as a school committee member you're going to report back to us to make sure what they're proposing follows education law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3695.67s">[Mustone]</a>: Member of the stone and it's your just a quick question I don't in past years with after-school programs like the handshines<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3704.316s">[Mustone]</a>: that kids who did the YMCA afterschool program weren't available to, didn't have the transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3709.979s">[Mustone]</a>: Can kids who go to the YMCA at Chevalier be able to take a late bus there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3714.881s">[Mustone]</a>: Just to make that clear to families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3716.482s">[Mustone]</a>: Each school will have one late bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3718.703s">[Mustone]</a>: And their own late bus to whatever stop they need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3721.304s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3721.584s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4525.415s">[Mustone]</a>: Member miss stone, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4528.306s">[Mustone]</a>: How do students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4529.537s">[Mustone]</a>: Do they self-identify that they want to do the math program or would math teachers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4563.098s">[Mustone]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4563.418s">[Mustone]</a>: So students who struggle with math, and this is, I'm speaking as a parent of kids who struggle with math, it would be hard to sell them on five hours a day of math over a vacation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=4576.321s">[Mustone]</a>: So is there some sort of incentive we can give to the students who participate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=484.822s">[Mustone]</a>: I think in the past that the mayor had gone with what people thought were priorities and then named the subcommittees and then asked each of us which subcommittees we would like to be on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=496.353s">[Mustone]</a>: I know the subcommittees have changed by title with different concerns that have come up in the previous year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OqhVXheg_Mw&t=502.94s">[Mustone]</a>: So I would say put the mayor for designating the names of the subcommittees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=40.746s">[Mustone]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=42.507s">[Mustone]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=54.27s">[Mustone]</a>: I pledge allegiance to the flag<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=63.218s">[Mustone]</a>: and justice for all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1788.817s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you for being here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1790.018s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1791.238s">[Mustone]</a>: The part about reviewing the instructional practices policies, anything written, do you like highlight it and say, this needs to be worked on and give us a revision or do you leave us to do the revisioning?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1864.913s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1865.554s">[Mustone]</a>: So Dr. Maurice, do you think the recommendations that we are given by the equity process come May, would they go to the Racial Equity Committee to put them into action or will we address that later on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1924.033s">[Mustone]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1924.493s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1926.275s">[Mustone]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=1926.835s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8683.882s">[Mustone]</a>: I'm not sure if it's for Mr. Cushing or Dr. Maurice, but have the engagement specialist have a better handle on absenteeism, which I know some kids, because of retention or absence, end up going to summer school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=8701.093s">[Mustone]</a>: So do you know if that is the attendance better with engagement specialists this year in place?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9653.49s">[Mustone]</a>: Sorry, I had my hand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9654.671s">[Mustone]</a>: Oh, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9655.231s">[Mustone]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9655.651s">[Mustone]</a>: I didn't see it, I didn't see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9658.272s">[Mustone]</a>: Member Ruseau, is, just because it's worthy,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9662.966s">[Mustone]</a>: Can people, I know on the last meeting, people could still write to us, to the school committee email.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=9672.028s">[Mustone]</a>: I'm one ahead, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10654.131s">[Mustone]</a>: That doesn't help, the people not on the Rules Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=10656.212s">[Mustone]</a>: Yeah, I was gonna say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11205.434s">[Mustone]</a>: I think we all get very tired when we have those meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11217.762s">[Mustone]</a>: Wednesday's not going to be there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12643.156s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=12644.518s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6083.261s">[Mustone]</a>: All right, thanks, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6084.963s">[Mustone]</a>: If I could just ask the students, if you're comfortable, both of you had referred to moving forward and taking action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6090.648s">[Mustone]</a>: Could you tell us what you shared with the administration, what you would like to see happen at the high school, if you feel comfortable?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6098.016s">[Mustone]</a>: Or send me an email with what you shared with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6102.24s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay, great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6188.192s">[Mustone]</a>: One last thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6188.752s">[Mustone]</a>: I know Mr. Cushing talked about staff shortages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6193.074s">[Mustone]</a>: Is there any light at the end of the tunnel for any sort of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6198.863s">[Mustone]</a>: subcontracting with maybe an employment agency, or I know I've heard students talk about hall monitors, which I can't, we don't have enough powers of substitutes, but is there any, I guess, hope for more staff?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=92.65s">[Mustone]</a>: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=99.714s">[Mustone]</a>: one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1994.219s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1995.32s">[Mustone]</a>: There are a number of seventh graders on Zoom, global scholars who have a petition for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2000.485s">[Mustone]</a>: So if there could be a suspension of the rules to have the students on Zoom make their petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2018.174s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11292.851s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12689.591s">[Mustone]</a>: Missituk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12772.133s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12960.505s">[Mustone]</a>: I believe on city Council when they have e-mails, they just put the name and address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12967.408s">[Mustone]</a>: I couldn't hear your motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15769.64s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15771.26s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15773.081s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19146.596s">[Mustone]</a>: But we've got other things, too, that we want on the yes or nos.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19150.479s">[Mustone]</a>: I'm just trying to figure out where they're available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=169.459s">[Mustone]</a>: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5235.783s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8770.601s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes, I also signed on to the resolution with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8773.513s">[Mustone]</a>: Member Ruseau and Member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8777.054s">[Mustone]</a>: And I want to say the reason why we proposed it is because as we've learned of Columbus's legacy in recent times with more research and history, we realized that is not someone that we would like to hold up in a standard for our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8792.82s">[Mustone]</a>: Most people know I have six children, four in Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8796.801s">[Mustone]</a>: He is not someone that I want my children to think that's who we want to represent a school in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8805.284s">[Mustone]</a>: We've heard a lot of conversation on both sides tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8809.366s">[Mustone]</a>: I've had personal conversation with a number of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8811.987s">[Mustone]</a>: I have thought about it thoroughly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8814.328s">[Mustone]</a>: And I know that there are many other opportunities to name a school and that we're not erasing history.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8825.094s">[Mustone]</a>: It's that he is not someone that represents what I wanna teach my children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8830.358s">[Mustone]</a>: I agree that he was a navigator, but other than that, there's nothing that I wanna encourage my children to say, this is someone that we admire and someone that I want you to look up to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8842.367s">[Mustone]</a>: So I think that's how I agreed with my family discussing it that I signed on with Mr. Russo and Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8849.232s">[Mustone]</a>: McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8850.413s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17786.751s">[Mustone]</a>: That'd be a big committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18155.394s">[Mustone]</a>: I did not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18160.772s">[Mustone]</a>: Sorry, I just, I mean, I can see that if they get many names, I know with all the emails we got, I would say we probably were maybe 30 to 40 names were suggested in the emails we received over the last nine months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18179.718s">[Mustone]</a>: So then this is opened up to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18182.975s">[Mustone]</a>: I wonder if it will be a large number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18184.896s">[Mustone]</a>: So no, I mean on the advisory committee, how many, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18188.737s">[Mustone]</a>: If we're thinking about how much work they each have to do, they each get divvied up 40 names each to just, you know, Google their name and see what their story is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18195.94s">[Mustone]</a>: Um, so probably 20.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20730.677s">[Mustone]</a>: Sure, thank you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20736.141s">[Mustone]</a>: For number 15, if the advisory committee recommends a timeline change, which I hear what Kathy's saying, for the time crunch it is now, could it be that in the meantime, that we will refer to the Columbus School with the temporary name of the South Medford Elementary School?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20760.765s">[Mustone]</a>: So then it feels like we're moving forward, it's temporary, but if an extension is asked, if the advisory committee asked for an extension at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20899.039s">[Mustone]</a>: No, I mean, my heart is with the Mystic, but for this process, I think just to be able to move forward with a temporary name while the advisory committee asks for more time, the South Medford Elementary School buys us more time with also recognizing that we are no longer honoring Columbus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=292.807s">[Mustone]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=335.67s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=949.659s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=4310.277s">[Mustone]</a>: Member Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11258.72s">[Mustone]</a>: Member Mustone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11259.4s">[Mustone]</a>: That's what I was going to suggest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11260.561s">[Mustone]</a>: Because I know you're at the wire on Friday night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11262.962s">[Mustone]</a>: But I think even if they're uploaded by 5 o'clock on Monday, people can check it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11268.684s">[Mustone]</a>: have it with them when they're on their phone here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3653.565s">[Mustone]</a>: I just wanted to ask, so usually when something's too good to be true, it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3657.646s">[Mustone]</a>: So with Lexia letting us use it for free, does that mean in June we have to budget for $500,000 for this program?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3707.372s">[Mustone]</a>: And then what's dibbles per student?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3723.959s">[Mustone]</a>: »» Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3724.62s">[Mustone]</a>: So they are screeners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3737.0s">[Mustone]</a>: So are we looking at them together then, or are we looking at them separately?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3763.256s">[Mustone]</a>: So does DIBL and MAP?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3765.586s">[Mustone]</a>: and Rapid sell an intervention program like Lexia does?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3775.61s">[Mustone]</a>: I'm just wondering, are we choosing it because it's free, or are we choosing it because it's the best option for the screeners?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3808.026s">[Mustone]</a>: So I guess if the trial is for the year, and hopefully we learn which kids need the intervention, and then we will be looking then to use their intervention, the core five, then we do have to budget for $40 a student per year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3824.69s">[Mustone]</a>: for this program if this is what we use?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3850.049s">[Mustone]</a>: Right, and I guess, I'm sorry I'm being cynical, and I owe that to Paul, because he says there's big money in education, and he's right, because he made me read a book about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3860.619s">[Mustone]</a>: So I guess I'm just doubtful that, what is, is Lexia, is this really the best option out there, or do they market themselves so well, and give it to people for a year for free, that we end up thinking it's the best and we use it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3906.594s">[Mustone]</a>: And I'm not even being cynical just with the state of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3908.695s">[Mustone]</a>: I'm being cynical with the Department of Ed of Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3954.278s">[Mustone]</a>: And then with the core five for the intervention,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3957.273s">[Mustone]</a>: Is that, would that bring on more staff, or you are saying the classroom teacher would be the interventionist using the core five?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3963.196s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3969.36s">[Mustone]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=3970.58s">[Mustone]</a>: OK, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6543.809s">[Mustone]</a>: My question was similar to Paul's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6545.89s">[Mustone]</a>: So we just take their word from their RFP that they pay their employees a living wage?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6551.946s">[Mustone]</a>: A fair living wage?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6553.086s">[Mustone]</a>: They don't say we pay our employees minimum wage?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6583.629s">[Mustone]</a>: Could they look at it again to make sure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6592.396s">[Mustone]</a>: So when future RFPs for cleaning, can we put in the language that they use for contractor RFPs that we make sure that there is a living wage included in the RFP?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6634.068s">[Mustone]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6634.368s">[Mustone]</a>: And I know you didn't ask, so you wouldn't have the answer, but moving forward,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6671.065s">[Mustone]</a>: Right, but it sounds like we didn't ask that question in the current RFP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6673.686s">[Mustone]</a>: So that's what I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6674.527s">[Mustone]</a>: Moving forward, can we put in the RFP that you provide whether it's a minimum wage or a living wage<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6681.724s">[Mustone]</a>: But I mean, on a daily basis, we hear about how the cost of living in the city of Medford, no one can afford it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6688.149s">[Mustone]</a>: So it seems like we should be doing our part to have people who are working in our schools be able to have a living wage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6694.934s">[Mustone]</a>: I'll get off my soapbox.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2302.944s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2303.304s">[Mustone]</a>: I was going to ask if Member Van der Kloot would amend her motion to send it to the policy subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2310.572s">[Mustone]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2310.992s">[Mustone]</a>: Could I make?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3080.814s">[Mustone]</a>: So I will not read the report and hope I can't do the highlights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3085.055s">[Mustone]</a>: Our agenda, five items that were discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3088.716s">[Mustone]</a>: The first was speed bumps at the high school complex.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3093.117s">[Mustone]</a>: I have emailed the chief of police and John Laughlin, our building manager, facilities manager, and they are looking into it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3102.84s">[Mustone]</a>: Second was the flashing speed signs that you see throughout the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3111.88s">[Mustone]</a>: telling us what speed we're going, if it is below the speed limit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3115.462s">[Mustone]</a>: Those are all being used throughout the city, but when one frees up, it will go to the high school complex.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3123.407s">[Mustone]</a>: The third was an update on the Andrew Glenn complex.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3126.869s">[Mustone]</a>: As of today, the sidewalks and curbing has been completed, and there's just some detailing work that needs to be finished.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3135.976s">[Mustone]</a>: Number four was regarding the school kitchen appliances, and that really stemmed from the desire to not use styrofoam plates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3146.905s">[Mustone]</a>: Rhetta Smith, the school nutritionist, did take an inventory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3150.348s">[Mustone]</a>: We do have many appliances throughout the school kitchens that need updating or repair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3158.355s">[Mustone]</a>: led us to a conversation with Alicia Hunt, who's the energy coordinator for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3162.297s">[Mustone]</a>: Kathy Kreatz and I will be meeting with her and some state officials to discuss possible grant applications to update our school kitchen appliances and other ways to be green in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3179.009s">[Mustone]</a>: The last item of our agenda was the Medford High School master plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3183.372s">[Mustone]</a>: And Mr. Brown, a teacher at the vocational high school,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3187.932s">[Mustone]</a>: gave us a report from his perspective as both a teacher and a citizen, and what is the plan for Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3197.38s">[Mustone]</a>: His questions really led us to discuss, is it about rehabbing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3204.646s">[Mustone]</a>: Is it about looking for funding to build new?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3208.349s">[Mustone]</a>: Is it about doing it in phases?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3212.552s">[Mustone]</a>: And Kathy Kreatz had<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3214.781s">[Mustone]</a>: suggested that we make a subcommittee that would almost be a master vision plan for the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3221.964s">[Mustone]</a>: So I would like to make a motion to create a subcommittee on a master vision for the high school repair and maintenance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3236.511s">[Mustone]</a>: And what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3240.173s">[Mustone]</a>: Vision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3240.813s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3720.712s">[Mustone]</a>: To clarify, I think it evolved from our typical subcommittee, our eight subcommittees, to now more of a committee like the superintendent search where community members are involved, teachers are involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3734.338s">[Mustone]</a>: It won't be three of the standing school committee members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3737.74s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3873.106s">[Mustone]</a>: Can I just ask out of the six of us who are interested in being on the Master Vision Plan Committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3877.887s">[Mustone]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3881.628s">[Mustone]</a>: So Paulette, Erin, Michael, and Kathy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3886.768s">[Mustone]</a>: They'll keep us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=415.431s">[Mustone]</a>: I'm not speaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=453.099s">[Mustone]</a>: Is there a motion to approve the minutes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=458.604s">[Mustone]</a>: Is there a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=612.648s">[Mustone]</a>: Member Di Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=613.489s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=613.85s">[Mustone]</a>: Member Kreatz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=614.45s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=614.751s">[Mustone]</a>: Member Mustone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=615.412s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=615.672s">[Mustone]</a>: Member Gero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=616.273s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=639.952s">[Mustone]</a>: And the mayor's going to do it when she comes back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1253.281s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes, I make a motion to accept the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1256.281s">[Mustone]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2454.712s">[Mustone]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2483.299s">[Mustone]</a>: Vanden Heuvel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2484.741s">[Mustone]</a>: Roll call vote please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2485.842s">[Mustone]</a>: Member DiBenedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2488.104s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2488.425s">[Mustone]</a>: Member Mustone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2489.005s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2489.185s">[Mustone]</a>: Member Ruggiero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2489.806s">[Mustone]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2490.226s">[Mustone]</a>: Member Ruseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3939.989s">[Mustone]</a>: I want to thank Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3940.989s">[Mustone]</a>: Patterson and the superintendent, because we have been talking about breakfast in the schools for three and a half years, and this is the first time that a compromise, it's not what our wish list is, but it's a beginning, and it can expand, and we can grow it, and the word is getting out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3955.721s">[Mustone]</a>: So I truly appreciate your compromise right here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3958.063s">[Mustone]</a>: So I vote also to approve this report of universal free breakfast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5916.843s">[Mustone]</a>: I have a point, just for clarification, if Dr. Cobb, so out of the nine screenings that you had said that you would recommend to us, out of the 90 screenings that are available, is this one of them, the Shaywitz?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5930.715s">[Mustone]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5931.195s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=5345.322s">[Mustone]</a>: I was like a mom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=5354.998s">[Mustone]</a>: I would say over the last two and a half years, the most, the highest concern I hear from parents is the maintenance and upkeep of the buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=5363.141s">[Mustone]</a>: And that we almost need to do an inventory of all our buildings and a plan for keeping up on top of the schools every year that we still call them new schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=5374.164s">[Mustone]</a>: This is really the new high school question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=5376.825s">[Mustone]</a>: So I think it would be great to have, you know, every year we do the same checklist that every building needs to stay on top of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=972.085s">[Mustone]</a>: So this is two parts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=973.366s">[Mustone]</a>: One is, what do you think is the primary function of a superintendent nowadays with so many shifting educational requirements?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=982.75s">[Mustone]</a>: And how would you implement your first steps for this priority if you were to be our superintendent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1077.511s">[Mustone]</a>: First steps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1078.212s">[Mustone]</a>: So if you were to be superintendent, what do you think your first steps would be in the new role?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3823.844s">[Mustone]</a>: So another big concern of parents that I received emails is about the upkeep<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3829.167s">[Mustone]</a>: and maintenance of our school buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3831.789s">[Mustone]</a>: So do you have experience with budget for upkeep and maintenance, or is that something that you see in your current BPS?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3841.636s">[Mustone]</a>: Is that something you've dealt with before with your schools that you are the superintendent of?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3915.634s">[Mustone]</a>: So is there a line budget item that says grounds?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4005.961s">[Mustone]</a>: And I know you've had many different roles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4008.202s">[Mustone]</a>: Have you had in one of your roles the responsibility to write a whole school budget and what was that like for you or how did it play out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4105.206s">[Mustone]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4105.786s">[Mustone]</a>: Well, I guess could I just follow up with that, just because you had mentioned community partners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4109.328s">[Mustone]</a>: Can you speak about partnerships that you've created or that you would like to see created in Medford that aren't currently here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7783.941s">[Mustone]</a>: Nice to see you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7784.881s">[Mustone]</a>: Very good to see you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7786.722s">[Mustone]</a>: So I guess my basic question is, what do you see as the primary role of the superintendent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7792.545s">[Mustone]</a>: And then following that, how would you take, what would your first steps be if you were to be the next Medford superintendent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7924.078s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=296.203s">[Mustone]</a>: I would say if you've googled Medford school system, you probably got a lot of articles about communication within the district with parents, with teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=306.11s">[Mustone]</a>: So if you could talk about how you communicate with teachers, administrators, parents, and everyone, and children, and the students, that would be, I would love to hear it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=315.917s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=483.77s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1878.223s">[Mustone]</a>: preschool education, except that it seems like a lot of front lines of newspapers is that four-year-olds should have a universal full-day program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1887.09s">[Mustone]</a>: So I know in Boston it's K1 and K2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1889.672s">[Mustone]</a>: I don't know about North Andover or if it's something you're interested in, if you think it's something we could do here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1894.856s">[Mustone]</a>: I know parents have asked me quite often about a four-year-old program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1899.019s">[Mustone]</a>: So your thoughts, early childhood?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2019.877s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2020.657s">[Mustone]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2021.738s">[Mustone]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2021.918s">[Mustone]</a>: Kritz?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2023.078s">[Mustone]</a>: Hi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4151.896s">[Mustone]</a>: I just have one more question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4153.316s">[Mustone]</a>: Another concern of many parents is the physical space in a capital plan for upkeep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4159.637s">[Mustone]</a>: So our elementary schools and our middle schools are still new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4164.038s">[Mustone]</a>: It's 13 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4166.959s">[Mustone]</a>: But have you worked with the capital plan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4168.599s">[Mustone]</a>: How do you address the building needs, the upkeep, the maintenance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4173.18s">[Mustone]</a>: That's something that comes up often.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4176.24s">[Mustone]</a>: with our buildings?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4310.879s">[Mustone]</a>: Were you part of the writing team for the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4314.081s">[Mustone]</a>: Middle school application.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4317.907s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6688.177s">[Mustone]</a>: Good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6689.042s">[Mustone]</a>: Turn this on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6690.783s">[Mustone]</a>: So I did learn through your resume that you have middle school and high school experience, but we do have four elementary schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6696.869s">[Mustone]</a>: So if you could talk some concerns you have, both your strengths with elementary are tying it in, or concerns of now heading a school system K through 12.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6821.171s">[Mustone]</a>: Can I follow up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6822.172s">[Mustone]</a>: Certainly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6824.033s">[Mustone]</a>: So about early childhood, a lot of surrounding towns are talking about a four-year-old full day, calling it K1, pre-K, K2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6833.421s">[Mustone]</a>: So I don't know if you have thoughts on that or if you see how that could work here in MedFed or if you've<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6839.983s">[Mustone]</a>: have a plan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6866.603s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6867.203s">[Mustone]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6868.744s">[Mustone]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6868.945s">[Mustone]</a>: Kritz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=8534.2s">[Mustone]</a>: You had used the phrase you're an outsider with an insider view.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=8540.308s">[Mustone]</a>: So with that inside view, what would you say is the Medford Public Schools greatest strength and greatest weakness and how would you address the weakness?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=8672.128s">[Mustone]</a>: Just to follow up on that, I know that we've exchanged emails that I had met with the two community directors for Medford and Somerville, and that I was unaware that any student can audit a class that would be high school credit, not Tufts credit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=8686.095s">[Mustone]</a>: And that the woman, Barbara Rugal, said she's had one most of the time, at most a year three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=8692.579s">[Mustone]</a>: And that is something that they are eager to get more partnership going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=8697.161s">[Mustone]</a>: So I'm not saying that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5111.453s">[Mustone]</a>: I just want to share with people at home that the Medford Community Coalition had emailed the school committee and other members in central administration about suggestions they had for communication and safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5129.086s">[Mustone]</a>: So I just want to clarify for them that one of their suggestions was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5134.478s">[Mustone]</a>: to find out if a training was happening with Alice, what's hopefully the timeline so we can say hopefully a professional development day in the near future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5143.68s">[Mustone]</a>: But this is just a short one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5145.38s">[Mustone]</a>: Yeah, an intro is March 21st and then further on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5148.801s">[Mustone]</a>: Their other suggestion was about the safety advisory committee that we had spoken about that is going to fall under the building and grounds subcommittee, which I chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5157.962s">[Mustone]</a>: And we did set a date, thank God, for Doodle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5161.195s">[Mustone]</a>: So our safety advisory committee first meeting will be Thursday night, March 22nd from 7 to 9 at the superintendent's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5169.902s">[Mustone]</a>: It will be posted tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5171.524s">[Mustone]</a>: Everyone is welcome to attend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5175.087s">[Mustone]</a>: And then their other suggestion was just having streamlined communication, which is something that is being addressed and working on with central administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5184.234s">[Mustone]</a>: So I want to thank the Method Community Coalition for giving us those great suggestions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5196.256s">[Mustone]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5196.656s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5241.789s">[Mustone]</a>: I can second it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5242.47s">[Mustone]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5528.55s">[Mustone]</a>: And I guess we'll find out more once we go through training.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5534.033s">[Mustone]</a>: But a friend of mine works in a different district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5536.923s">[Mustone]</a>: She was only trained once for ALICE.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5540.525s">[Mustone]</a>: So it's almost, I don't think you'd have to use a professional development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5543.987s">[Mustone]</a>: It would be for new hires, maybe during their new hire orientation, they would be trained for ALICE.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5549.21s">[Mustone]</a>: She was trained once three years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5550.611s">[Mustone]</a>: She's still a teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5551.531s">[Mustone]</a>: So I don't know if it's something that you have to be trained, it's the same training year after year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5557.114s">[Mustone]</a>: So that's something we can look into.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5558.475s">[Mustone]</a>: So it might not be, it could be part of that week of orientation for new teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5564.765s">[Mustone]</a>: Because I don't, but we'll have to clarify if you have to be retrained every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5626.386s">[Mustone]</a>: So the meeting when you were in Colorado, the chief supported it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5631.688s">[Mustone]</a>: A young man who was an EMT spoke about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5635.289s">[Mustone]</a>: And a mother of three children who professionally is an ALICE trainer spoke very eloquently about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5641.932s">[Mustone]</a>: So that's how it came.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5964.851s">[Mustone]</a>: Stone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5965.091s">[Mustone]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5965.791s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5966.452s">[Mustone]</a>: On the second to last page, just the last sentence, just as we think of pre-budgets, it says, while there are school adjustment Councilors at the elementary level, there may be the need for additional guidance Councilors at that level as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5979.48s">[Mustone]</a>: So is that recommending guidance Councilors for elementary schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5998.364s">[Mustone]</a>: So I know we at the Roberts have an adjustment Councilor that is great and works nonstop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6006.75s">[Mustone]</a>: So she does the social, emotional well-being part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6010.053s">[Mustone]</a>: Are you suggesting a guidance council for elementary for more academic part?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6014.217s">[Mustone]</a>: I'm just not sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6015.298s">[Mustone]</a>: Just to think of staffing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6053.384s">[Mustone]</a>: Does the high school have adjustment Councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6058.806s">[Mustone]</a>: And who does the adjustment Councilors, what department does it fall under?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6061.727s">[Mustone]</a>: Special education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6062.687s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6063.248s">[Mustone]</a>: So that's another budget that we'll hear about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6073.091s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7137.792s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7138.733s">[Mustone]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7138.873s">[Mustone]</a>: Mastone, thank you for your report, both of you for your report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7142.737s">[Mustone]</a>: The last paragraph on the report is, if we were to move either program to the Andrews, there are at least 10 teachers who will need the SEI endorsement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7154.063s">[Mustone]</a>: Organizations such as MatSol, Revis, Steam, I don't know any of them, will do training in the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7159.526s">[Mustone]</a>: The cost is between $8,800 and $12,000 for anywhere from 25 to 30 participants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7165.529s">[Mustone]</a>: So that's new to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7166.33s">[Mustone]</a>: I didn't know that there was a separate training.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7168.471s">[Mustone]</a>: And is it, how long is the training?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7174.488s">[Mustone]</a>: And so these companies, they'll all come to our city and would train the teachers who need this certification?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7217.994s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8425.591s">[Mustone]</a>: At the committee of the whole about the field trip, there was a number of parents from the CPAC organization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8433.316s">[Mustone]</a>: Did you reach out to them to ask them if this was... I don't... They spoke about the language they were looking for that made them feel confident that we were being equitable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8441.963s">[Mustone]</a>: So is that possible?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8443.003s">[Mustone]</a>: I think the chairperson said, could you reach out to me with language?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8446.146s">[Mustone]</a>: I could help you with language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14723.13s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14724.091s">[Mustone]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2201.159s">[Mustone]</a>: Stone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2202.3s">[Mustone]</a>: Thank you all for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2203.382s">[Mustone]</a>: I do appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2204.663s">[Mustone]</a>: And Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2205.083s">[Mustone]</a>: Haas, am I saying it right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2207.385s">[Mustone]</a>: So one thing that you said that really stood out for me was just looking for support, fundraising, and opportunities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2214.392s">[Mustone]</a>: So if there is steps that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2216.534s">[Mustone]</a>: we can move forward, like this is a great conversation, but it's just the beginning of really getting to what you need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2223.722s">[Mustone]</a>: If you want to, if we could start a regular dialogue, or if you have ideas that you need our support and fundraising and help, we would all be happy to do what you need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2236.335s">[Mustone]</a>: So thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2467.09s">[Mustone]</a>: Not just administration, we should be there too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3918.943s">[Mustone]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3920.124s">[Mustone]</a>: Then if a student, if someone comes looking for help from the student, who does the student then go to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3924.789s">[Mustone]</a>: Because that'd be a pretty heavy topic for a teenager.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3927.512s">[Mustone]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3942.062s">[Mustone]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3942.202s">[Mustone]</a>: But if a student says to the mentor, I'm in an unhealthy relationship, I don't know what to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3948.647s">[Mustone]</a>: Does the mentor deal with it or does the mentor say, go talk to Miss Perry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3958.646s">[Mustone]</a>: Was that last year where any students referred to you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3963.629s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay, well that's good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5921.029s">[Mustone]</a>: She got hit by a boat, carrying a boat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6042.446s">[Mustone]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6044.447s">[Mustone]</a>: If a parent forgets to write on the slip that my child had a concussion last spring, is there a second set of eyes that will tell the coach?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6076.321s">[Mustone]</a>: But I'm saying if the parent forgets to write down the high risk, the nurse will look at the last season of sports?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6393.518s">[Mustone]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6393.718s">[Mustone]</a>: Bustow?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6394.238s">[Mustone]</a>: Just on the idea of meetings, Joan, who was here earlier with the CPA, she just had mentioned when we were in the lobby, she was just saying it was unfortunate that Wednesday night is the CPA meeting,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6405.666s">[Mustone]</a>: And then it's also the Medford Community Coalition meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6408.649s">[Mustone]</a>: And she said, I almost wish there was a giant Google calendar for all city events.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6413.333s">[Mustone]</a>: And I don't know if that's something that this media center could put.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6416.836s">[Mustone]</a>: So there's one place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6418.117s">[Mustone]</a>: Because she said, it's a lot of the same people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6420.52s">[Mustone]</a>: She wouldn't have double booked it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6422.141s">[Mustone]</a>: But is that something this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6424.778s">[Mustone]</a>: Media center could do us community calendar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6452.262s">[Mustone]</a>: Well, the Robert's Ice Cream Social is 6.30, the Andrew's Curriculum Night is 6.30, so someone doesn't get ice cream at my house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6549.714s">[Mustone]</a>: I can't do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2237.811s">[Mustone]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2237.971s">[Mustone]</a>: Stone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6430.039s">[Mustone]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6431.2s">[Mustone]</a>: Just on the idea of meetings, Joan, who was here earlier with the CPA, she just had mentioned when we were in the lobby, she was just saying it was unfortunate that Wednesday night is the CPA meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6442.649s">[Mustone]</a>: And then it's also the Medford Community Coalition meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6445.63s">[Mustone]</a>: And she said, I almost wish there was a giant Google calendar for all city events.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6450.312s">[Mustone]</a>: And I don't know if that's something that this media center could put.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6453.793s">[Mustone]</a>: So there's one place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6455.074s">[Mustone]</a>: Because she said it's a lot of the same people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6457.475s">[Mustone]</a>: She wouldn't have double booked it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6459.156s">[Mustone]</a>: But is that something this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6461.755s">[Mustone]</a>: Media center could do us community calendar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6489.243s">[Mustone]</a>: Well, the Robert's Ice Cream Social is 6.30, the Andrew's Curriculum Night is 6.30, so someone doesn't get ice cream at my house.<br><br>
