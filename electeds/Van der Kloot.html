    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3175.817s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that good?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3177.697s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I live at 146 Pine Ridge Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3180.158s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Good evening, members of the City Council Governance Committee, Chair Tseng, fellow members of the Charter Review Committee, and Medford community members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3189.023s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: As you know, I served on the school committee for 32 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3192.724s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I asked to be appointed to the Charter Review Committee when I realized there was no one with school committee experience on the Charter Review Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3201.349s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: While some of my former school committee colleagues may not agree with what we have put forth in the draft,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3206.811s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: that you are reviewing tonight, rest assured that it has been put forth with deep reflection, not only my own, but with the very diligent subcommittee and the entire Charter Review Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3221.647s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: As someone who served with three different mayors, I strongly advocated for the mayor, whoever it might be, to remain as the school committee chair because the advantages are so strong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3234.334s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: As a school committee member, I had access to the mayor at every meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3240.178s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Not just me, every school committee member had the advantage of being able to discuss key educational issues in front of the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3251.883s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: being present at the school committee meetings ensures that the mayor is familiar with all the issues in detail and has buy-in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3261.848s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Our charter subcommittee interviewed all three mayors and each underscored how important it has been or is for them to fully comprehend school committee issues, our school issues, especially given the significant percentage of the budget which is spent on education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3281.699s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I remember the frustration of my colleagues across the aisle, that is you, the city council members, in former years when mayors did not come before them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3292.302s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You never heard that from school committee members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3295.203s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We worked closely with the mayors and they had buy-in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3299.804s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: To my former colleagues eager to do away with the role of the mayor as the chair of the school committee, I can only say be careful what you ask for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3308.311s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: School committee members play a very vital role in supporting all students and education, and that is enhanced when the mayor who recommends the budget is not distanced from the intricacy of the issues that become before the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3323.707s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Remember, the mayor only gets one vote, not more, not less, than any other member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=3333.733s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Later, I hope to perhaps address some of the other issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7316.231s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I wanted to address this issue of the autonomy of the school committee to pick their own officers or how that's done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7323.912s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I will tell you that this comes from my long years of experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7328.833s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And one of the things that I understand is that power is just so sweet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7335.275s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And if you would, I have seen that selection process happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7340.916s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I have seen very, very good people<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7343.491s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: who then decided they wanted to keep on being and locking out other members from getting an opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7351.716s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it's important that members of the body have an opportunity to be either, which now would be the chair and secretary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7368.087s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So if you would, that part of this comes from trying not to prevent fiefdoms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7373.428s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, in the original charter, when I went to look at it, there was practically nothing about the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7382.51s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And in this charter, there's not as much as I would like, quite honestly, because at the recommendation of the Collins Center, quite a bit was taken out that we had talked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7394.513s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: While I certainly understand the argument of having the body be autonomous and make their own decisions, I've also seen the negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7403.015s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And we have to look at both positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7406.356s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Now we're talking about chair and secretary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7410.157s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Now the secretary role includes signing the bills on behalf of the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7417.018s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That is the current structure that we use in Medford is the secretary of the school committee signs the bills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7424.6s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And once upon a time, I signed the bills for 10 years in a row.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7432.103s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It is a damn good thing that I'm honest, because nobody should have ever possibly wanted me to sign the bills for 10 years in a row.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7442.187s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And of course, I definitely invited my colleagues in and said, please take a look at what I'm doing, because I want to make sure that somebody else has eyes on this besides me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7452.11s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It is not always a popular position because it takes time, but there is also an added stipend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7459.593s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And there are added stipends for the position of what used to be vice chair and secretary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7468.036s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And in fact, I saw the recommendations that I think Councilor Bears put out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7474.118s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's significant money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7475.939s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it was like an $8,000 stipend for these positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7482.728s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I am wanting members to have the opportunity to do these different roles and not just keep it so that one person develops power and fiefdom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7495.846s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, if you read it, a key word is consecutive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7500.532s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I didn't say you can only do it once when we wrote this language and you don't get to do it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7505.855s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just said you can't do it consecutively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7508.897s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So you can do it in, you could be the chair in year one, year three, year five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7514.1s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You could be the secretary then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7516.442s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You could alternate those two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7518.303s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So it's far from perfect, but I think it's better than not saying anything at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7525.007s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So that is the thinking behind it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7526.97s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That is the rationale as we spoke on the committee of saying, look, do we put this in now personally, and maybe it's my mistake because I didn't catch it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7536.362s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But I didn't think about it, I have experience as a school committee member, not as a city Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7541.228s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Because quite honestly, I think you guys ought to rotate your chair, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7544.972s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't like the idea of having one person be the chair every single year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7548.496s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd much rather see it rotate around members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7552.08s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And that isn't to say that I don't want to see Council Bears not be the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7559.208s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7559.929s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm happy if he's chair one, three and five or whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7563.071s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You get my point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7564.192s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just don't think that one person in our city government should have a lock on these positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7570.458s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it's important to let other members have a chance to get the experience of leading and being in that role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7579.785s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That's where it comes from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7601.607s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, I need to take a look because it was originally that's what our discussion was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7607.091s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The intent of being is that it would just, you know, because every two years you've got different people on the committee anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7615.038s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So there's change, you know, so, but the idea was that not one person wouldn't have a lock on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7622.323s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'll take a look.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7658.871s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Well then don't put anything in the jar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7660.672s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, you know, that's always a possibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7664.094s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, you know, the, I don't, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7670.305s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: how else to go about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7672.426s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I understand people don't necessarily agree with me, but some of those people may be the same people who have a lock on positions now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7680.228s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I don't know if that's true or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7681.349s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't want that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7683.15s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But I'm just saying that for me, I am looking at not creating fiefdoms of power.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7689.892s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm looking at ways of giving other members opportunities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7694.654s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's pretty simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=7696.014s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: To me, it's common sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2355.723s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2801.343s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4637.583s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10096.433s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Councilor Tseng, did you want me to go ahead to address that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10107.899s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I think we certainly considered all the different options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10112.783s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We were concerned that not everybody, you know, if we looked over historically at where school committee members, what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10123.992s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: uh wards they had lived in and we we were concerned in and and the way that our particular uh city there um we don't have a school in each ward so we were looking at school placements and how that worked and it it doesn't really correspond in any way and we were concerned i mean um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10146.377s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Sometimes there aren't that many people interested in running for school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10151.265s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's a very taxing job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10154.049s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It takes a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10156.502s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: In the past, the stipends were always considerably lower.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10160.364s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We don't want someone running for position just because they want to collect the stipend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10166.246s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so after we discussed all of the different options, and then we started trying to say, well, if we were doing ward representation, what would happen if we had wards where no one wanted to be on the school committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10180.931s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And we were concerned about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10184.535s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, after many different looking at this, this to us seemed to be an opportunity to certainly increase representation from different districts in the city, but also minimize other potential problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10681.716s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=13173.419s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There we go, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=13175.68s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Councilor Tseng, I just wanted to come back for just a second to say I became a little nervous as I was listening to the discussion that all of a sudden the comparison was to what the school committee subcommittee proposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=13188.152s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: in our particular part of the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=13191.754s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And it is different than what was proposed for city Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=13197.696s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That was because we did see that there was different roles and really in some ways different populations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=13208.513s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I wanted to say that I came slowly toward representation, but ultimately voted and supported it because as a member of the committee, and having attended many of the information sessions,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=13224.743s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: and listening to people and talking to people in other communities, as well as having the discussions that we'll talk more about in terms specifically about the school committee, I heard from our citizens a great interest in having ward representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=13243.578s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think, and as I served on the committee, you know, you could go nuts doing this because there's always one more thing you can do and one more thing and make it better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=13255.062s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I absolutely believe that we're really all interested here in trying to come up with a good, positive solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=13265.005s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And we all understand that it's really time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=13269.226s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So there's, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=13271.637s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: the weighing between how much do we go back to the drawing board and do another something and another something and how much we move is, you know, the question is there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=13284.067s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to let the committee know that I came to appreciate ward representation, even though as someone who had ran and served our city for a long time, I loved representing the whole city, but there was much to be said for those other discussions and I don't want<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=13300.581s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: the fact that we chose something different to put forward to you for the school committee to hamper the discussion or make anybody think that I was not a proponent for what the committee put forth overall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=13316.289s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=5903.246s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Come on, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=5904.607s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Come on, come on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=7998.119s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Hi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=7998.72s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's great to see everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=7999.84s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8001.04s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Good to see you, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8001.881s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8002.261s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I have to look around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8004.822s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm here today representing the Medford Educational Foundation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8009.223s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm the president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8010.344s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And this is David Sayers, my grants manager who manages all the grants that come in and organizes them for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8020.787s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We're also joined, I'm just going to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8023.428s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Our treasurer, who wasn't able to be here, but Steve Hayes, Gail Arslanian member, Chris DeVita, also Diane Caldwell, a name you'll all know, is part of our merry little group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8039.827s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think I got them all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8041.99s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Did I get them all?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8042.73s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I got them all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8043.989s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Anyway, what we've been very quietly doing for the last eight, maybe nine years is giving away money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8051.672s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And of course it always amuses me that we have to come and ask you to accept it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8055.734s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This amused me when I was sitting over there, because I would think you'd be so happy to take it you would just.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8060.976s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: grab it from my hands and no need for formal approval but I'm here to give you $8,755 tonight to go towards the grants that teachers applied for so they we have a process where they write us their good ideas and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8077.722s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We weigh and deliberate over them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8080.664s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Very often, we can't fund all of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8083.085s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We received more than $26,000 in requests, just to give you some idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8087.848s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So roughly, right now, we're funding about a third of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8092.091s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But last year, all together, we gave you over $16,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8093.932s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And we're about on track for that this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8099.175s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And the type of grants that we love to fund is, for your like example, the middle school librarians joined forces and asked us to fund a community read.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8109.899s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And we think that's a wonderful project to bring the middle school students together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8115.241s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The Mississippi has asked us to fund, which we're partially funding, an author's visit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8120.202s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: They haven't had one for a very long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8122.623s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: At the vocational school, they asked us for a brand new upgraded 3D printer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8128.725s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: and a much more expensive one than they've had, and we funded that at your last meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8135.507s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You okayed a field trip experience for the United Nations Club, and we're giving them $1,000 towards that trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8145.129s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We have an after-school cooking club at the Andrews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8149.05s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We think it's a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8151.05s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: working on international food.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8153.671s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so we're funding some of their expenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8157.031s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's the thing we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8158.512s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: They're not earth shattering, but they sure are fun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8161.172s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And we think that they add to a student's enjoyment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8165.293s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And we know from the feedback that we get that the teachers really present, appreciate having another funding source that they can ask to for money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8175.435s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the funds we just gave out was for 50 bucks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8179.116s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And a teacher said, boy, really appreciate that very small amount of money, but that's something we can do and something which, frankly, I know that doesn't always happen on your end because it's a different thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8191.428s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So anyway, we are very, very grateful to the people who support us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8196.213s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Needham Bank has been a great supporter of us, giving us over $5,000 for the last couple of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8201.498s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The Medford Community Fund has also contributed to us for several years running after we've written for grants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8208.903s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And we're really an intermediary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8210.804s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We collect money and we give it away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8212.565s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: As soon as we get money, we give it away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8214.706s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And for that purpose, I'm going to let you know that the Kiwanis of Medford generously just let us know that we'll be receiving a check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8223.872s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: and at your next meeting in two weeks time I won't come again but I will ask you there will be an additional there were a couple grants we couldn't fund that we really wanted to so you'll see us come up again just for your approval and we thank the Kiwanis and Needham Bank and Mr. Gene Kalaw from Needham Bank for their incredible support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8245.703s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Anyway,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8247.631s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that about covers it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8251.493s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's great to see you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8252.453s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I have to always note that two of you used to be my students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8257.835s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: John and Aaron both volunteered at Winchester Hospital when I was there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8262.677s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So it does amuse me that you both ended up on the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8267.419s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So anyway, who's gonna take the check and make sure it gets to the right place?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8273.401s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8277.438s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And again, I'd really like to thank the very dedicated crew.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8279.899s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We're small, but we've been absolutely consistent for years working together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8285.16s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And David's done a phenomenal job, and Steve Hayes, everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=8289.04s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2595.816s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Oop, there we go, 146 Pine Ridge Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2599.877s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I've not been on this side of the rail too often.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2602.797s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But this all seems vaguely familiar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2606.038s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So before I go on with the MEF, I first wanna assure you that there is life after school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2612.279s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And this is the very first school committee meeting that I've attended after two years, because I've been so busy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2619.84s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But it's a pleasure to see both the mayor, the superintendent,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2625.641s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: once fellow school committee members and school committee elect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2628.942s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Congratulations to you, by the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2631.442s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, I did serve with two of you for six years, and Sharon, I didn't get to serve with you, but it was a great comfort when I left knowing that you were going to take the seat because I knew you had diligently prepared by coming to so many school committee meetings that you knew your stuff and you could step right in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2651.626s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So while I didn't get to serve with you, I'm certainly grateful to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2655.933s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: To Kathy, Kathy, oh my God, so much time spent together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2659.558s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And, you know, a couple of words kept on coming up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2663.603s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: One, diligent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2665.618s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh my God, Kathy was the most careful about preparing for every meeting, making sure she had read and understood everything and had thought thoroughly through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2676.162s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Just amazing dedication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2678.462s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And of course, one of the things that really stands out to me is being able to meet your husband and of course your incredible son Noah, who became a friend and who we enjoyed seeing all the time and who I still see his<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2691.926s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: posts and whatever, and he's, of course, continuing doing wonderful volunteer work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2696.128s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So hello to Noah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2698.15s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm sure the time now has come where you'll really get to relax and you worked so hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2704.293s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You really deserve it, Kathy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2705.754s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2708.155s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And to Mia, when I thought about you, there's one word that stands out for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2715.499s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Not blunt, but moral.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2720.911s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I remember in those first two years when we serve together, which there was some really difficult times, because, yeah, there were some difficult times in the other, you know, pandemic and everything, but there were some really difficult times, and you led.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2735.276s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: with a deep moral sense that I just really think was wonderful, because there was a lot of pressure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2745.106s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I so appreciated that from you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2748.289s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And of course, with you, it's been a delight to meet all your family members, your husband Tim, to watch the kids grow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2754.995s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's one of the things that as we, you know, sometimes forget there's a real, when we're working together every week and over the years, you get to know everybody's family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2764.36s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So anyway, congratulations to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2766.601s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I know this has been a long time coming and I know you're going to enjoy it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2770.743s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And just in case you get bored now, you and I have already talked about it, but Kathy, you know, and Sharon, the Medford Educational Foundation is looking for more members and,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2782.248s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'd like right now to invite you to join us because we have this fantastic little group of dedicated people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2789.354s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Some of them are not here tonight, some of them I'll introduce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2792.357s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But we've been working sort of behind the scenes for roughly seven years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2796.661s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I actually have to go back and figure it out sometime.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2800.905s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The Medford Educational Foundation was started<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2804.835s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: way long ago, maybe 20 plus 25 years, by the late, great Bob Gilligan, attorney Bob Gilligan, and Gene Bralt, or Len Bralt, excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2818.442s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It lasted for a couple of years, and then it kind of went by the wayside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2823.905s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Ann Kasuth and I resurrected it about seven or eight years ago, and we've been working behind the scenes ever since that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2835.765s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Today, tonight, on behalf of the Medford Educational Foundation, I am writing you to formally ask you to accept a donation to the Medford Public Schools to cover the specific grants that we are able to fund at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2851.755s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Each year, we have two times during the year where we accept applications from teachers, and we ask them either to apply for a grant of zero to $200<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2865.385s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: or another grant from $200 to $2,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2869.231s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And we accept those grants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2872.055s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And then as a body, we deliberate on the grants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2876.222s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We check out with the schools that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2879.136s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The projects are consistent with the educational values and direction that the school system must go in or is going in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2888.16s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And Diane Caldwell, who of course you guys all know, has been extremely helpful in being a partner with us and volunteering her time so that we could make these grants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2902.441s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This December, we received over 38 requests from teachers who outlined specific projects or requests that they believe would enhance their students' learning experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2917.219s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: While we would have loved to fund each and every one of them, we met as a group and decided which grants we could fund in their entirety, which grants we could partially fund, and sadly, which grants we couldn't afford at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2931.087s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The December application cycle yielded more than $24,000 in requests, and we have been able to fund $13,058.86.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2947.307s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So tonight, we're asking you to approve our donation, and I do want to mention that we've done this before but we haven't been asked to present it to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2956.137s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But we also gave over $10,000 in the spring for example too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2961.483s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: However, we would not be able to do the work we do with the support of our donors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2967.409s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: we want to acknowledge the generosity of Needham Bank, and especially Vice President and Branch Manager, Jean Kalau, who presented us with a total donation of over $10,000 this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2980.275s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And... This is Jean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2981.256s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Jean, stand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2985.218s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Jean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=2995.492s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This connection between us and Jean was because of Mia.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3001.219s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so we are extremely appreciative for that because it sure has helped this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3006.586s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: As you can see, our requests are steadily increasing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3010.29s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And in fact, it's, you know, we need more money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3012.653s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We need more money, Jean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3016.212s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So, and let's see, I wrote, the Medford Education Foundation has kept a low profile, but has been receiving, reviewing, and funding grants to teachers over the last seven years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3030.543s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This coming year, we hope to share our good news more widely as we anticipate the need to raise more funds for the many requests we find ourselves receiving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3040.53s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That is code for don't be surprised if you get a letter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3045.812s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Anyway, I'd just like to take a second to acknowledge the rest of the members I have with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3053.875s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: David Sayers, David<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3056.138s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: coordinates all the grants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3057.919s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: In the second row, Stephen Hayes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3060.101s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Stephen Hayes makes sure that all the money is aligned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3063.484s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And by the way, we have been working with Gerry McCue and Noel Velez right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3070.889s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I wish I had one of those big checks, but we know better to waste money on this, on necessities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3078.135s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So here's the check and they're not here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3080.757s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I guess superintendent, I'm going to give it to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3086.012s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Do we have a motion for approval?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3097.676s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So now I can officially hand it over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3101.778s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Steve should really be up here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3114.335s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So our treasurer, Steve, is very diligent and tracking all of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3120.701s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And, you know, we hope after we closed our time period for receiving the grants, we received several more on top of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3130.871s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And the other place where we've had donations, apart from private donations, which we also<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3136.013s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: solicit and accept happily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3138.974s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The Medford Community Fund has also been generous to us, and I want to acknowledge that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3144.196s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So again, it's great to see you all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PZnGMmPL0QE&t=3146.157s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Have a great night, and thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3117.538s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19657.488s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Jones here, 40 Cedar Road North.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19659.369s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I believe Ryan Hayward should be on the Zoom call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19664.613s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Eastie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=262.44s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I've never been here before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=425.68s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I have to tell you, I'm not here to receive a plaque tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=428.922s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: In fact, what I'm here is to commend my fellow elected officials who are leaving their posts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=436.094s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: very shortly, Michael Marks and John Falco.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=439.436s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I've had the opportunity over the years to work with many fine individuals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=444.479s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And you know, sometimes we agreed and sometimes we didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=447.52s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But we always had found some place to have common ground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=451.042s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think that's so important in today's world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=454.304s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'd like to thank you, Michael, for the years that I served with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=457.766s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You were such a kid then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=460.617s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=461.778s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And john, it was such a pleasure to serve with you for the years to watch you both go on to the city council, and we're going to miss you very very much so thank you so much, and my.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=473.866s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The one thing that I think every elected official, whether we agree or disagree, there is a common bond between us, because of the years we've learned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=483.832s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: to go out to campaign every two years and to put your families through that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=489.153s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And you both have such wonderful, wonderful families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=492.734s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And it was really pleasure of mine to watch, to know when they were born and to watch them grow, to graduate from high school, to go on to college.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=502.935s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's really been a pleasure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=504.516s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you both.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=505.876s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And George, thank you for your kind words.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=508.136s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=509.236s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=510.096s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I appreciate my fellow Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=701.444s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: No, give a hoot was so popular, he tried to take it over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=731.852s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=732.272s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=734.114s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the problems with masks is nobody can see me smile, and I just want you to know I'm printing ear to ear, so thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5987.952s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, okay, we're back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=4771.292s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I just want to bring to the attention just in case somebody wants to let somebody know who's not here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=4778.619s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There's a problem with the audio.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=4780.2s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Comcast is having a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=4782.062s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, we're working with that through Medford Community Media.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=4784.684s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=4784.844s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: John's on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=4785.685s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And it says that if people want to go, if anybody wants to text friends, they can go to the Medford's YouTube channel to be able to watch the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5101.134s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Motion to suspend the rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7091.486s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, just in response to my colleague, I will tell you that I know that over the years that there's been any number of times where parents have chosen to withdraw their child before an expulsion because they didn't want an expulsion on the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7107.494s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so it's a very interesting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7109.91s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: area, but that could account for some of the differences that have happened in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7116.758s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I did want to thank the students who spoke out clearly tonight, and to all of the students who've been articulate during this period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7126.869s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I will tell you that as the events unfolded, I did go and have conversations with key people just to make sure I felt comfortable that I knew that our staff was handling it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7141.438s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I even drove by from a distance when there was a walkout on Friday, observing then the superintendent, Dr. Cushing, and many of our other administrators talking to the groups of students engaged in conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7156.787s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: and getting the sort of feedback which will only be more helpful to us as we go on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7161.45s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I appreciate your work, and I appreciate the students coming forth and being active, because that's what it's ultimately going to take for us to improve the current climate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7173.617s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's been a difficult time for everybody and we are not unique.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7180.427s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: the sort of issues that we're facing in Medford right now are being faced across the country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7185.908s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And while that in no means makes it okay, I think it's an interesting thing to understand the dynamics of society right now and how they're affecting our kids and why it's so important that we listen to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7306.938s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We did not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7309.9s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Just prior to my leaving for the meeting, I checked and the only letter I had was from our student, Catherine, which you've all heard now and I sent to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9673.628s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9674.649s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Just real quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9675.991s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So are students being assessed for the family report four times a year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9681.037s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9681.564s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Three times a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9682.585s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Three, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9685.007s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is the idea that it might, for those students who haven't achieved fluency, would it ultimately go up to maybe through the third grade or is it, you know, will it grow?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9758.697s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=9761.998s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Sounds good, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10965.517s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, just because I think it's appropriate to ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10968.957s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So let's take the $50,000 figure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10972.778s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Given our expenditures to date, is it realistic to that we will be able to cover that expense given our budget expenses so far this year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10986.431s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I guess I'm asking Mr. Murphy that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11052.462s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11053.002s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I guess my question is, are our expenses running as expected, or are they widely more than we expected?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11062.528s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And should we be concerned about spending a significant amount of money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11066.89s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, again, part of the problem is it may not be significant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11069.452s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Maybe it's $10,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11069.832s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Maybe it's $12,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11155.881s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11156.222s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That's exactly what I was hoping you'd say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4576.006s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4577.367s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think this sounds like very interesting and challenging work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4582.189s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: A couple of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4584.009s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: First, where were the engagement specialists housed in the schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4588.771s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Have we found offices for them all?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4591.432s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Because I can't believe that wasn't a challenge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4636.96s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That was actually my second question was, you know, part of this is, is that they have to find their place within the schools, right, and to a point that Mr. Murphy made earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4647.065s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Sometimes they've had to be utilized as coverage, but frankly, that sometimes is the time when you really get to see a broad view of students, and this can be very very valuable to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4659.513s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: whoever works in the school so I actually think, especially at the beginning of the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4663.076s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That's an asset, even, you know, I understand it's time consuming, but it does allow someone to come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4671.184s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, my other question is so let's suppose said person, one of your reengagement specialist is something that we as adults understand the terminology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4681.953s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: What will the kids call these individuals?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4684.314s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Where do they fit in there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4753.285s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess, you know, I'm just thinking for the youngest kids, something like a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4757.287s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: helping hand or something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4759.009s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, you know something, something that something, even a helper I'm a helper that someplace I can just see them being in the school and trying to say, how do they define their place with the title, which is child friendly helper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=4777.324s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Anyway, just curious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5573.263s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Just to clarify, so the students were moved, or was this an event where the teacher came in and found the water in the?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5583.485s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: After the evening or weekend?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5591.087s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And the students were moved?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5599.731s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And then are the ceiling tile has been replaced at this point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5606.14s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Are the kids back in that original classroom?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5608.141s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, they're definitely back in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5624.014s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5624.495s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And this was one classroom at the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5627.757s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5630.686s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5631.126s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5631.526s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Three kindergarten classrooms were affected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5636.708s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5637.708s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So one of the things which I'm just going to comment on is that I feel almost like our rules and regulations about how we address something, I think we're unfortunate in this case because we had a member of the public come up<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5658.595s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: and show some photos, and it says we're not supposed to respond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5664.641s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And yet it was very clear to me that the superintendent had been down, that she knew a lot about this, that you knew a lot about this, but because it says we're not supposed to respond, that family who was sitting here<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5681.242s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: walked away without any answers, just, and we did what we could do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5685.686s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We said we referred it and asked you for information today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5689.269s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: To me, there's a process thing, which is difficult for me, only because if we're following our rules, then we're not responding to a person with an immediate concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5700.768s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think it doesn't speak to the strength of the administrative team who knew everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5708.455s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You could have answered the questions last week with a follow-up today or whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5716.061s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But I find that to be, as someone who's been on the committee for a long time, a very difficult place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5720.585s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I understand we're following procedure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5723.688s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: To the end, the only thing I could think of, frankly,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5728.917s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: to the superintendent is to say, please be more proactive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5733.439s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This was a situation you knew about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5735.16s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It probably should have been in your report, so we could have spoken about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5739.623s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So if something like that's the thing, the only thing my sort of plea to you is to be, I think you guys did everything right, that you were on top of the situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5750.228s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But unfortunately, when it was presented, because we were following our rules,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5756.255s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: it didn't look like you were as on top of the situation as you actually were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5804.365s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It doesn't, and it never will, because when things happen like that, it's going to be a problem for all of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5810.29s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But on the other hand, since we did know it was going to be on the agenda, if it had been included<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5817.764s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: In the superintendent's remarks, we could have said, we're going to hold that until later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5823.79s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, frankly, I'm trying to do a workaround around our rule, which makes sense for other reasons, but is sometimes challenging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5833.38s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm not going to be here to do it, but I am saying to my committee members, this is an interesting dilemma.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5861.314s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Because I guarantee you that when there's something like this particular problem, it's going to get to the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5866.718s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, it's going to get, you know, it's not a surprise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5869.981s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5871.242s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so, and it also leads us to just ask the question right now, is there, are we experiencing, there's always leaks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5879.989s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Are we experiencing anything else that you've got your eye on, that you're concerned about in another?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5909.124s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: In terms of, this seems like possibly this is a roofing issue, is that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5916.75s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Say it again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5921.689s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is this a roofing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5972.891s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Specifically, this isn't something which is going to be solved by putting on a new roof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5976.914s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is this saying we need a new roof?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5995.783s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=5995.943s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6309.662s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I just want to go back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6311.002s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: In fact, as I recall, as my brain fog lifts, Mia's absolutely right, my colleague, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6317.605s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mastones, because I do, in fact, remember that we fixed this problem before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6325.928s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And that, you know, that's part of the problem is that we fix problems, and they happen again, and they happen again and with all good intentions that people thought that they got to the root of it the last time we had put together, if we, if we go back at least two, four years when we were doing the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6348.963s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: planning over what would infrastructure planning over the next couple of years, what project we would see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6355.529s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: At that time, the roofs were on that saying well they probably have a shelf life of another five years or so well that's back for at least four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6365.038s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: years, if I recall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6366.139s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think that document is one that should surface again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6369.701s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It does exist and that those were items of concern back then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6375.984s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And again, it's difficult because they're big ticket items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6380.667s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6381.327s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Ruseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6477.339s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If I could go just one little part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6478.88s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's not if a resident has an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6482.241s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's asking the administration that if something like this occurs again, where children are moved out of the classroom because of a major issue like this, that you included in the report of the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6498.545s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Because I think that's the easiest way to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6501.86s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: to have it on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hr7vlJwC1Vw&t=6732.738s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just would like to ask the administration as to whether a timetable like this is doable, realistic, and what, if not, what would be realistic given the obvious desire of the committee to move the budget discussions up earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=499.807s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You can dial in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=501.248s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Dialing number is 1301-715-8592.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=504.209s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member McLaughlin, could you please take the roll call?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=530.414s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=531.295s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So we have six members present and one absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=534.939s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The mayor is absent this evening and she asked me to chair the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=539.784s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Could you please rise for the salute to the flag?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=544.61s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I pledge allegiance to the flag.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=559.677s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=560.838s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The first item before us is the consent agenda, the approval of bills and payrolls, and the regular school committee meeting minutes of October 18, 2021.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=572.403s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=576.104s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So on the motion of Member Graham and seconded by Member McLaughlin, all in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=590.283s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This is the Special Education and Behavioral Health Subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=594.245s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The report will be given by Member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=597.266s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We do understand that this was a difficult meeting and that other members could not attend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=602.168s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But Melanie, if you could give us a synopsis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=605.969s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Sure, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=657.681s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I would, yeah, so someone let me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=673.837s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, could I ever anything?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=683.303s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Public comment on the motion, uh, by member Rousseau to suspend the rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=689.466s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Do I hear second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=791.927s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=793.808s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you for letting us know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=796.55s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to, we do have another presentation tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=803.226s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: by Mr. Chris Richard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=806.568s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Usually those don't take place though till seven o'clock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=809.39s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That was unusual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=810.611s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So can we, are you comfortable with, okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=814.053s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much, Mr. Richard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=816.615s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So to a motion to resort back to the regular order of business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=823.189s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, member motion by member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=825.47s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We're so seconded by member McLaughlin will return to the regular order all in favor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=830.272s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I will return to the regular order of business report of the superintendent number one public health update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=848.802s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=849.642s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: A report of the superintendent's remarks come first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=853.064s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=1483.569s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=1485.49s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Superintendent, could I ask that in the future when we do our agenda, that report of the superintendent, always that the first item be labeled comments from the superintendent or report, just so that it's clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=1498.859s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I do want to take a minute to say I appreciate the fact that you were one of the panel speakers at our MASC conference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=1509.086s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I was able to listen in virtually,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=1511.488s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I must say, it made me feel very proud that we were so well represented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=1515.97s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you for being there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=1518.251s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'd like to thank member Rousseau and member Graham for being there and being part of the resolutions committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=1544.947s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Hines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=1953.168s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you have a question, Member McLaughlin?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=1954.888s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=1955.689s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=2221.773s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=2223.805s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Ruscio.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=2476.207s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=2476.387s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=3163.469s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=3165.79s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, thank you very much, Mr. Murphy and Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=3168.111s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Hines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=3173.835s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I was going to ask Mr. Richards whether you'd like to come up and give your presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=3178.597s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: May I ask for a suspension motion, please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=3182.88s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And may I have a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=3184.18s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=3185.441s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: All in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=3186.001s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=3187.803s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: All opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=3189.04s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=3190.201s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Before you start, Mr. Richard, I need to read this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=3194.183s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Presentations of the public, not to begin before 7 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=3198.165s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Regular meetings of the school committee include this presentation of the public agenda item to give any resident the opportunity to place a presentation before the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=3207.05s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: A resident may only present once at any meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=3209.992s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: These presentations are an opportunity for the public to make a presentation to the committee, but are not opportunities for a dialogue with the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=3217.916s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If one or more members of the committee wishes to have a conversation about the topic presented, a member may request that the item be added to a subsequent regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=3226.385s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The details for submitting a presentation can be found within the policy BEDH public comments and presentations of the public, which Mr. Richard you clearly did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=3236.095s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So, could you please introduce yourself?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=3239.537s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Could you please introduce yourself?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=3245.082s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And your address, Mr. Richard?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=3524.786s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=3525.326s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=3525.766s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Richard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=3527.307s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Given the concerns expressed by this parent, I'm going to ask that our administration follow up with a report back to the school committee at our next regular meeting, which is next Monday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=3539.329s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I realize it's very short timetable, but clearly this is significant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=3549.471s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I can't make a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=3550.251s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just know I know I'm what you want to make a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=3557.719s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=3560.201s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So motion by Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=3562.043s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: McLaughlin with the resounding second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4255.453s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: How would you like to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4644.008s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Member Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=4645.908s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Was there anybody else who wanted to comment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=5019.263s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So what I'm hearing is that the committee strongly supports the direction that the superintendent has laid out for us and that with the constructive feedback that was given tonight, we'd like you to bring it back to us with some refinements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=5036.189s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that so?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=5039.53s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Motion to lay on the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=5042.251s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=5777.823s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Before I go on, I just asked, neither the superintendent nor I received copies of the pictures that Mr. Richard, if one of you could let us have those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=5789.496s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6286.798s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Are you amenable?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6530.598s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Ruseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6535.98s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We voted to apply for this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6554.7s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we all certainly appreciated that we were going to get an opportunity to only promise it as I read this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6561.947s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There are one or two things that, you know, I read one, the district is putting out tons of communication, too dense, not too way, need to find balance and simplicity, coordinating communication, different methods, platforms can be difficult for administrators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6576.554s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is anybody remember that we were in the middle of a pandemic and that we were sending out tons of information because there needed to be tons of information sent out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6584.618s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, so there's a couple of these comments that I would, I would step back from and say, let's think about the timing and what are our expectations, and what was the need at the time that need at the time was to get a lot of information out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6597.427s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It was very dense, it was difficult it was so if you think about the number of meetings that we all went to in March alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6604.853s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: with, which was just overwhelming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6608.735s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: As one member could say, I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6611.897s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So, the, we, you know, I think that there was very many positive things about this, I actually think that member grams.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6622.024s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: request to send it to the subcommittee so that the two now become working together makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6627.426s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But most importantly, Member McLaughlin, if you were willing to check out the date and let us know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6633.228s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Luckily, our next school committee meeting is only just next week, and then we could understand what our date is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6639.65s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So would that be amenable to you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6646.833s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Motion to table till next week, seconded by, sorry, Member Ruseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6709.46s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I heard a motion to lay on the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/koyFP0ugilA&t=6821.348s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, and it- Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2421.39s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Excuse me, I have two letters from the public that need to be included at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2429.5s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Sorry, guys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2430.722s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The first one is from a citizen Justine Deutsch Myers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2437.434s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2438.981s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: that she lives at 197 Playstead Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2442.162s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: What, if anything can be done, this is just what we were talking about, within the schools to increase the COVID vaccination rates in the 12 to 15 year old student group and then 16 to 19 year old students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2453.407s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: According to the map published by CBS Boston last week, Medford's vaccination rate of 12 to 15 year olds is just 57%, and the rate for 16 to 19 year olds is 60%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2467.972s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Have there been vaccination clinics in the middle schools and MHS for students and or other initiatives to improve on these rates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2475.935s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Have you been collaborating or discussing strategies with other cities and towns nearby that have higher rates of vaccination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2484.778s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Our numbers are lower than neighboring cities and towns in our local region for, for example,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2490.208s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: 12 to 15 year olds Arlington has 90% Somerville is 83% Malden has 60% Melrose 76% and Medford is down at 57% 1619 year olds again similar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2504.713s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: where Medford trails significantly behind the other towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2508.694s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So again, if you could specifically ask, have we done vaccination clinics and are there any more scheduled?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2516.937s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Are they effective?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2518.057s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Would be my question to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2520.898s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Have you reached out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2521.818s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Are there anything else we can learn from other cities who are doing better than we are?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2527.28s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I would add just is, do incentives help at all?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2531.901s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2534.743s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you do the, you know, win a gift card or whatever, just that help at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2666.031s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: OK, the next letter comes also from the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2695.026s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, that would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2697.036s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I do think for parents it's convenient if it's right at the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2699.937s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So, so the second letter is from citizen Christina McCordy, and she's a 24 North Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2708.32s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's multiple questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2717.003s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yep, air quality checks in the school buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2719.964s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And she said that we were told that air filters would be replaced often.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2726.185s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Can we have an update on this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2727.945s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If the filters are not replaced often, she says the air quality cannot be guaranteed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2755.398s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She's specifically asking about air filters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2841.783s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So would they just, I'm asking you, would they be changed around, say, December 1st again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2850.925s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Quarterly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2851.305s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Maybe you could just give us an update when that happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2884.736s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, second question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2886.638s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: School staff have ongoing concerns regarding the room temperature in classrooms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2891.661s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Warm classrooms, she says, lead to more improper mask wearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2895.365s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Also, when you cannot feel the AC, it is hard to know if the air is blowing, which leads to worries about airflow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2902.131s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Work requests have been repeatedly ignored, she says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=2905.394s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So please detail what staff need to do to get these concerns addressed, and please make sure it is communicated to all staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3028.3s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, number three, many teachers or staff at our school are interested in additional your air purification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3035.862s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The PTO at our school would like to purchase box fans with more 13 filters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3041.544s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: They are under $100 each but most of our classroom teachers are interested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3045.826s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Can we request the use of code would bend to put toward this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3050.267s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: For equity sake, we would like this offer to all school buildings, our PTO will also put some funds toward this is their formal process to request coded funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3161.11s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: With the air testing that we're having done now, if there was such an area, would it automatically be put in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3172.774s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3177.495s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Fourth and lastly, can we have an update on staffing issues?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3180.476s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Are we close to returning to testing twice per week?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3236.179s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, I received one more letter, just just as it came in as you were speaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3241.187s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It says, this is from Ingrid Mercado 131 budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3247.066s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Hello, I'd like to comment about the idea presented by Mr. Murphy of not having a standing COVID update in the agenda every meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3255.369s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: My concern about taking it out of the agenda is that the public wouldn't be able to have public participation during the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3261.652s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think COVID topics are important and the public needs to be able to ask questions and get answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3266.494s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: In my experience, school committee meetings are the only way to get these answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3269.695s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: In the past, I've sent multiple questions to administration and I haven't received answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3275.418s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She notes nurses at the school level are fantastic and give us great information during our PTO meeting, but sometimes we want answers at the district level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=3795.942s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We can't see it at all, Peter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=4166.309s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=4167.55s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Could you just clarify?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=4168.971s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So the test has already been given to students K to 12?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=4693.64s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Did you still have a...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=4695.934s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=4697.275s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So it's given at the beginning of the year in October, February and June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=4703.38s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=6918.537s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There is a dress code is in the student handbooks, is at least mentioned in the student handbooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=6928.183s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So that would be a starting point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=6952.424s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The school committee is supposed to approve the handbooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=6955.304s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So it's just a point of that it's generally been<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=6960.653s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: there's been discussions over the dress code for many years at many different times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=6967.576s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I certainly support looking at it and updating it, but it's not like it's never been discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=6985.184s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, the refinement is that there's always been<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=6988.107s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: the understanding that the policy that we approved that the the handbooks and that becomes what you're saying is we don't have a separate one in our policy handbook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RleV0KFrhtE&t=7000.996s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Well we're quibbling over it but I'm just mentioning that it's in the handbook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=791.912s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=792.753s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think I should probably read them at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=796.915s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that all right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=797.936s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=798.256s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The first one is from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=811.038s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Christina McCourty 24 North Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=813.762s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She writes dear members of the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=817.987s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm the parent of two elementary school students and I'm writing with a few questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=822.712s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: One, at this point, is there any evidence that points to possible interschool spread of COVID-19?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=829.767s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Watching the COVID tracker there was an increase in positive cases in a couple of buildings, and many of us are wondering if there were multiple cases in the same classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=839.335s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you want to take this one by one or if we could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=998.312s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This parent goes on to say, is there any update on when buildings can transition back to testing twice per week?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1005.495s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She mentions that she knows the kindergarten students are being tested daily and says if that's happening, she would think we could handle testing all students twice per week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1015.703s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So if you might.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1114.163s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The third part of the email is, some first grade students have begun unmasking in class for phonics lessons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1121.188s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Though this was briefly mentioned in an email communication, no details have been given on what this looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1127.313s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We have a right to know what risks our students are taking and which health professionals weighed in on this decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1133.077s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Going forward, can someone from the district please give a detailed description of unmasked situations that have been deemed to be necessary for instruction?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1141.347s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: before they happen for the first time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1143.729s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Any unmasking brings risks, and I think families have the right to know of any increased risks they are facing at school so we can reflect on it, ask questions, and determine whether we decide if the risk is acceptable to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1156.777s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Many students are also anxious about being unmasked indoors, and knowing in advance would give us caretakers the ability to prepare them and discuss it in a safe place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1237.429s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, I'll turn to the next person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1242.391s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This one is Ingrid Moncada 131 virgin have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1249.336s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I have a few questions regarding COVID protocols at MPS, and she writes in parentheses, a comprehensive document with MPS current policies would be ideal, so we'd have to keep asking questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1260.965s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: One, what's the data that supports the decision of testing kindergarten in such a different way than the rest of the students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1268.891s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Why now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1269.431s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Was there evidence of in-school transmissions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1322.767s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, this one touches on what you've just talked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1326.948s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: What's the criteria for quarantining a whole class?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1329.849s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is it because the whole class is considered close contact?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1332.93s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: How can that happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1334.33s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: How often does that happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1335.85s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is it only in kindergarten classes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1395.188s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Part three, what are the guidelines for students returning to school after being sick at home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1399.832s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I've heard reports of people having to provide proof of coven negative and pay for a private PCR test.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1406.065s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: before being accepted back in school, and others that are not told anything, and just bring the kids back as soon as they feel better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1556.218s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The parent goes on to say, has the district or city considered providing free COVID testing for NPS families at schools after hours City Hall or other Medford location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1567.088s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If families are indeed required to provide proof of negative test before returning to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1571.572s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This would be essential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1702.042s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1702.622s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That's all the letters that I received.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=1706.252s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: on the school committee mailbox.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=4838.394s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It was very interesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=4838.874s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: A couple questions just sort of in understanding the scope of your work in our district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=4843.877s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: you've outlined three different areas, which I assume are for all K to 12 teachers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=4857.647s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: All K to 12 staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=4858.828s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So like, we don't have that much time for professional development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=4864.572s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: When are you coming in and how many people are coming in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=4867.535s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And if you could just give us an understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=4987.03s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess if I could go back, though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=4989.112s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=4989.933s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So as you're training the in-district, what is the scope of that work?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=4995.897s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: How many people are you training?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=4997.619s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: How many people are you meeting with?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5065.971s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5066.911s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Just one more question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5070.413s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You say taught in our book, social emotional learning in the classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5075.294s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Are those resources that are used, is that something that the school committee can take a look at?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5102.61s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So we can go find it in your office, Dr. Cushing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5105.332s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5128.266s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is it available online?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5278.411s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: What I need to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5279.472s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5595.979s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I find it a little confusing, actually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5599.961s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Part of it is the wording is presentations of the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5602.942s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And does the presentation mean a statement or, for instance, a letter?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5646.359s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Right now, I have another letter that has been submitted to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5660.822s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It doesn't have to do with anything particular on our agenda so it wasn't a pub.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5665.088s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That's why we did earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5667.21s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: have a public comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5668.491s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, Mayor Sorry, remember Ruseau?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5674.494s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So but we've always had an opportunity for people if this person was here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5680.497s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Earlier in the meeting where it used to be, they would<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5693.747s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's my fear is that you're cutting out the ability of a person to ask a question, which I understand isn't necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5704.431s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Like if I read this letter, I'm not expecting that there's going to be a dialogue, but the person wrote it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5710.714s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I thought that we did this whole thing about having letters submitted so that people who aren't here, we could read it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5750.0s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So in one hand, you're saying that the goal is to be inclusive and welcoming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5755.864s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And on the other hand, we're saying, but here's someone who's written a letter, but I can't read it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5762.869s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't really understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5787.809s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5813.921s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But this was submitted to the school committee account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5816.842s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: My job has been to read the letters that were submitted to the school committee account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5822.004s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This person chose that way rather than writing us individually, which I actually think that there's a benefit from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5830.1s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I understand that there would be no discussion about this, but to not read it, and again, I happen to know what the letter contains.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5838.065s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It could be anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5838.905s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm just making a general observation that it seems to me that we've become, with this policy, the well-intended to correct another problem is in fact causing another concern that I am articulating right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5855.823s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So this person, Monica Rushford, who submitted this letter, is not going to have her letter read tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5863.009s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I make a motion to read the letter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5876.227s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Hello, school committee members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5877.608s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm a Medford resident and a parent of Missy Tuck Elementary students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5880.829s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm curious whether there will be any kind of acknowledgement or dedication of the new name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5885.512s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I did see the banner on the front of the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5887.513s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd love to know if other signage or explanation of the significance of the name is under consideration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5892.636s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I heard, for example, about a mural on the playground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5895.817s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Would that be the school committee's decision or the school's?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5899.7s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you for all the work you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=5901.1s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Sincerely, Monica Rushford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=8042.983s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Very well member of and include needs to present to the school nurse, a physical copy of the PCR test.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=8279.506s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=8498.366s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=8500.525s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There's one on the next page, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hCz5uniVUiI&t=8501.426s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=3213.521s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I just wanna add, this is really exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=3219.022s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you for your work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=3219.882s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=3220.202s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=4391.66s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I thought it would make sense to me and yeah, appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=4524.748s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, this letter is from Cheryl Rodriguez of 281 Park Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=4530.372s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She writes, hello, I'm writing concerned about the lack of a permanent crossing guard at the intersection of Riverside Ave and Freedom Way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=4538.218s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There are three schools that utilize that crosswalk, the McGlynn Elementary and Middle School and the Andrews Middle School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=4545.142s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I am grateful that the Medford police cross children there when they can, but understandably, they need to leave it if there is a call leaving no one to cross our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=4554.629s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This is even more urgent as bus 11 formally dropped off at spring street and central lab was canceled for the middle school, and those children now have to walk without benefit of a crossing guard on that very busy street bus 11 was created because there were so many children on bus to that they could accommodate them all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=4573.153s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I am unsure of how many children lost bus service with this move.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=4576.614s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: likely inspired by the driver shortages, but the families received no notice and have added to the number of children likely unaccompanied that are crossing at the spot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=4587.382s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Please prioritize getting a crossing guard to this location immediately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6z-adtwoqbY&t=4592.386s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Cheryl Rodriguez.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=2601.438s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: What are we doing to support that students academics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=2606.4s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, I understand we have our limits, but it seems like now you know they're out for five days they're out for seven days, what if it's a second grader, what do we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=2789.417s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think, obviously, you would understand my concern for a student who's come back to school and then all of a sudden is out and might be out again a few weeks later and a few weeks later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=2800.002s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So anyway, I think that, you know, I know we've brought in some support people, I think we sometimes may need more, maybe as tutors for students who are out and so I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=2811.928s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This is something that I think we need to very closely monitor, and I'm most concerned about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=2903.981s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I have other questions but I'll yield to my colleagues, they can get an opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3393.448s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I just want to say I'm really glad that the high school testing is being revamped because that was one of my concerns after our visitation so that's good news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3403.658s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The other question I was just curious about is whether it may be too soon, but I'd like to know if what percentage of our, and I'll ask it as high school students but of our high school students are vaccinated do we know at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3741.454s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, just to follow up on member credits question, we had received a letter from a parent expressing concern that there were at least three kids in the bathroom when her daughter walked in periodically so you know I know I know it's tough to monitor at all but you know, I just wanted to your attention yeah the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3773.615s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, I think we might have all gotten it, but I'll make sure I forward it on to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3919.746s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3926.256s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, I read the document that member Ruseau provided to us in detail, and as a former representative to with shore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3934.868s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I am very familiar with shore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3938.132s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And in fact, remember, Hank Owen, the director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3943.403s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: of many years, very rightly, is a wonderful wonderful person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3949.67s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The question that came to me is that this is basically calling for a fund to be put aside for capital improvements for sure, which makes a great deal of sense, but I didn't see anything addressing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3964.506s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: the potential for, if by any chance, something should happen to the shore such that it would cease to exist, what would happen of the money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3976.852s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so there was no, I didn't see any line item which suggested that it would be split back between the districts or anything else like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3984.975s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And while it is perhaps far-fetched to believe something will happen after the successful run of shore, it seemed to me that some<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=3993.459s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: some notation should be made about what would happen to that account in the future if it was not used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4064.206s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, my suggestion is that simply that should be added to this document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4070.828s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And again, I'm happy to refer it to your attorney as to whether that needs to be or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4078.171s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But that was my one concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4080.711s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Otherwise, I would make a motion to support this paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4086.533s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4086.693s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4101.052s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Should it be a roll call?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4103.274s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it should be a roll call as regards to finances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4121.403s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4297.759s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4298.539s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member van de Kloet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4299.88s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I was asked to inquire about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4301.941s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So the original date that employees were supposed to give you documentation was September 8th, and then it was put off to the 17th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4311.285s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Could you explain why that happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4379.443s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that perhaps the interpretation might have been by some people that it was, oh, people aren't getting their stuff in, so we're giving them extra time, and they're dragging their feet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4388.686s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I wanted to make it clear that, in fact, we are having great cooperation with our labor units.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4434.2s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Right, well I think we're all very thankful to our labor units and I'd like to make a motion that the school committee endorse the agreements that were set forth around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=4447.024s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Would you say around the mandatory coven 19 testing and proof of vaccination requirements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=5357.165s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, member McLaughlin is next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6055.463s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6057.805s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: While we're under the topic of transportation, it would seem we received a letter from a member of the public, which would be appropriate to read at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6066.9s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Please, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6068.12s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So community member Eleanor Klein wrote us to the school committee account regarding bicycle racks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6078.063s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And she wrote that she wants to draw our attention to the bike racks at the middle and high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6086.645s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She included some photos of the bike racks, which she says the racks are outdated models<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6093.187s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: and unusable and difficult to use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6095.749s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: In addition, they represent a very small percentage of available space dedicated to students alternative non-fossil fuel dependent transportation options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6105.958s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She says she knows that the ones at the high school are frequently filled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6110.081s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm sure the bike commission CC here can be valuable resource for ideas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6114.967s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: With the partnership connector she writes the opportunities for middle schoolers to bike to school safely will be expanded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6121.212s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: In addition, we as a city need to work on ways to encourage more cycling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6125.216s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I would love it if we could start by making sure an ample quantity of usable racks are installed at our middle and high schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6132.982s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is there a plan or discussion around bike racks currently in our budget transportation planning?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6137.525s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If not, please make sure that this is added to the mix.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6140.467s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thanks very much, Ellery Klein.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6143.248s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I do want to note that Dr. Cushing did respond and is willing to further the conversation and work with whomever he can to make this happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6855.935s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We're allowed one delegate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6857.856s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6858.236s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Excuse me, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6861.124s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, we need to nominate our voting delegate in an alternative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6866.786s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And every school committee member is welcome to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6871.567s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This is just the particular voting portion of the resolutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6879.15s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6914.584s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'll still go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=6915.344s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just don't want to be the delegate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=7208.259s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, so I certainly would support this but I do want to let you know that it isn't the first time that it's been discussed that when we in fact built the new schools there were discussions about accommodating left handed students at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=7223.017s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It came up again over a period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=7226.62s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's one of those things that it's just always good, though, to check on whether they're in the right place at the right time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=7233.185s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And do we need more just because of the particular population?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=7237.408s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And of course, some of the deaths have bit the dust, so to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=7240.811s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So we might be replacing them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=7243.833s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We might have, I don't know, with right-handed deaths rather than left-handed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=7248.777s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I support the resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZvcDJHTayW4&t=7253.214s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that it's appropriate for us so since there is an expenditure potentially for us to get a report back so that we understand what we're asking for in terms of if we have an additional purchase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=380.709s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So looking at the, I don't know whether<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=384.925s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Rousseau who tabulated the responses wants to say anything at this point, but looking it over, I see that my colleagues hold you in the same high esteem that I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=396.547s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Because as I look over the different scores, all of which are often 3.5 or above with four being the highest, you can see that's truly a remarkable standard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=411.611s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=413.933s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that we all value so much what you set out this year, your achievement in getting kids back to school, holding the safety of our students to the highest level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=429.345s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think you should be really proud of yourself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=3233.162s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=3234.724s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: First, I did want to thank the team, those who presented yesterday to the City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=3240.774s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you for representing us so well and answering all the questions that were brought to you last night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=3250.143s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to go back to Suzanne.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=3252.225s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: When you were talking about the camp, sort of reintroducing kids back to school and whatever, what are the numbers that you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=3260.998s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Anticipate, how many kids can you accommodate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=3263.303s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I would hope that everybody who wants to go gets to go, but I wanted to understand how you're facing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=3380.248s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cu8VAJw3V-Y&t=3384.45s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=920.336s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Hey, Tony, you wrote this article.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=923.597s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=924.698s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=926.378s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's been quite a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=927.699s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I work with Tony and Lawrence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=929.259s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I followed her in one of the schools, and I followed her here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=932.381s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm so glad I did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=935.022s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We just appreciate all you've done for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=937.182s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You're always there to answer the phone and guide us through all the complex problems we've had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=943.965s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We really appreciate everything, Tony.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=946.426s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We're going to miss you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=959.369s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you for guiding us through a pandemic relentlessly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1088.824s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Kathy and I have the honor to present to you from the House of Representatives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1094.146s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Be it hereby known to all, the Massachusetts House of Representatives offers its sincerest congratulations to Toni Wray in recognition of your years of dedicated and outstanding service to the Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1107.611s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The entire membership extends its very best wishes and expresses the hope for future good fortune and continued success in all endeavors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1115.453s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Given this 14th day of June,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1118.105s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: 2021 Robert Leo Sean garbled a Christine Barber and Paul Donato Tony, I just want to take a second to say in addition to these words, you have just been invaluable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1128.925s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It is so wonderful to see your entire team here too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1132.127s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'd like to express our thanks to every one of you as well, because that's what Tony would want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1139.051s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So Tony, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1140.232s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so, so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1141.492s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you for all of your work up to the pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1144.154s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And then thank you for getting us through the pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1146.795s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Tony worked tirelessly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1149.157s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She worked on weekends around the clock to make sure that our students and teachers were safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1158.769s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=1981.569s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We took a roll call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2027.798s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Before we do that, after that, as we're taking things out of order, I would ask that we move on to the presentation<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2035.329s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: of the advisory committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2065.836s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor, I am happy to stay here to get to the entire agenda, no matter how late we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2072.12s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But in the meantime, we have an audience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2074.622s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And we know why they're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2075.722s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We have an advisory council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2077.043s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We know why that we're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2078.424s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We've already asked them graciously, not really asked, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2081.886s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: They graciously sat here for our wonderful presentation to Toni Wray.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2086.689s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We wanna take up our seventh graders and that I think it's only appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2090.512s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I guarantee you to my colleague, we will get to everything on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2096.076s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: No one's gonna rush out of here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2665.663s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2666.304s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The only thing is, I wondered whether we should specify one, because if there's one or more, or because sometimes if you're putting in one, putting in a second one might not be that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2677.29s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I don't want to limit it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=2702.353s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3189.052s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So this is our rubric, and it was used by our committee to evaluate the names of the submissions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3197.235s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The rubric outlined three different criteria.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3201.223s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: the potential for the name to bring the community together, two, the potential for the name to stand as a role model for Medford students, and three, the potential for the name to represent Medford community's proud history.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3216.45s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Each one of the criteria had a scoring range from one to four, four being the highest a name could receive in any category, and one being the lowest score that a name should have received.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3229.585s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thus, the top score of any one suggestion that they could receive is a 12, and any name with a 12 would be significant to multiple historically marginalized groups and not polarizing, known for exceptional deeds, community involvement, or contribution to society with a historical notable legacy that would last decades, or if it wasn't a person, it would still have historical significance that would last decades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3255.599s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And lastly, if it was a person,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3258.7s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: They would have lived in Medford with a Medford specific reputation, or if it was not a person, it would have a long standing ties to Medford with a positive history.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3272.866s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Our public participation process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3275.541s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: After all of the names were scored, the top scoring 15 names were to move on with the public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3282.989s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: However, due to a tie, we ended up with a top 17 names to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3287.553s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And then after looking at the list, we realized we had accidentally removed a name that should have been considered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3292.999s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So we therefore added that name on to continue with the process, leaving us with 18 names to present to the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3301.037s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: On May 11th, the committee adopted and formalized a process of how we should receive public input on those 18 names as outlined in a resolution brought forward by Heinrich Ginnies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3312.428s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And a subcommittee was established to create the public input form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3316.472s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And the survey was open for one week to collect written responses for or against any of the 18 names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3323.527s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The survey itself was translated into Spanish, Haitian Creole, Arabic, and Portuguese.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3329.271s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There were hard copies also made available at Medford City Hall and the superintendent's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3334.834s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And overall, the committee received over 1,200 online responses and 39 paper submissions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3346.582s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The top 18 names were also independently researched and rescored by each of the committee members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3352.867s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: via the process previously described by the rubric, all 23 members of the advisory committee did this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3360.055s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The scores were then collected, averaged, and ranked as one point for the committee members to consider.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3366.683s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The committee then moved forward to reduce the finalists down to the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3374.176s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Using an adopted process as outlined and brought forth by Patrick McCabe, the committee started with a list of names in alphabetical order, and if a committee member had stated that that name was their top three, that name would remain in consideration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3389.567s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If no one on the committee said they would include that name in their top three, that name was stricken from the list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3395.771s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This reduced the official list down from 18 to 13 names,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3400.069s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And next, every committee member was given up to three minutes to advocate for which nominee or nominees they thought should be sent forward to the school committee based on their own research, the rubric and public input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3413.493s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Each committee member voted for one of the nominees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3419.094s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And after the first round of votes were recorded, only three of the candidates had received a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3424.275s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And a motion put forth by Paul Donato Jr.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3427.474s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: was made that we should just accept those three and send them forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3431.596s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And that was adopted and the three names that received votes were on the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3441.079s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so our first few names that, these three names were Missituk, Jean Barry Sutherland, and Belinda Sutton.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3450.182s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The first of the three names here for you tonight is Missituk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3454.939s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The land that the city of Medford sits on was inhabited by the Massachusetts tribe and other Native Americans for thousands of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3463.541s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The indigenous people that lived on the land called the river Missituk, which means Great Tidal River.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3469.582s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: As English colonists came to the area, the name of the river was altered in a more familiar English word, Mystic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3478.663s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The river has been very important throughout the history of Medford, and it was used for fishing and for water by the indigenous tribe, and then by the colonists, and it also became essential for trade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3491.428s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It became a subject of poems, such as, Over the River and Through the Wood, and Paul Revere's Ride.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3497.651s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This river has been a source of community pride for centuries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3505.254s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The Missituk River,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3506.767s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: as previously mentioned, has been bringing people together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3510.189s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It was a source of the food and water for indigenous tribes and the first colonists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3514.832s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It then became a place that allowed Medford to take part in trade industry, being a port and preparing goods to ship out and even building ships.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3524.019s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The city of Medford grew because of the Mistook River.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3528.322s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And today, the river is used for walking, hiking, boating, fishing, and other various community events.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3536.032s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There is a widespread effort underway to continue to work to restore the river and the land surrounding it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3541.796s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And by using the Native American name, Misutuk, we are taking time to honor those who had originally inhabited these lands and taking a step to acknowledge the past and as we do this, stepping into the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3558.527s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: These are just three responses that we received from the community input survey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3564.704s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There were so many wonderful responses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3567.025s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And even though that this was not a vote, all of these responses were used and considered and provided the committee wonderful information into getting us to these final three names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3582.933s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: These three quotes here really exemplified why Missittook is a positive influence, not only for the city and for the students of the school,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3593.629s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: but also for the rest of the children in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3597.471s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Some of the feedback expressed that it was a reflection of the river and how the river has been a focal point for our community for centuries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3606.816s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: People also shared that it acknowledged the native people for who originally inhabited this land.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3613.439s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And it also provided a physical connection between our past and our present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3618.642s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It was also shared that people liked it because it wasn't a single person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3623.561s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: but rather it celebrated a shared space and an aspect of a physical environment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3631.247s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And lastly, Missittook represents Medford's proud history.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3636.751s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: As previously mentioned, the Missittook has been here long before Medford has even existed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3644.457s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The Missittook watershed was home to the indigenous people of Massachusetts prior to colonization of the area by the Europeans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3652.554s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The name may have morphed into Mystic, but it does not diminish the role or the value of the Missitook River and what it has played in building Medford by providing resources of not only food, but also trade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3666.483s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The river powered tide mills that allowed for the process of corn, tobacco, textiles, and wood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3673.768s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It was the home of the first bridge over the river, allowing the city to play a key part in the founding of this nation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3681.653s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The river is also the subject of well-known poems and stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3686.297s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And while the river may now be known as Mystic, the name Mistituk gives nod to those who came before us, honoring them and acknowledging their language and homelands.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3697.566s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's a reminder that Medford's history didn't start when the Europeans came here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=3701.909s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It began long before the first boats arrived.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4557.78s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, so at the present the 27 letters have ballooned over 40.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4563.202s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm going to I'm going to condense them where appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4568.955s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: first from, and I'm starting from the ones that, the first one that came in was from Carrie Parker of 6 Hurlcross Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4576.398s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She said, I am writing to you because I want to support the renaming of the Columbus Elementary School at tonight's school committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4583.68s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The school committee set up a transparent process carefully naming the committee, and the committee did extensive work to identify three possible names that reflect Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4592.244s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: They are inclusive, positive, and anti-racist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4594.344s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I am proud that Medford is taking a step forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4596.636s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: and look forward to seeing the committee's work completed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4598.777s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That's Carrie Parker, 6 Earlcroft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4601.258s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The next one is April Evans of 46 Brewster, April Evans and David Douglas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4607.502s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And they too support the renaming effort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4611.103s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: They do not specify, neither letter specifies the preference and choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4616.046s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The third letter is from Lizzie Wyatt of 134 Auburn Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4624.765s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She has two children who attend the Columbus Elementary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4629.068s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She strongly supports the Columbus School renaming and she would prefer the Belinda Sutton School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4638.675s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I deeply appreciate that we have the opportunity to honor a former slave who represents an important part of the history of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4649.322s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you for the opportunity to offer these comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4652.565s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The next one is from Michael Glenn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4656.002s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I like the idea of changing the school's name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4658.723s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I support Jean Barry Southerland.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4662.485s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'll do one more right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4664.866s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: My name is from Julie Bogart and I live at 132 Auburn Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4669.149s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: My daughter is currently a first grader and my son will start kindergarten there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4672.711s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I am writing to express my strong support of the current effort to rename the Columbus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4678.153s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I urge the committee to consider Belinda Sutton as the new school name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4681.516s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: because I can't think of a better way to both honor Medford's often unrecognized history and celebrate the diversity of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4688.302s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you for your efforts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4689.884s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Best, Julie Bogart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4691.445s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So those are the first five that I'll read right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4852.907s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4857.751s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The next one is from Dana McNamee, 173 High Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4868.496s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I support the name change to a positive, inclusive, and anti-racist name, Dana-Mae.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4874.539s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Then from Steven Daly of 132 Auburn Street, I have two children who will attend the Columbus Elementary School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4884.624s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: My oldest child is in first grade and my youngest is a kindergartner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4889.746s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I wish to fully support the Columbus Elementary renaming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4894.288s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I strongly support the changing the name to Belinda Sutton School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=4901.151s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And, should I do one more?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5282.842s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Next letter I received was from Ellery Klein.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5286.245s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Please know that I am supporting you tonight as you face a contentious meeting regarding the school name change for the Columbus Elementary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5292.209s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I would like to just offer one thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5293.991s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: A friend of color told me she felt that naming the school after an enslaved person, Belinda Sutton, was not inspiring for the kids of color in the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5301.417s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: While I initially liked the story as Mrs. Sutton used her obviously strong powers of persuasive writing and the US justice system of the time to earn her freedom and a recompense for her<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5312.546s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: experience of one of the worst injustices a human being can face and hopefully went on to a better life and freedom, I was willing to hear and absorb this perspective from my friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5322.475s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: While I do think it shows agency and power on the part of Miss Sutton, and one could argue that Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman were also enslaved, yet nevertheless,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5330.822s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: inspiring fears, I do want to make sure that we have heard from enough voices of color to feel comfortable choosing Belinda Sutton as the name should we choose to do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5339.084s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If the voices in support of the beloved Medford-educated Jean Barry Sutherland are still unanimous and no hidden secrets have emerged, I also think this is a fine choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5347.766s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: However, I would urge the mayor to set firm guidelines, which we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5352.187s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I fully remain in support of the name change of the Columbus to one that is more in line with justice, freedom, hope, and kindness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5359.189s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Regards, Ellery Klein.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5362.276s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The next letter is from Jen Lewis, in support of Miss attack.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5366.238s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm writing in support of the name miss attack for our self Medford elementary school, the school students voted for the name and their input is significant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5373.864s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I appreciate the name will recognize and honor the people so lived here for hundreds of years, and encourage all students to residents to learn more about their rich history in the theater community to which I belong over the last few years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5384.861s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We have begun each performance with a land acknowledgement, recognizing the often forgotten people who lived here before European colonization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5392.844s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Jen Lewis, 20 Russell Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5396.405s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Talia Andrea Lata, and I'm sorry if I'm butchering any names, from the 75 Lawrence Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5404.048s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I am writing to express my strong support for the name of the Columbus School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5408.229s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This is a symbolic decision that the Medford School Committee must make in order to express commitment to anti-racism<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5413.638s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: and equitable education in our public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5418.343s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The next one, Columbus name change from Carlene McGorty, 19 Austin Terrace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5424.048s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm writing to express my hope that you vote on the name change today and end this turmoil.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5429.654s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It is the right thing to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5434.195s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Personally, I liked the name Lydia Maria Childs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5437.677s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: However, now I think the name should not be a person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5439.778s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I wish South Medford Elementary School had been a suggestion, as there is no room for dispute over that one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5445.081s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Of the choices, I think Missituk would be a good name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5447.582s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I heard Missituk won the student vote, which should count for something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5451.264s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It honors our Native American history and our location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5454.666s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5875.831s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Some of you may recall, I am Native American and I am Southern Italian.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5880.874s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm an Italian immigrant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5882.635s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: My dad, I like to say, came to this country with lint in his pocket and a recipe for rock soup.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=5899.103s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So that is my background.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7026.599s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7027.515s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So these are emails that have been received into the school committee account that I am reading for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7033.919s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I am shortening them because of the pure numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7038.082s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Sarah Florence, 35 Sagamore Ave, in support of the name change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7043.505s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She prefers Belinda Sutton.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7045.246s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Talk about persevering despite having the odds stacked against you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7049.249s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Our miss attack, no future worries about naming the school after a person who turns out to be less than perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7056.189s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The next one is by Matt Weyant, W-E-Y-A-N-T of 134 Auburn Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7065.114s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I strongly support the proposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7071.898s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm sorry, I didn't hear what the comment was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7074.279s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's 134.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7074.399s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: 134 Weyant Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7081.804s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I strongly support the proposal to change the school's name to the Belinda Sutton School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7088.007s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Michael Denton, One Bellevue Terrace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7093.729s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: All three choices are fine, Missittook, Sutton, Sutherland.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7097.911s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I would, however, offer the following for your consideration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7102.533s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Of the three choices, Missittook would serve as an ongoing acknowledgement of the indigenous people for whom this land was stolen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7109.977s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: in the grand scheme of thing that represents a small step, but a step nonetheless toward healing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7115.121s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Another of the choices has been Linda Sutton would serve as an ongoing acknowledgement of the black people who were kidnapped from their homes in Africa and forcibly brought to the country and made to work as slaves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7126.189s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Your third choice, Jean Barry Sutherland would honor the first principal of the school and a person who had a big impact on a number of lives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7133.455s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: On the surface, it seems like a fine choice,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7135.609s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: However, given the larger historical, cultural, and societal context in which we are living, it would also be a choice that serves to reinforce the status quo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7143.435s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I imagine some might be thinking that choosing the name after Jean Barry Sutherland would be a good compromise name because she was a great educator who impacted a lot of our lives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7153.082s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But please remember this, it's never been more clear than it has over the past five years that this country needs healing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7161.228s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Shall I go on to a different?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7165.256s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, we've got people standing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7167.117s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, yeah, we'll take, and then we have, and then we're gonna go to virtually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7170.278s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Hello, hello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7549.362s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll continue with reading letters that came in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7554.685s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: From Barry Ingbar of 9 Draper Street, he writes, I support a new name for the Columbus School that is positive, inclusive, and anti-racist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7566.733s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Terry Biscardi of 28th 9th Street says, I am okay with all three options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7575.439s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I am thankful for changing the name<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7577.912s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Columbus School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7579.273s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Maura Albert of Arlington, we'll skip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7585.918s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Lisa Eichel says of 19 Dearborn Street, I think it would be a wonderful to rename the Columbus School and hope you'll vote tonight to make this change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7596.065s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We should have a name that all of the community is comfortable with, not just some.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7601.609s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Maggie Petillo of 32 Irving Street says, just wanted to thank school committee and show my support for renaming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7608.943s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We want an inclusive anti-racist and progressive name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7612.186s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Katie Ryan writes, Katie Ryan of 15 Canal Street says, I write to you tonight for the last time to urge you to be strong tonight and to stick to your morals and what you know is right, even in the face of hatred, even when people don't actually know you, disparage you, and accuse you of character traits and political agendas that you do not have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7633.499s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I am able to write you because I was a recipient of special education services when I was a child in the 1980s and 1990s.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7640.264s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: When the Columbus Elementary School was first named, I would not have been able to attend it, and neither would many of my friends and loved ones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7646.769s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I am glad that progress meant I would be included in schools, even though when kids with disabilities first went to public schools, people didn't like it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7654.755s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Today, disabled people are included because people fought for change and fought for equality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7659.158s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: People change, times change, and we see positive progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7664.278s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7665.578s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mimi Oliver writes, I strongly support changing the Columbus School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7673.681s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Name does not name a particular person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7678.802s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Katie Lagusa of 93 Gaskin says, I'm writing in support of changing the name of the Columbus School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7688.865s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So Columbus Day and all of the family emphasis on Columbus Day that followed is related to my family history.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7694.093s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: My dad's family immigrated from Sicily and faced discrimination here in the U.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7699.255s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: My understanding is that Columbus Day was created in part as a way to uplift Italian heritage in the U.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7705.277s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: and to ease tensions between the U.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7706.917s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: and Italy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7710.358s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Columbus was one of the many people who changed the world through colonialism and capitalism.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7716.26s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: All students should learn about him and the truly new interconnected world he helped to bring about as they study history.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7722.858s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: but I do not want my children to have to extend a school named after someone who represents the beginning of an era of mass exploitation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7731.802s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: What is the holdup?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7735.924s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I love the idea of naming our school after a local courageous and creative person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7741.026s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Lisa Foss of 78 Sagamore Ave says, while I understand that when the Columbus School was named, the name was chosen with the best intentions and I believe that should be remembered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7751.598s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: However, as we become more aware of how we have neglected to meet the needs of everyone in our community, I truly believe it is time to change the name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7759.505s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Diane Bellinger writes, I am writing in support of changing the name of the Columbus School to something more positive, inclusive, and anti-racist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7767.232s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I stand with the children of the Columbus who chose Missitook or Belinda Sutton as the new name for their school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7773.657s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Teresa Racicot of One Bellevue Terrace writes,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7779.042s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The three names you were voting on are all fine choices, but two of the names show conscious thought of Medford moving towards a more inclusive and anti-racist future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7788.607s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: When we think of the horrendous acts of genocide, renaming the school to honor either the indigenous name, this area, or to honor a black woman enslaved at the royal house, who was the first African to ask for reparations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7802.654s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Clearly one can see that either name is a good choice towards healing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7805.795s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I hope that you vote for one of these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7807.296s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This is my ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7809.153s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That's Teresa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7811.314s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: T. Stash, this message is to support the name change of the Columbus School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7816.516s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I believe the name should be new, inclusive, positive, and anti-racist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7820.478s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She's of 7 Wildwood Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=7824.3s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There weren't more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8803.011s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, sorry, how many devices?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8808.292s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: From<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8809.659s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Tamara Morrow of 7 Wildwood Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8812.481s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The message is to support the name change of the Columbus School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8815.644s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I believe the name should be new, inclusive, positive, and anti-racist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8822.109s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Lauren Zawanda of 14 Webster Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8825.271s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I support the Columbus name change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8828.814s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I want something positive, inclusive for all of our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8832.437s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Seth Hill we heard from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8834.899s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Kate Elwell, my name,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8837.785s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: is Kate Elwell, and I live at 55 Windsor Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8841.247s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: My children will be starting kindergarten at the formerly Columbus School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8845.39s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I support renaming the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8846.751s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I like all three choices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8848.692s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Julia Roberts, again, supports any of the choices, just would like to change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8856.156s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That's 254 Arlington Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8858.978s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Jennifer Yanko.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8864.341s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I support the change of the Columbus School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8867.502s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: and does not specify which of the names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8871.064s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Jessica Farrell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8874.885s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: My preference among the names is the one the student survey showed most support for, Missituk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8881.268s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Monica Rushford of 44 West Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8884.009s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I urge you to adopt a new inclusive positive name, anti-racist name at tonight's meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8889.651s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The time is now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8891.652s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Christine, sorry, Wendy Cliggett.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8896.838s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: of 7 West Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8902.322s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This is a longer one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8907.004s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It is my hope that the school committee will choose the name Mistah, the Native American word for the Mystic River, meaning the great tidal river.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8914.269s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It is the backbone of Medford and what binds us as a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8918.732s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: People originally settled here because of the river.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8920.853s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Over the years, it was misused, polluted, and neglected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8923.495s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Many did not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8924.639s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: realized that the river was polluted due to its beauty and seemingly healthy flow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8929.663s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Raw sewage was expelled into the river.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8936.788s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And she goes on speaking about the river.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8939.33s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mrs. Tuck reminds us of those who came before us and our obligation to respect our city's lifeblood and our planet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8946.675s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It would be naming the school for our river is symbolic of the common bonds that flow through our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8957.088s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That was Wendy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8958.73s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Then this is Christina McGuarty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8964.315s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you for continuing to work toward getting a new name for the Columbus School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8970.821s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The children at CES voted, and Misato came in first, Belinda Sutton second, and Jean Barrett came in third.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8977.687s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it's important that everyone knows how they voted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8982.099s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Many adults have made this issue so divisive over the last year and they see the names as choosing sides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8987.122s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we owe it to the kids to take their thoughts into consideration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=8990.404s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I also think Mr. Tuck best addresses the request of many of the teachers at the Columbus Elementary School to have a name that wasn't in honor of an individual and to not make anyone feel left out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9004.631s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Lisa Hodson, I live on Lyman Avenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9008.554s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, she spoke, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9012.763s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Jen Lewis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9015.725s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, sorry, that was about the, she supports the electric car charging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9022.511s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Ingrid Moncada.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9028.576s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Has her kids in the Columbus School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9030.418s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I feel very grateful that the name is going to be changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9035.267s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: When I listened to the letter that the Columbus teachers wrote to the committee, I found myself in complete agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9039.91s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: In the letter, they point out that renaming the school with the name of a place rather than a person is a more neutral option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9046.175s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Therefore, I'm writing in support of the name, Missituk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9051.699s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Jen Zawadsas, 20 Corrine Road, that's Z-A-W-A-D-Z-K-A-S, sorry for the mispronunciation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9063.381s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I would like to end my voice to support Mr. Orr Sutton.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9068.424s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Scott Sitaki, 131 Budget Ave, Burgett Ave in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9078.089s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Please note that how many people talk in favor of the name tonight's student effective results, community participation is not a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9088.674s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We just received<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9091.092s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And the last one that I have right now is from Jack McGoldrick, father of third grader, Ethan McGoldrick of the Columbus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9099.897s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I hear the children of the school have chosen either the name Missituk in honor of the Native American tribe or Belinda Sutton in honor of the woman who helped initiate an end to slavery in the area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9112.244s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think those are great names and I stand behind the children's choices 100%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9115.005s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Please add my vote alongside theirs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9926.261s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: 30 seconds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9994.452s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, wait, I now have two more letters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=9996.773s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, I'm going to let Mr. Puccio.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=10423.911s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so I received two more letters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=10427.313s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: One was from Michelle Chiccolo and she had sent the school committee actually a letter earlier about reaching out to the Mass Center for Native American Awareness just to get a clarification about the using of indigenous names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=10445.565s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: As we heard clarified before, that has to do with using names for sports teams and they would,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=10453.024s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: would not see the are using of Misita in a negative light.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=10458.066s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So just a clarification there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=10460.047s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And then we had Jeremy Raeland from Brewster Road and a parent of a second grader at a Columbus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=10465.269s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I agree with the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=10466.25s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Let's show how the democratic process works and go with the name they chose, Misita.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=10472.413s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, member VanderKloof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=10697.087s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Can I make a motion, Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=10701.11s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Can I make a motion that we each state our first choice as a straw poll to see where we all are right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=10709.515s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mia, I would rather, I would like to be able to make a statement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=10714.579s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=10715.179s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If you want to change your motion that we each make a statement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=10718.001s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You can make a statement if you'd like to make a statement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=10721.223s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=10721.703s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=10723.464s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Point of clarification, point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=10725.986s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is public comment complete now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=10731.569s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to be clear about whether the public can continue to participate or if they cannot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=10752.317s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There's a member here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11269.571s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Are we closing public participation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11272.333s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't want to speak until we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11273.935s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, nobody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11275.816s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is there a motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11277.398s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I make a motion to close public participation at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11305.446s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll turn it over to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11307.087s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11308.588s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm going to address several things as I speak tonight, things that really need to be talked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11314.772s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I want to tell you that I really haven't felt this nervous coming to a school committee meeting, and that makes me incredibly sad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11322.837s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This whole divisiveness in our community makes me incredibly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11327.984s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: sad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11329.345s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's been really, really tough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11331.526s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But I looked out here and I felt better when I came in because I said, oh, wait, why was I nervous?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11336.289s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: These are, I know these people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11337.65s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: These are my friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11338.391s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: These are my neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11339.571s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: These are the person who walks down my street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11341.853s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I know these people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11343.374s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But yet sometimes during the course of this evening, I've not been feeling very happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11348.217s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I know you mean to support each other by the calls and cat calls and whatever, but that's not what we're about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11355.66s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: What we are about is that we've got three great names before us and we're making a very difficult change for some.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11363.305s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And that for me is extremely important because I have to be true to myself and people, there will be, no matter what I do, there will be people who are going to be unhappy with my decision or my colleagues' decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11376.052s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I ask you, by the way, don't, after I speak,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11379.164s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Don't clap or catcall and don't do the same for them either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11382.846s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Let us have an intelligent discussion now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11385.247s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You may disagree with us, but I have to tell you, everyone is coming here after giving so much thought and so much pain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11397.532s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I listened to, after when we brought out this discussion, one of the biggest things that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11404.454s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: that is motivating me for my discussion is hearing some of the portion of our community who felt disenfranchised by our removing the name Columbus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11417.646s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I voted to remove the name Columbus because I thought it was the right thing to do, but I heard pain in people speaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11426.134s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I very much recognize that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11428.035s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: and appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11429.098s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: By the way, before I go on, I do want to call out to the advisory committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11433.611s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I thank you and appreciate the work that you did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11436.61s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: did we know how incredibly difficult we were going to put you into a particular circumstance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11442.414s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I didn't agree with all of you of what you said when I got to watch pieces of it, but I certainly understood and appreciated the commitment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11449.699s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And frankly, I felt kind of sorry for you at times when you got to the wordsmithing part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11455.023s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And then the other part that was very amusing was when you were talking about the school committee, it was this bunch of overs, what were we going to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11460.987s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just mentioned that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11463.329s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But anyway, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11467.253s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: My long-term here on the school committee means that there were names who were on the list who didn't make it in to even that list of whatever it was, 17 or 18 people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11478.939s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Tony Lucci, my God, what a guy he was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11482.321s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: He owned the sports store.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11484.001s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: He loved kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11485.502s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: He gave every kid, if they needed some free shoes or something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11489.624s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Now we have recognized Tony.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11491.685s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We put his name up on the corner, but he's a guy who was terrific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11496.324s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Miriam Morrissey, another fabulous educator, a person in our community, sister of Amelia Earhart, but someone who really stayed and worked in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11507.629s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I didn't get to meet Alphonse Fresa, but he was the editor of the Medford Mercury, and they used to call him Mr. Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11516.872s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If we were doing this years ago, his name would have been at the top of the list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11521.554s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Ray Murano was superintendent of schools, and there were others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11526.092s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, part of the interesting thing about this is what we remember.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11530.415s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Where are we calling?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11531.956s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, I have an advantage over some of my committee members because I knew Jean Barry Sutherland personally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11539.12s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I knew her well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11541.021s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I have that advantage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11544.724s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: When I think about the others and people have said, do the right thing, but of course, do the right thing means something different to each one of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11550.808s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So it's like, do the right thing, do the right thing, but we're interpreting that in different ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11555.216s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: For me, I'm being true to what I've said and true to myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11560.159s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think Belinda Sutton's story is amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11563.201s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I want to celebrate her in Medford, not at the Royal House, but someplace else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11569.265s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't have authority to name other things in the city, but maybe when we look, the Belinda Sutton community room at the new library, the Belinda Sutton something, I think that we can, what we have learned about her in this process is extraordinary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11585.376s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And there's appreciation from everybody of saying, yeah, wow, I didn't know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11589.358s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: By the way, our kids do get to go to the royal house in fifth grade, and they do learn about Belinda Sutton at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11596.182s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Just wanted you to know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11597.523s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: They do, it's there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11599.344s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So maybe they don't remember it, but it's there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11603.727s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Missituk, I also totally appreciate the name and the origin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11608.29s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I walk next to the Mystic River every single day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11612.092s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: As I look at that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11614.4s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The biggest concern for me is in fact, the students who had the poll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11619.244s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Tuck got 107 votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11621.406s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Jean Barry got 84.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11623.008s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Belinda Sutton got 86.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11625.43s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So if I look at 84 and 86, that's 170.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11627.292s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So then there is, you know, it was a three-way vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11630.695s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It wasn't a two-way vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11632.016s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, of course, democratically, if it's, you know, whoever gets the highest vote, I am stuck with that because I wonder if Jean Barry would be saying, go with the kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11639.863s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's my only problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11641.872s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But I knew Jean Barry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11643.353s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I knew her when she was selected to represent Medford in Nobioka, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11649.318s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That was an incredible honor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11651.22s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Two educators were going off to represent Medford in our sister city of Japan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11656.604s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And for years, we also had students who were selected, the highest students who got to go and visit Nobioka, our sister city, and in return, they came here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11667.533s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Jean was the first one who got to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11669.494s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It was fabulous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11671.315s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I knew Jean when she was a teacher at the Dane, and I knew Jean when she welcomed me into the Columbus School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11678.62s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And she said, as she looked around her classroom, her school, as she toured me, and she said, look at this, isn't this great?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11688.467s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Look how many students we have from all different countries and all different places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11695.472s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Jean Barry always had a smile across her face.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11699.154s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She was inclusive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11701.343s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She was involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11704.724s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You can't really say a bad thing about Jean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11706.824s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Someone said it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11709.685s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm lucky.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11710.205s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I knew her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11712.326s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I wish everybody knew her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11715.107s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She has been at the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11717.207s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There is a tribute to Jean Barry at the school and has been since her death with the sign saying Jean Barry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11728.569s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That happened because she was so valued.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11731.011s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And when she died, man, it was awfully hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11734.073s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I remember how many people were crying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11736.594s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It was such a loss in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11739.456s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm gonna support, that would be my first choice, would be Jean Barry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11744.499s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't want you to clap or anything else like that because you agree with me, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11749.782s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Unfortunately, sometimes in here, there's a feeling that it's been divisive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11756.161s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Jean Barry was an educator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11757.822s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: As I pick an educator as a member of the school committee, I am upholding every educator that we have had in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11764.885s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Every teacher, every principal, every superintendent, everybody who has committed themselves to education, to me, we can look and we can say to the kids, education is so important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11776.536s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: that this community recognizes an educator on the name of one of our buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11781.861s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That is the perspective that I come from and that I bring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11786.205s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that the other names are fantastic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11788.648s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I hope we utilize them in our community in a different way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11794.233s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: One last thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11796.035s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I take exception.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11798.24s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: to the person and the commentary that has happened that has said this school committee didn't function about our education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11805.909s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We only worried about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11808.032s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I need to say this to you as someone who has been on the school committee for many, many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11813.538s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This school committee worked hard<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11816.361s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This school committee, yes, we had this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11819.363s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It was at the right time and we could debate that till we were blue in the face.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11823.124s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We don't need to go there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11824.565s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But what we do need to let you know is in the month of March, this school committee had 23 meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11831.539s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Earlier, when we started out, we took Toni Wray, our nurse, and we held her up because she's been such an incredible force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11839.761s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This school committee, our administrative people, our school committee members, we're not looking for your praise, but to sit here and hear you say you didn't care about our kids is simply wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11852.024s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And if I don't say it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11853.965s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: okay, I cannot live with the feeling of just sort of sitting here and nodding my head and saying, oh, yeah, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11859.727s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That was true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11860.587s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That wasn't true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=11861.628s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We worked damn hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12314.615s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess I'm just, I wasn't sure of the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12317.097s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If we're all making a statement, is that a straw poll?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12320.059s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If you don't want to make a statement, we can do a roll call, but you just need a motion on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12324.381s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, probably just saying a name probably doesn't give people an understanding of where I was coming from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12329.745s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So like everyone else, this has been a challenging year, and I'm glad we're here tonight to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12338.691s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: They are three great names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12341.337s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: saw Lewin Topper at our son's baseball game the other day and we had a conversation about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12347.579s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You might remember that a few months back the school was originally or the school was originally in the mystic a few months back I made a motion to just let's return to the name of the original school<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12357.623s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: that did not move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12359.604s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I still think Mystic made the most sense, but now we're at this point and I do think the Mississippi Tech makes the most sense that it is something that is all-encompassing because it is more about geography and that the students are all very supportive of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12380.932s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I do want to say I did not know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12386.539s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Unfortunately, I did not know Miss Jean Barry Sutherland.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12389.14s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I didn't have the opportunity and hearing her sister speak made me wish I had the opportunity to meet her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12396.902s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I appreciate her husband being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12399.503s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I, my heart goes out to them for someone who's, you've lost someone so young, but I do want to say that I think for the community moving forward, I think the river is something that is, that is connected to all of us here and that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12418.665s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I wasn't going to share this story because you never know how people take it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12424.17s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: My father<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12427.056s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: He grew up in Ireland, but always driving up Fulton Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12429.517s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I grew up at 350 Fulton Street, and my father always going up the hill, he would say, you know, Mia, long before us, there were Native Americans who walked up Fulton Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12438.203s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It wasn't called Fulton Street, obviously, but to Wright's Pond, and that's where they got their water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12442.366s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And as a kid, it never really registered with me that there were people here before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12447.029s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And now it kind of came full circle for me that this is an opportunity to recognize the Native Americans and the tribes that were here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12455.526s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: before us, long before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12457.247s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I appreciate all the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12459.707s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I've had a lot of great conversations, a lot of great email exchanges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12463.088s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I, I feel like I do have a piece about us that we are moving forward in that we can all work together to make Medford inclusive and welcoming for everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12475.892s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12478.433s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12478.713s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Mustone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12621.714s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The appropriate way to do it, Mayor, would be to have us each state, I mean, like, that's the name probably that we would go for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12631.001s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I did receive another, I was distracted only because I saw another letter came in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12636.005s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But we closed...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12637.586s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12638.526s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12700.937s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Jean Barry Sutherland.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12777.135s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=12957.506s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Can I make a friendly amendment if...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14186.617s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, who are working and then all of a sudden now there's another I mean, you know, so part of me is saying, it seems like would also be incumbent on us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14195.843s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And we might have to speak to Megan fiddler carry about this to also be able to provide some sort of daycare options on those unusual holidays.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14205.75s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We're not a majority of the kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14207.847s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, like let's Christmas, people are going to be off, but all of a sudden I'm concerned about these, especially when they're floating holidays.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14216.89s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, so I, I think that has to be now foremost on our mind if we adopt this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14223.532s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, so anyway, just my thoughts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14308.863s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor, but you see, one of the other things I have a concern about is if we're and you know, I absolutely understand why we should.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14318.791s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But if we're elongating the school year, then all of a sudden we're elongating because we're also going to observe Juneteenth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14327.698s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so there's the potential then that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14330.916s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, because we've elongated now, like this year, it doesn't matter because school is over before Juneteenth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14337.477s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So, you know, it's just, I can't help but be concerned because I know in the years when all of a sudden, and Kathy mentioned school finished, you know, the 28th or 29th, it's awful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14349.78s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so that's my biggest concern with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14354.061s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Again, I didn't look, you say that you've worked it out for,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14361.297s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: 21, 22, 22, 23, which?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14362.037s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This won't start until 22, 23.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14366.661s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And it worked out that year okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=14983.107s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: we used to call community participation and say, I just want to bring to your notice that there's a movie night at the Columbus and we'd like you to come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15022.525s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But that's, you know, I think that's actually newer because we used to do community participation and someone could get up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15030.187s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, they were always supposed to, the old rule was you were always supposed to inform the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15038.876s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: superintendent's office on the Wednesday before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15041.419s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But frankly, that often is difficult for people who just want to get up and say, hey,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15048.186s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: know so so here um every any presentation that someone wants to do will go through the superintendent's office right is what you're saying for which is a current policy we don't follow people can speak on a community item but they can't get up in community participation and just say anything um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15070.492s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, sometimes what we always used to just sort of, but the person would say to a committee member, um, uh, I want to speak on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15078.555s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And usually, um, then we would ask the chair, whether we could, whether it was permissible mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15085.037s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15085.757s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So you don't want to do that at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15139.78s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But I guess what I'm trying to do, Paul, is I appreciate what you're trying to say is it's the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15146.636s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm also trying to, and part of this is conjecture, trying to say, hey, how are we being realistic because somebody like the PAC would like to come forward and say, hey, we've got a PAC meeting on next Wednesday and we'd really like you to attend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15172.578s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: In her report, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15175.861s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I may be trying to, it's late and I may be trying to come up with too many.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15277.789s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: May I ask a question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15279.51s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Did you, when passed our attorney, the section on appealing and authority determination,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15295.6s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The superintendent may seek advice from the district council about whether to proceed with the following appeals process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15301.542s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Should the council determine that a presentation cannot proceed, the presenter will be informed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15306.705s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The appeal will be placed in the next scheduled regular meeting of the school committee under the president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15310.607s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just want to know, usually I would have run something like that by Howard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15323.321s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'd like to amend the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=15325.485s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is there a motion for approval on this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16327.67s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16329.592s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member van der Kloof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16331.733s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't understand the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16334.198s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: where, how the flexibility of the meeting and the superintendent can start the meeting at different times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16339.823s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I truly just think that makes it more complicated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16342.446s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that, um, I think we were trying to come up with a standard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16348.311s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We start at 6 30 when it's a regular school committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16351.895s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16354.649s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm a little mystified how that works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16358.812s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm also mystified because the report of the superintendent, that's the funny part, because for me, that's always like, to me, that's been, okay, that's the most important thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16367.199s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That's the meat of the, that's, you know, so it's funny to me, the presentations of public, the resolutions, you know, I'm a little mystified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16381.549s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It might work and I'm just not seeing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16386.727s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, the other thing is at the consent agenda, I think, but I'm not sure, but I'm gonna ask Mr. Murphy this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16394.009s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I thought that if it had to do with finances, like the approval of payrolls or the approval of bills, those two things have to be roll call votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16405.551s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that correct or not?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16415.774s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16416.514s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So you'll roll call vote it all as a group?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16423.536s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And it'll include all of those things?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16428.737s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16430.658s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Can we do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16433.739s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Again, I just don't know, because we've always done those things separately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16492.796s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But if someone gives us a donation and it's financial, we have to do a roll call vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16505.599s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We've just always done it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16506.999s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I was told we had to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16508.319s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, whether that's true or not, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16527.374s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so you would say this paragraph, consent agenda, and including the approval of payrolls and the approval of bills, that's all okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16543.575s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't think we have anything that says no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16557.34s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Can this and our start time of 6.30 work together?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16566.342s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm asking the committee members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16568.203s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm asking the committee members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16584.015s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: No, I'm saying that we have, that we start the roll call for attendance of members at 6.30.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16589.459s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, okay, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16591.9s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And the consent agenda, and that's done all before, and the report of the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16596.944s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But again, to me, that those things can all proceed at 6.30.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16603.845s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So, and the only thing that you want to make sure that we don't start before seven is the presentations of the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16614.073s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Ruseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=16645.682s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: All I want to understand is what time is the meeting going to start?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17022.761s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17027.664s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She stepped out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17029.125s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She stepped out for a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17036.23s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17038.061s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So it was six in the affirmative and one stepped out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17044.965s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Superintendent, now it's time for your report, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17065.737s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Sure, community participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17069.138s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Any citizen in the audience may be given permission to speak once at school committee meetings regarding any item on the agenda for up to three minutes on any one item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17078.322s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: A community participation portion of the agenda will be established which will give any citizen the privilege of placing any item before the school committee to be heard on any item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17088.766s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Any item to be presented must be submitted in writing to the superintendent of schools<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17092.988s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: by the Wednesday noon prior to the scheduled meeting with a maximum of five minutes allowed for any one presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17099.493s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Public participation emails, questions or comments can be submitted during the meeting by emailing medfordsc at medford.k12.ma.us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17108.999s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Those submitting must include the following information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17111.941s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: One, your name and last name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17113.222s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Two, your Medford street address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17114.823s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Three, your question or comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=17117.338s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, number eight, number one, superintendent's updates and comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18314.004s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I make a motion that we do it on Thursday, June 24.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18320.566s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18321.966s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Roll call, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18572.637s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Point of clarification?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18577.24s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Does this include then both breakfast and lunch?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18581.283s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And what is the approximate cost that we should anticipate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18641.001s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But is it so so Paul, obviously, this is a good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18646.681s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: good thing that we want to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18648.742s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it's incumbent on us to understand what the cost and impact will be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18674.316s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So we have a, look, nobody wants to vote against this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18681.441s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Nobody does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18682.622s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I certainly think it's in with my purview to ask a question about what is the financial impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18688.927s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I need to know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18690.508s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We need to know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18694.391s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so the question is if we're going to move on this, because we've done some other things in our budget, all things that we want to keep,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18702.681s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, obviously, if there's ESSER funding for next year, that would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18708.023s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know whether, you know, would this come under ESSER funding?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18713.985s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: May I ask Mr. Murphy if he would know the answer to that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=18721.928s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You can say no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19078.631s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, did anybody say motion to approve?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19082.353s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19208.097s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So the question is, if we vote for this, it just says we're going to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19217.926s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm asking, but what's the impact?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19225.72s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, I don't want to vote against this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19228.202s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's the right thing to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19229.083s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: On the other hand, we do have some families who can afford it, but I understand what you're saying, Paul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19235.348s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So there's already three members listed here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19240.493s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So, you know, just call it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19248.46s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not used to voting on something which I don't understand how we're going to fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19259.238s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So when we have that meeting next week on the 24th, which is a budget meeting, can we have a report back on this so we know how we're going to fund it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19268.961s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Because what I'm thinking is we've just shown that we're going to be $700,000 approximately, shorter of what we requested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19280.645s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And now this is potentially another, shall I say, $750,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19502.556s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5r8Hhmlpsmo&t=19505.918s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So with that explanation, I think it's okay to pass this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=607.841s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=609.382s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So Superintendent Marisa Edward-Vincent, I think that you continue to do an exceptional job under the most difficult of circumstances this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=619.591s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: At every turn, I think that you've certainly displayed an incredible commitment to your role, to being available to us, to the community, to the kids at every turn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=633.983s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: As the four standards are outlined,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=636.298s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that you have met them all and done an exemplary job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=643.621s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I thank you and I look forward to your continued leadership in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=841.58s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=847.086s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: One question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=847.706s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, Member Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=848.826s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is the meeting that we're going to have to confirm the budget a committee of the whole, or are we going to add a regular meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=856.588s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: What does it have to be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=930.151s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member McLaughlin, could you repeat it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=931.412s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We were just trying to figure out the scheduling, so I missed what you said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=937.836s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, Member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=958.656s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So no more the week of June 27th?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1057.591s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1058.472s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think that what we're thinking, but if we could just look and determine when we think the special meeting would be, what is the latest that the city council can give us the budget<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1075.205s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's usually, I know it has to be done by the 30th, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1079.966s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Their last Tuesday meeting is the 29th of June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1083.307s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So does that mean that we are going to, our special meeting will be held on the 30th?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1090.089s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Just in case, I mean, if they have to, if they go all the way to the 29th to confirm the budget, then it would suggest that our special meeting would be on the 30th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1102.99s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1105.252s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I really need to set the date so I know what, you know, if we do it the previous week, we might not yet have the budget from the City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1115.223s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1118.747s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That's correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1119.748s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1120.108s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So therefore, I make a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1122.397s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: that the special meeting be held on Wednesday, June 30th?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1125.798s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1126.778s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1127.139s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Superintendent, is that a date?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1139.703s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Do we think that the city council might be done sooner so we could do it on Monday the 28th?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1241.904s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The truth of the matter is we never had a final approval meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1244.727s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: What happened was we submitted it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1247.049s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We always understood that the city council has never declined the amount that we submitted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1255.516s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So this is something new that we're doing this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1261.885s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, it's difficult because if they go all the way to the end, you know, we can't really, if they haven't voted the budget, how can we accept it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1275.318s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This really is a question I think Mr. Murphy might have to weigh into since he was the one who suggested, because otherwise I'd say let's do the meeting on Monday the 28th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1282.844s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Right, I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1284.026s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Which would be far, far preferable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1287.941s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And if you go to July 1st, it's the beginning of the 4th of July weekend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1310.519s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And yeah, so once we get that, I would actually suggest otherwise that we look at Monday the 28th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1316.783s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So let's put a hold on Monday the 28th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1376.814s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I'd have to do a leader's time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1440.511s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I did want to read, I thought I saw him here earlier, so I thought he might chime in, but I do want to read a letter that we received for the committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1451.537s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Dear members of the school committee, I'm writing to express my utmost appreciation and support for Dr. Marice Edouard-Vincent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1458.661s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The courage and grace that she has displayed over the past year is truly remarkable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1463.023s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The city is blessed to have her leading our school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1466.125s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I am sure that the members of this committee feel the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1468.915s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I look forward to many more years with Dr. Edouard-Vincent at the helm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1472.316s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Respectfully, Sean M. Began, Esquire, Zero Governors Ave, Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1478.198s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1479.939s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JcaRW85lvs0&t=1484.421s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3216.871s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's red, is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3218.693s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If it's red, then yep, you're on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3220.194s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so I received three emails regarding the start time of our school committee meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3229.263s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: They were from Eunice Brown of 48 Greenleaf Ave., Rick Orlando from 13 Winford Way,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3238.852s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: and Ron and Janice Martinetti of 126 Lincoln Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3245.016s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Each of the writers asked us to start to resume the original 7 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3249.939s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: start date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3251.76s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor, is it allowable for me to just condense these or do I need to read<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3258.026s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think if they all are the same subject matter, you can give us a general outline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3262.329s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So the request on all of them is to resume the original 7 PM start date for all our school committee meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3269.235s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And part of this is that now that we're back to chambers for people who want to come up in person, it's easier for people to attend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3280.144s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Eunice Brown also asked that any subcommittee meetings also<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3285.153s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: start at this time when a regular meeting does not occur.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3289.855s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So if one was before a meeting, I think that it sounds like she understands that would be at a different time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3296.218s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Anyway, the people spoke to the fact that they want to be able to participate and that the earlier start times makes it difficult for them to do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3310.245s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So that is a summation of those three letters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3321.249s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Can I speak to this for a moment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3329.913s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to explain for people why we also are trying to be deferential to the people who, for employees as well, many of them who start very early in the morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3340.178s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But I didn't speak to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3340.978s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3349.164s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Excuse me, I'm so sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3350.766s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: No problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3352.707s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: No, actually, okay, she said that she did get an answer from administration, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=3357.832s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Dr. Edwards-Vinson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=4760.27s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=4761.731s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=4763.171s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I too would like to just add my thanks and appreciation for all you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=4767.433s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's so exciting each year to get to see what projects the kids are going to take on and it's just so fabulous for our district and just a sense that we're on the cutting edge with this and really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=4782.858s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I would like to ask the superintendent if you would<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=4785.605s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: make sure that a letter goes out from the school committee thanking the Cummings Foundation for their extremely generous gift to the CCSR.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=4792.771s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you guys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=5419.52s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6017.799s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And Mayor, I just also want to congratulate and thank our dynamic duo team, Tanya and Alex for their incredible energy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6029.401s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I really, when I get to attend the meetings, you're great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6034.862s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much for all the work you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=6038.683s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8523.243s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Van de Kloof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8524.54s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I just want to add my word.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8526.441s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This is clearly a very comprehensive plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8529.023s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: As we were, as you were presenting it, I was looking at all the different things that we've talked about this evening and in our other meetings and sort of thinking about which buckets they would go into.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8540.411s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's not that some of those things haven't been already been doing, but the laying it out and saying this is our direction certainly makes it very clear to everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10168.448s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you for your presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10169.749s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That was very, very interesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10172.21s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm sure that you've, since you've worked in different districts and whatever, and you must be familiar with some of the software that's out there for what you're suggesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10185.037s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Do, can you give us an idea of what, when you say, yes, it's expensive, are we talking 500,000?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10191.601s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Are we talking, you know, what ballpark?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10195.783s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Because this clearly is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10197.35s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: not only the school side, but the city side as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10200.652s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I know you don't want to be pegged to a number, but, you know, I'm not sure that I know what your big is or your expensive is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10208.716s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Just trying to get an idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10213.119s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10312.529s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: current practice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=10313.47s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And have you shared with perhaps Mr. Murphy what some of those biggest players are that you would suggest we look at?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12130.898s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If you could just give us some specifics, how many members of the team are you envisioning at this point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12141.306s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So Megan, and then how many?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12270.506s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So tonight, are you asking us to approve the concept without a dollar amount attached?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12334.759s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I make a motion that we move forward with the family engagement<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12342.898s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: proposals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13047.63s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So right now, we are expecting the advisory committee to present on Monday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13053.815s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I thought we were then going to vote after their presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13061.621s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If they don't come to completion of their, I mean, I think it depends what,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13070.507s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: message we send back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13072.008s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If we're saying to them on Monday, we're going to, we'd like you to present whatever you've got, whatever, whatever, however, whatever slideshow they have, wherever they're at, you know, or, or, or we could be more direct and say, we don't need a 30 minute presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13094.325s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We need, you know, I mean, we want to make sure that there's,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13099.917s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: one or two slides about each name, not necessarily eight slides about one and none about the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13107.158s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I do think that the direction back to the committee is yes, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13114.58s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We're extending it to June 14th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13117.641s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We expect on the 14th that we will hear your presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13123.262s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Please at your meetings now go forward with the intent of having at least<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13129.678s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, a slide about each name, not eight slides about each name, but a slide, you know, something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13154.148s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, that's more the only that, that given that there's limited time,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13160.133s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And we'd like a fair amount of slides per.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13162.435s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Right, to give us a concise presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13164.536s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And that if, I mean, if they need to set up their meeting so that they're going to speak, you know, half an hour on this name, half an hour on this name, and, you know, provide structure to them so that they don't get bogged down on the slide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13273.277s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I support this very much because as the person now who's charged with reading the letters or the commentary, the question always is, do I have to read word for word?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13284.005s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: What if there's inappropriate language?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13286.447s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: What if there is, you know, three letters as there was tonight all on the same thing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13292.251s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's difficult to understand exactly what we're supposed to be doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13296.054s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I appreciate that we might develop some guidelines for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13384.386s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: May, just to give a back story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13387.127s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So we received a $30,000 recycling grant and as part of the grant,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13391.247s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It has to be a school committee approved recycling policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13394.188s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So that is a standard policy for the Department of Environmental Protection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13397.169s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I look forward to all supporting it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2750.128s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So, Mr. Murphy, you and I spent considerable time today discussing the issue that my colleague brought up at the top of this meeting with the transportation for the high school students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2762.172s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And really what we come down to, if I'm clear on it, is that no final decision has been made except that you are working towards the fact that the school committee wants to provide transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2772.569s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: One thing I thought about after our discussion was whether students would still be able to buy bus passes if they were so inclined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2821.544s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2822.225s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And just to follow up, during the course of the discussion, I expressed great concern that the Eastern bus projection that we would be able to go down a bus was a terrific surprise to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2838.073s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, it is true that we have less students currently than we did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2842.315s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It is unclear exactly how many students will be returning to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2846.997s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But that is, I just, I think that we need to keep what our budgeting generous in this area because I believe, I just know from the past that all of a sudden we have requests from the woodwork and it's very, very difficult to take back something that you've given before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2865.761s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's a concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2867.402s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: On the bright side, I do wanna mention that there were so many things in this budget which are positives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2872.803s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: For instance, I'll just pick a small one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2875.764s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: In the world languages, we are going to introduce French in the sixth grade level and textbooks for that have been provided for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2884.865s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There's also textbooks in the science area, and I didn't go through all of them, but I don't want members of the public to think that there aren't, in fact, major upgrades in many, many areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2899.341s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: On the other hand, there are some areas which I am a little concerned about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2903.504s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm gonna go back to my fine arts where earlier I had asked many questions about this area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2908.569s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I had been advocating strongly for a supervisor, a director position of fine arts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2916.315s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: After a discussion with the superintendent, it's clear that she's not yet ready to move on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2922.78s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And while I understand that in some ways, in other ways,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2926.958s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I still feel that the area is so critical in that social emotional well-being of life area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2935.93s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So we aren't doing that right now, but I've certainly made it clear that my concerns in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2942.939s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We'll be watching that very carefully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2945.381s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: However, given that that isn't happening, I was a little surprised not to see some of the smaller requests increase inventory of instruments, including ukuleles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2956.49s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I had asked about the number of violins, being that we're going to be starting both<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2961.315s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: potentially two grade levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2964.017s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And some of those things I don't see funded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2967.48s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I wanted to ask about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2969.482s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I also wanted to question, I assume that some of the other things that we talked about for science, I mean, excuse me, for summer enrichment programs are under the TBD sort because that's gonna come from ESSER funding?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=2985.891s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, could you go back and talk about the smaller bylines and fine arts at them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3147.074s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I see there is a line item restoration of supplies and transportation lines to provide for resumption of normal event participation post pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3155.138s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I assume that one perhaps is about transportation for the band.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3163.582s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So that one is in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3164.742s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess one of the things is when I talk about and you mentioned ukuleles, but there's also<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3170.445s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: part of my real concern was the violin and the orchestra program, that while they're small numbers, and I certainly understand you can say, yes, they'll be covered in the course, that there were some of these that are, you know, really germane to the enjoyment of students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3189.533s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think that enjoyment and going to school is, you know, a very important piece of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3194.335s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's why I mentioned them, kind of like the chocolate chips and the pancake.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3253.712s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, one last, just building on a previous issue,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3258.547s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It does under, for example, in the mathematics department, it does set aside 35K in, it says, for a week-long, four-hour-a-day math academy, which we had spoken about, certainly, in the curriculum subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3277.138s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It says COVID mitigation priority, so I'm assuming, again, that means ESSER funds?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3283.242s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3395.827s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: OK, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=3396.787s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And thanks for all the work you've done on the budget, as well as Michelle and the rest of the team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5096.757s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, the school committee received a letter this week from some of our CCSR students asking about our user fees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5105.781s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And this has been something that over the years we've sought to reduce user fees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5111.643s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, it's a fairly substantial number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5114.444s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And perhaps, Mr. Murphy, do you know how much user fees bring in or approximately?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5134.079s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So anyway, this is certainly another concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5137.14s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I know that we have taken great pains to make sure that students who could not afford user fees were in fact waived, yet the students are bringing it before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5150.524s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I realized that at this point now we've set our budget number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5155.805s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We're also clearing that there's going to be some level of,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5161.087s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: change yet in the budget as they normally are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5163.429s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it is something that we should take up again at a school committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5168.992s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I certainly know that for years and years and years, the ideal thought would be that we would waive all user fees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5176.317s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But it's always been a budget impact, just the way the transportation is and everything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5180.119s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So if we can look at it in the future, and again, the students spoke up, I would certainly like to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5188.803s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: hear more from their concerns, because I guess in many ways, I was thinking that we were meeting the needs of students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5197.565s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If we're not, we need to know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5205.886s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5206.687s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd like to make a motion that we accept the budget and put it forward to the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5212.388s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: For $68,221,865, Mia?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5212.728s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5218.939s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qmMnmAGIsyk&t=5287.604s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Tomorrow night, yay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=262.812s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And earlier, it'd be okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=977.429s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Kathy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=980.472s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, first I just want to say thank you for the great presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=984.315s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's great to see all of the projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=986.918s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm particularly excited I have to say I think that that new house and you know the what you've talked about with the kids being able to learn how to do the kitchen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=995.985s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: and how to, you know, cut into the drywall, whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=999.889s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's just fantastic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1001.05s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So really exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1002.211s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I can't wait to see it in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1004.673s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And the outside of the house of the school looks, by the vocational interest, looks so much better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1012.34s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you for, thanks for all you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1481.53s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Can I ask a question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1484.793s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And of course my phone's ringing at this point, but my question is, I've just seen the phenomenal work that our students are doing at the vocational school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1495.442s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm wondering whether there's a way for this project, designing a sign, whether it makes any sense to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1506.251s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: to ask Chad, and I don't know if Chad's still on, you know, is there between our different shops, is this something that, you know, a sign, I know there might be a timeline, so if the desire is expediency, maybe it takes too long, but I just wondered<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1545.433s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: From the lighting perspective or from the installation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1551.535s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm curious what part of the project was the most challenging to you, Chad?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1593.712s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, yes, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1595.633s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you wanna, like, I guess one of the questions is kind of getting a sense from the committee what we think, you mentioned the mayor like number one and four, is it possible to put them up right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1671.658s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1760.745s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't like the white background in the middle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1836.084s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And then it says home of the Mustangs on it underneath.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1879.429s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Not lighted, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1881.649s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But we could shine a light on them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1904.215s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know on this one, the things that I think it's, you've got the horse in two different places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1910.837s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I like the Mustang pride over the door, but maybe if, I mean, if we're gonna use this rendition of the horse, then maybe I would do the etching on the window, but have one of the plainer signs over it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1926.181s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, I don't understand why we would repeat the horse twice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1978.685s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, so I'm not wild about this new logo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=1982.328s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: What I do like, I like, depending, the home of the Mustang's right over the door is, you know, I prefer we stay with our old logo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2033.386s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I disagree with you, Paul, if I may, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2037.009s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Cathy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2037.729s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2038.27s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Van de Kool, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2039.711s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, if we were to reconsider naming the high school at some point, that would be when we did a very large project, if we were going to ever go that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2049.978s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think for this one, the idea was simply to get a sign on at the front signage as soon as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2057.844s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We see, I mean,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2061.42s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Involving the whole community to make a decision about whether they like this sign or that sign to me is similar to sort of involving the whole community and whether we want this paint or that paint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2074.13s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think this is in our purview that we can suggest, you know, we might want to involve all our colleagues or the mayor, whatever, or, you know, but to go further than that, I mean, I don't think this is a community issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2086.734s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think this is coming up with a good design and getting it up over the door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2111.898s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So Paul, we're not renaming the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2114.139s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We're putting a sign with the high school's name on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2127.206s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we could also say that's a can of worms too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2160.249s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So the question will be the cost of what we got as bids surprises me that it's so expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2170.273s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think that's the issue is to say, hey, we like this kind of, this is kind of what we're looking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2175.935s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: How can we do it in a less expensive way?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2180.517s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Can it be done in a less expensive way?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2183.592s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, I look at the letter on the vocational school, and I think it looks pretty good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2192.006s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: How is that done?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2574.217s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Which one's that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2577.506s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2599.722s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Can you do one, two, and three again, Kathy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2618.938s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, wait a minute, where's three?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=2740.738s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: On this one, we can only vote for one, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3042.184s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So the thing about this then is that it's not showing the blue and white colors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3046.965s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's showing the blue and the color of the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3314.462s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: What is the sign made out of?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3405.53s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think at the same time, I think it's worthwhile having a little bit more of a chat, maybe with construction, I mean with carpentry and electrical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3418.995s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: To me, this is the kind of project we can, what letters were done on the vocational school<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3425.597s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think both, I think, Peter, I think it's a great idea to involve the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3430.558s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that doing some pictures around the school saying, which one do you like, you know, and it would be fabulous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3436.72s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I know it's late in the year, but I think that would really be the best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3441.581s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think if there is, you know, a way to see if there's any idea more about how to create the sign without spending that much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3571.822s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There is a question about timing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3574.683s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm not sure we're clear about what the timing should be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3581.246s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Do we want it in place so it's there for the opening of school in September?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3586.768s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Or is it more important to cut costs, include the student body, et cetera?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3599.228s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So, so far what I'm hearing is we want to do a little more exploration and we're not ready to give an okay to a 20,000 plus sign.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3686.915s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, and with the pricing, the pricing may be just the manufacturing of the sign.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3692.356s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know if it included installation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3694.317s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And then the other question is if it included the electrical work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3699.238s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I don't think it did, but I'm not certain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3712.501s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, this is where we really need a company to step up and make a donation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3752.462s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: OK, Kathy, I think it's 6.04 now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3827.833s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=3838.161s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4515.172s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Peter, that's a sweet idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=4524.379s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd like to have us have a horticultural program, but that's a topic for another meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=5440.233s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: No, what do we need now to proceed on this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=5443.114s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: What's our next step?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=5890.505s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=6167.795s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=6171.638s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=6174.7s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0mqfzXKqXM&t=6458.884s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1059.217s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1061.478s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So the meeting was on 510, present was myself, Paul Rousseau, attended in place of Mia.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1071.301s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Jenny Graham was present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1073.002s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Also present was Rachel Perry, Peter Cushing, Suzanne Galussi, Bernardette Riccadeli, Lisa Evangelistic, Joan Bowen, Dr. Marice Edouard-Vincent, Christina Lee, Medford Community Media, Bill Giglio,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1087.712s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: and Maureen Lavin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1090.514s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Rachel Puri discussed health education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1094.177s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She gave us a presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1096.479s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She mentioned that Medford is aligned to national standards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1100.422s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: DESE is editing the 1999 frameworks and will put it out for public opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1106.627s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So because of that, that's why we're right now aligning to the national standards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1111.751s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We use the Michigan model based K to 12.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1115.474s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We spoke about this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1117.286s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: at some length later in the meeting as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1121.63s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: In the elementary, social-emotional is taught by classroom teachers, which begins in kindergarten.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1129.636s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: In third grade, discussions about bullying education begins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1134.681s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And in fifth grade, we have introduction to puberty given by the nursing department using a Proctor and Gamble curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1149.113s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There are pre and post tests provided to assess student learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1153.577s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: In middle school, the students have half a year of health and half a year in guidance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1159.982s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Then we talked about some detail about the curriculum in each of the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1167.028s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And again, that there are pre and post assignments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1170.07s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: At high school health, it's taught by health teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1172.932s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Again, it's half a year of health, half a year of physical education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1177.159s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Freshman year is introduction to health, sophomore year is healthy decision making, junior year is healthy lifestyles, and senior year is transition to adulthood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1192.615s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Rousseau asked whether gender identity was covered in grade six to eight, and Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1198.999s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Perry answered that it was covered briefly in grade six.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1202.201s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: National guidelines on sexuality and gender identity just changed and we're adapting to those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1212.307s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Rousseau followed, said that he was concerned it wasn't presented until senior year, but Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1217.39s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Perry assured us that it's also presented during the freshman year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1221.818s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We also talked about the right language for consent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1224.84s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1225.22s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Perry said that the students are taught appropriate touch guidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1235.565s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Russo said, do we ever talk about sex in a positive way?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1240.247s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1240.567s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Perry said that the age of consent is 16.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1242.929s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So we talk about abstinence to adhere to that guideline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1250.882s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1251.083s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Graham questions about the Michigan model and spoke about her concern that a consumer product video is used to introduce puberty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1264.335s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And there was quite a bit of discussion about this and seeing the hopos that we could see whether there is a better film or introduction that's out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1277.335s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so that's sort of on the table to explore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1282.746s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: In physical education, in each of the grades, really introduction to basic skills and concepts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1290.512s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the things that we talked about the most is what's needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1298.118s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We need to hire a middle school health teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1302.001s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We need an adaptive PE teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1305.524s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We need to provide professional development for sex education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1311.03s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And we need to provide professional development for adaptive physical education for the entire physical education staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1326.138s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We did talk more about the adaptive PE and asked how we're meeting the needs of all of our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1337.536s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1337.736s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Perry said that some students say sub-separate, some go into full class, and we're looking into using something called the flash curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1350.764s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1350.944s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Graham followed and asked more questions about the Michigan model, and Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1355.286s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Perry assured us that it's a skills-based model.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1358.008s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I remembered from our, when we,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1364.195s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: used it when we approved it, there was a great deal of discussion about it at the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1374.1s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Dr. Marice Edouard-Vincent said the Michigan model is definitely one of the most respected skills-based models.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1381.523s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We do need to pay attention to the national standards until DESE updates theirs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1386.217s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Girls are hitting puberty at younger ages, especially children of color.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1390.279s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Research tells us that we need to emphasize healthy eating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1395.661s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Anyway, it was a good evening, and many of the things that we talked about in terms of needs, we've picked up in our budget discussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=1403.465s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=2085.644s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, so Mayor, we did receive a letter from Mr. Giglio in regards to the Columbus School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=2093.991s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We could take it up<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=2096.107s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: later in the agenda when we speak?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=2099.108s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Or do you want to hear it now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=2101.288s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Whatever you think is appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=2112.051s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: OK, if we perhaps did it at the forefront of that, it would be helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=3425.41s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=3427.141s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, Secretary of Schools & Community Relations, COB 22152.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=3431.143s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, Secretary of Schools & Community Relations, COB 22152.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=3597.193s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=3598.034s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I was just curious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=5972.686s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I'd just like to thank both of our principals as well as those who presented last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=5977.887s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's just so great to see some of the creativity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=5980.948s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The desks that look like cars with the shields just absolutely just got it for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=5989.51s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=5990.49s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, there were so many different ideas and creative thinking in those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=5995.751s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, when we're talking sometimes about the issues, it's hard to, you know, understand exactly what's happening in the classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6003.534s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Then you see that and it's just knocks your socks off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6005.855s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you so much to both of you and to all of our principals who've worked so hard this year and to our entire staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6014.218s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6014.638s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Kay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6552.681s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor, are we ready to conclude?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6555.452s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I did get a letter regarding the whole Columbus issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6563.555s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I didn't read it at the front.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6568.917s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This is from Mr. Giglio.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6570.357s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I know he was on earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6572.958s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, he's still on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6575.119s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There's a kind of funny thing about the letters, which now we have this way that people can submit letters, but they're also on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6585.503s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But anyway, I think I need to read it because it was submitted through the proper channels, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6592.169s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It says, dear school committee, with the recent removal of one of the Columbus School renaming committee members due to his social media comments, many Medford residents strongly feel that the process is tainted and flawed due to not only his anti-bias views, but other committee members and their similar social media comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6609.475s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Although this former member no longer sits on the committee, his suggestion that there was widespread cheating as well as his comments made about a particular race and nationality of people who took the time to fill out the response form is absolutely absurd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6621.818s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I would also like to bring up the disturbing fact that the beginning of the last renaming meeting, a letter was read on behalf of the NAACP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6629.64s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I believe, and I could be wrong, that the public was told that there would be no public participation of any kind during these renaming committee meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6636.683s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Not only was the NAACP, who does not sit on the renaming committee letter, but it also mentioned other issues and ideas that were suggested to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6646.58s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: next on the agenda to be pushed through in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6649.802s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I've obtained and read the letter that the NAACP wrote that was addressed to the mayor of Medford and dated March 12th, 2021, which was before the renaming committee was chosen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6662.248s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This leads many people to believe that someone within the school committee or school system had this push through to be read during the meeting on May 12th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6670.032s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Madam mayor and school committee chair, with so many issues that have arisen during this process, which included certain timeline dates,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6676.455s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: made but not kept by the school committee and with the removal of the renaming committee member along with the NAACP letter that suggests changing other rules and policies the Medford community kindly asks that the Columbus school renaming process please cease and be re-evaluated request this Columbus school renaming process be added to the ballot for the November 2021 election<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6699.728s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: to afford a fair process for all residents to have a say in the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6704.273s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Please consider this request respectfully, Bill Giglio, Winthrop Street, Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6710.84s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: 18 year resident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6715.225s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So Mayor, I have, no, if I may continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6720.776s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6721.537s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I would support if the advisory committee needs more time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6727.681s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I certainly would think that we can accommodate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6732.285s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I will tell you that I did eavesdrop on the last meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6736.488s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I saw the committee slugging through the weeds of process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6742.492s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: then I was very appreciative to all of them because that's the kind of hard work, the difficult conversations, the trying to figure out what's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6755.236s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I certainly saw, while I wouldn't necessarily have agreed with every comment that was made, I certainly saw people working with good faith.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6765.438s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I was very appreciative to the advisory committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6768.899s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So my personal belief is that if the committee has asked us for more time, then absolutely in the interest of them going forward, we should accommodate their schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6799.777s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we should hear from other members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6851.614s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Roll call, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6852.675s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Wait, wait, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6854.275s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6855.236s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is June 7th really giving them the time they need?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6869.397s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, the other thing I would just wanted to mention before we do the roll call is we also received a letter from the Columbus Elementary staff, which I know is going to be shared with the committee, the advisory committee at their next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6884.901s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It was a letter really suggesting some other alternatives that perhaps weren't as loaded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6892.022s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I believe I heard Mr. Lister mentioned in a letter back to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6900.264s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Vicki Mello, who sent it on behalf of Columbus teachers, that he was going to read it at their next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6908.247s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I would be very interested in also hearing their opinion on the letter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=6963.837s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Melanie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8326.528s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd actually like to defer to the to miss Cugno and Adam, who so if I could have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8525.395s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8526.816s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I would support sending this to the subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8529.158s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think there's lots of issues involved, including whether we have the personnel, whether we have the systems in place, perhaps we're identifying an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8539.187s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I may be sounding kind of old school, but, you know, I have some concerns about parents talking to their kids all throughout the school day because, and I always saw that, I mean,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8554.316s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: that certainly if there's a concern around transportation or who's going where, whatever, those are communications that do need to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8565.919s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But also, I think there's a lot of questions here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8572.24s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I support it going to the subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8718.675s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, Kathy, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8788.812s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, so Mayor, I do think it's time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8792.675s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: My only concern is that we've just sent the advisory committee to make their presentations on the 7th<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8801.551s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I don't know whether it's more complicated or less complicated for them if all of a sudden we say, oh, well, yeah, we're going to be in the chambers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8810.217s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's something I'm a little uncertain about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8814.08s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we're fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8817.883s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You think you're fine?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8818.943s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8819.984s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So then fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8821.405s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Then I would say that we should return and it should be, you know, it's time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8826.389s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Luckily, it's time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8827.49s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank God it's time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8829.491s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=8830.272s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Ruseau?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9198.158s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I just wanted to mention that I do think in the future, and I don't know exactly what the governor's advisory is going to be, but there also is, there is a plus side to sometimes having Zoom meetings, either weather related or whether you members are, you know, so I'm hoping that as we go forward into this next phase, and as we figure out meetings, that we're both returning to chambers, which will be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9228.278s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: a delight for many of us, but also that since we've now have this capability of doing meetings by Zoom, that sometimes we might opt to do a subcommittee meeting or something by Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=9241.932s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So it'll be interesting as we go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BrSC8V8no0E&t=10102.073s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=157.49s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3068.903s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3069.723s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm going to pick up right at the end about the busing for the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3075.188s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Dave, you've presented us with some interesting options, but with quite big differences in pricing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3087.638s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: At this point, as you're building this budget,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3090.347s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: What are you, are you making a recommendation to us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3095.088s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Are we gonna, I mean, how are you going to factor in the cost into the budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3230.138s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So Dave, let's go back to one of the things you said about the mile radius.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3234.261s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I have to tell you, I really don't recall taking any vote on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3280.253s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I would be, I think it was perfectly understandable that our ridership diminished a great deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3285.217s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I know in Medford, there's been a history of some students receiving bus service because of concerns about the roads where they live, the safety of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3301.67s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So to just say automatically it's a mile, well, it's never been just automatically a mile.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3344.167s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, well, part of it is, you know, perceived safety or it's been in place for such a long time, any move to take away will certainly cause an uproar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3354.75s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So it seems like, I hear you on the optimistic level, we're gonna have some space and so we can utilize an existing bus<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3364.49s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That does sound very optimistic to me, Dave, and I am optimistic in general, but- I'm not so ready to balance each other out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3373.877s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, and at the high end, it's 350, which is a huge chunk of change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3378.44s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And there are some, I'm just trying to say as we, with such a big number, it's hard to understand exactly where you're gonna come down to in terms of what we're putting into the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3403.415s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3403.875s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And the same time, and I appreciate the, uh, my colleagues having raised this issue because it is an issue and it is a, uh, a fairness issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3412.339s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So, um, I think clearly we're going to have to have more conversations on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3416.901s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3417.441s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I yield to someone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5187.407s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5191.429s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5195.111s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6730.945s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6731.865s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to go back and address the subject that was raised by Member Graham, followed up with the mayor's comments and Melanie McLaughlin's on the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6742.534s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-K<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6762.366s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Initially, right after the election and the concerns around the makeup of the committee, then the pandemic stepped in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6773.573s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It is vital that we determine where we're going to go with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6777.638s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Are we going to pick a whole new committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6778.979s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There were people who had expressed interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6782.283s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: At this point, we need to establish a committee because I understand Jenny's concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6788.59s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I also want to make sure that the building is livable for the kids who are there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6793.336s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think there is a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6794.931s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think there is some place in the middle of between absolutely not and doing some of the necessary upgrades to keep the building in a satisfactory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6805.828s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: shape while students are currently using it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6809.269s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But key to that more than anything is we have to determine what the vision committee is going to be, what we're asking them of, and what the timeline we envision is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6821.632s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Maybe it's not the time to start it at the end of June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6823.872s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6825.493s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But we need to be ready to be focused at the beginning of September and not wait for another school year to go by.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6842.173s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, but I think we need to determine, Mayor, we don't need, we can't wait till September to have the discussion about what we're gonna do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6850.019s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: No, no, June, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6862.049s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: No, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6865.148s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I saw the superintendent's hand waving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=7294.87s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=142.779s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I have to say, everybody looks so tired already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=148.361s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's only Thursday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=150.141s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: What?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=150.721s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Who looks tired?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=151.942s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=152.362s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Not you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=157.108s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: All right, one, two, three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=162.212s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Maybe it's just, I'm tired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=321.939s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You're muted, Melanie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=4122.796s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=4123.356s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And thank you to everybody for the nice, concise presentations that we had tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=4128.357s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: My question in terms of the mathematics department was, but this will probably go filter through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=4134.639s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I heard us talk about transportation for afterschool programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=4138.94s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: When we talk about the summer programs, are we envisioning transportation availability for those?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=4144.581s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And are we envisioning all in person or might there be a Zoom<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=4153.583s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Uh portion to four kids who can't come into, uh, the program physically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=7449.115s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UyRSZHmpAdI&t=8089.615s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1573.476s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Councilor Morell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2004.025s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5142.644s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I can't thank you enough for coming down and sharing your personal stories with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5148.665s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I know they mean the world to me because I knew Jean and she was fabulous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5153.546s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And like I said, I never forget the smile and the positive upbeat attitude, which this community could use now more than ever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5160.748s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I just want to thank you for coming tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5162.711s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=9147.606s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Because I am hurt to think of all that Gene Berry did in this school system, in Medford, and some of the rest of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=277.941s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=279.181s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Jenny Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=280.462s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=282.483s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Kathy Kreatz is on her way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=285.605s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Melanie McLaughlin is absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=288.727s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mia Mustone is, I believe, on her way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=293.73s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So absent, Paul Rousseau?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=298.073s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Paulette Van der Kloot is present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=300.818s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And Mayor Lungo-Koehn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=1719.882s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I'll ask for the preference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=1722.023s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I had a question for Dr. Chiesa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=1725.145s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you want to do the whole presentation first, Dave?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=1754.29s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, I'm okay to wait.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=2810.211s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=2811.553s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I could, if I would suggest that we do questions subject by subject, so that all members can ask questions about a particular subject and then we move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=2822.045s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd like to start since Dr. Chiesa was first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=2826.03s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: English language arts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=2828.532s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Nicole, you referenced that in the future we're going to be looking at our reading program journeys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=2834.697s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: As you know, it's been under fire from community members quite a bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=2838.94s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So could you just define when you say does in the future mean next year we're going to be looking at reading or could you just address that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=2984.863s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=2986.544s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thanks for that update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=2987.704s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Just as part of that question, I just wanna know, the community member who spoke the other day at the school committee meeting also mentioned, and she's mentioned this before multiple times, the use of some teachers, and she didn't clarify whether this was an ongoing problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3005.471s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I know she's suggested it in the past, but they were using picture clues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3010.394s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And you've mentioned<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3012.094s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: in our professional development, development on science-based evidence for reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3018.357s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So this little issue about teachers using picture clues, has that kind of now been discussed with the science-based evidence?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3080.255s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And just one quick last one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3082.276s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: When will we find out about the GLEAM grant?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3084.338s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And by the way, thank you all for applying for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3102.352s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That's my anticipation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3112.56s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: All right, so we'll keep our,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=3149.407s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=4630.24s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Just a quick one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=4631.021s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Seary, you mentioned Mozilla and Mozilla especially for science, but it sounded like we weren't moving with that yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=4640.128s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I was unclear why, whether it's just another budget item, expense, how expensive is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=4649.796s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If it seems like it's been so successful in other subject areas, why aren't we putting it forth right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=4668.813s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=4670.073s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I didn't understand that from your presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=4686.825s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=4687.626s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So it will be included for science as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=4690.348s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that correct, Dave?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=4697.195s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=4697.695s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=4698.136s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5218.33s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I wanted to move on, if we could, to music and oral language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5224.061s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I had several questions first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5225.905s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think I'm going to take the music part up first, the fine arts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5231.341s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5232.462s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So my concern is, and we touched upon this in our subcommittee meeting on curriculum, but we've had a whole group of students miss their fourth grade string program and a whole group of students miss their fifth grade string program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5250.589s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And as we all know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5252.094s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This becomes the feeder programs for the upper level high school band and orchestra, which I think are such vital opportunities for our kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5261.078s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm curious about, and I realize this strays slightly from the budget, but there may be budget implications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5267.98s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: How are we going to, so let's take for the group of next year's fifth graders who missed fourth grade strings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5277.015s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Will the violin become a possible alternative for them in the lineup of beginning instruments?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5285.538s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And will we need more instruments for that reason?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5289.945s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I'm trying to figure out how we're going to address that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5295.346s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And then that goes into, then we've also missed a whole group of students who missed their first year of instruments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5303.348s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's crucial for them to have that start if they're going to be in middle school music opportunities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5311.65s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So could you address that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5448.92s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Bernadette, you've really not answered my question, though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5452.561s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If you would, will fifth graders have the opportunity to play violin next year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5497.972s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm just wondering if we might need more violins next year, even if the school district is renting them because all of a sudden we have the kids who are moving from third to fourth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5508.463s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Now I'm working on the assumption that next year we are going to at least be able to offer violin because it's not a woodwind, it's not a blowing instrument.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5517.099s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's why I'm starting there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5519.642s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm saying, you know, there may be fifth graders who didn't get the opportunity in fourth grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5525.306s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Do we have, we've traditionally provided those instruments for the students for a nominal, I think $25 a year fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5532.272s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5533.073s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Some of which is waived.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5534.634s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: do we have the capacity in terms of number of instruments or do we need to think about what are we going to do in order to expand?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5543.617s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Because the goal has to be that in the long run that we're offering kids the opportunity so that we can get over this hump so that we continue our wonderful thriving orchestra which has boasted more than 100 members strong for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5660.753s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5664.935s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So if I can follow up on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5668.177s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So obviously that's a big concern of mine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5671.659s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And also how we look at the fifth grade band instrument program as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5680.044s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I still don't know what we don't necessarily know whether we'll be able to be offering all those instruments as far as I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5688.149s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This is one area where I'm wondering whether a summer program makes any sense at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5692.732s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, you know, just to bolster if depending on what the, what the requirements are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5698.485s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, and, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5701.485s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess it also opens up a bigger question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5704.066s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, Bernadette, I'd wanna be clear that this is with no reflection on the job you've been doing, but you will know that from all my years on the committee, I've been a proponent of the fine arts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5717.491s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And while I'm very mindful and understand that perhaps we're looking at how departmentalized we are, I am concerned that in the fine arts, it's really important<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5730.467s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: for us to have the specialty of musicians and artists overseeing the department and the work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5740.474s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so while Bernadette has stepped in and done the hard work this year, I've always said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5749.8s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: hey, I don't want fine arts to become a second fiddle to all the other departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5755.564s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There was a joke in there, but you know, to all the other departments over time, we need to make sure that our fine arts department is as important as all the other departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5767.311s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I worry about that and I want to know, you know, going forth right now, you're not suggesting a separate director, but the question will be, what will the plan be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=5854.294s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to make sure that we budgetarily have plans as well and to make sure that we have enough resources to cover the needs whether it be an instrument or additional teaching staff or whatever to make up for this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6467.413s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I had a question now, if we're ready to move on to world language?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6474.417s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6476.214s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So my question is, Bernadette, you mentioned that there's a $49,000 line item for the introduction of French in grade six, but it didn't look like, was that inclusive of also money for needed textbooks in French, Italian, and Spanish?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6551.367s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay and the second question is really has to do with something you didn't mention but that is we've now no longer have an Italian program at the elementary level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6564.837s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We really haven't talked too much about what's going to happen there but I'm going to direct the question of saying you know the one thing about the Italian program is it brought in kids horizons in understanding that there are countries that speak a totally different language and use different money and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6581.473s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, all of the different things that go along with learning about a different language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6589.298s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm just wondering how we are going to incorporate that type of learning into our curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6600.124s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, again, because we're doing without it, what are we losing and how are we going to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6608.826s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: make sure that our students have that, you know, without waiting until sixth grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6615.471s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, I've mentioned before, I have a grandson who goes to school in another state, and he's in an intensive French program from kindergarten.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6622.997s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: He speaks French.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6623.757s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: He's in first grade now, and he speaks French.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6626.839s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's amazing, and we're not doing that, but his also understanding of things like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6631.903s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Time zones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6632.804s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: He's in first grade of time zones and of, you know, money and games and all the other things that learn that take place about learning about another country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6641.933s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm kind of curious, and I realized that maybe it hasn't been thought about too much at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6647.719s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Because it's been a tough year, but I'm wondering about that type of learning and how are we going to incorporate it into our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6655.425s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: the lives of our elementary kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6746.747s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6851.097s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Susan, who's going to be teaching the period you just spoke about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6863.586s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And what are we going to call that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6866.228s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Do we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6938.219s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=6938.899s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=7431.25s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Kathy Kreatz?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=7433.231s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Melanie is absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=7434.431s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mia Mustone is absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_ktinY_FSkU&t=7435.791s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Paul Rousseau?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4169.56s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, we met from four to 530 on April 28 that evening we discussed the science curriculum and the fine arts curriculum of particular importance in terms of science was that clearly this year was not a particularly good year for hands on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4190.68s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: learning, but we should be set up for next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4193.481s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The sequence of courses has changed in high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4198.502s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: In ninth grade, we're doing biology and 10th grade chemistry and grade 11 and 12 are electives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4209.025s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: In the FOSS grades K to five, we're on year two of adoption and the overall cost was 285,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4222.182s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: They're in biology in high school at the high school biology, we need to consider adopting a new program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4234.375s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The Pearson Biology 2021 program will cost approximately $47,700 for textbooks and a six-year digital license.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4244.884s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And this is going to be something that we're going to be seeing, hopefully, in our budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4250.509s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This year, we were given a free year because we were unable to complete the pilot in 2020 for reasons we understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4258.176s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The science department is satisfied with how it was going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4262.078s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And there is also a, we are being offered a smaller, slimmer book at no cost, Biology the Core, and it's seen that this book could be used very beneficially for EL and special ed populations because there's less text.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4282.704s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: A new electives committee will start next year and we're going to work on promoting a co-teaching model.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4294.747s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It was overly, I think the most important thing was it was clear that there were significant textbook needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4300.869s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think that we'll be discussing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4305.981s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: In terms of music, of course, there was no singing this year at the elementary level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4314.086s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: However, there were other music lessons that stressed percussive activities and other things as were allowed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4327.333s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the things which we talked a little bit about was that we had, of course, no introduction of the violin program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4334.751s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: or of the band program, violin at fourth grade band at fifth grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4340.675s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We also talked about funding for those programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4344.877s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The violins are offered to students for 20, I think in the fourth grade, all students get the opportunity to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4353.341s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think the cost for the whole year is 25 and there's $25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4355.463s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And there is a way of applying to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4360.75s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: not pay that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4362.431s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: At the fifth grade level, there is no formalized way of providing students instruments who can't afford the rental fees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4371.036s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's always been an informal, the head of the department working to make sure that every kid who really wanted to play had an instrument.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4379.581s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So we might look at that at some point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4382.523s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There is a music program called Quaver that was utilized this year to help with the music program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4389.367s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: because of all the things we couldn't do, and that seems to have gotten very good results.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4395.912s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There is a much longer, of course, copy of the minutes, but I think I'll leave it at this for the time being.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4439.153s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor, this one, the minutes were done, but they weren't put into our folders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4443.554s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So we're asking that that holds till the meeting of May 24th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=4992.277s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We received two letters this week that expressed concerns about comments that were made at a subcommittee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5004.09s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think I need to read those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5008.035s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The first one was received was from Jenny pagan says dear mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5014.237s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm ready to express my concerns about a motion that was passed by school committee member probably so during school subcommittee meeting the other night, school committee member Mr. so motion to prohibit citizens from saying they are lifelong resident, or how many years they have lived in Medford for during school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5030.555s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: during school committee meetings, which are public meetings, if I'm not mistaken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5034.459s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This motion was passed by two other members, Jenny Graham and Melanie McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5038.623s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It is set to go in front of the school committee on the whole on May 10th for a vote, which it is not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5043.128s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But while I understand our city, state and country is changing, I truly worry about the direction we are going in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5048.726s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We are censoring like never before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5050.508s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We are prohibiting what people can say what people can read and what people can watch to prohibit a resident from sitting how many years they have lived somewhere is not only illegal but immoral.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5060.498s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: How can you as a mayor and resident allow this we are seriously teetering on dangerous ground when we allow a school committee in a city of 60,000 people to start dictating what residents are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5071.254s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: and are not allowed to say in a public meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5074.015s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The school committee has done very little this year to address the needs of students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5078.015s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I have seen bickering, crying, and complaining in no actual doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5081.096s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You have a superintendent that brings us national news every time there's a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5084.997s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I watch the news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5085.697s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I do not need a recap of it by Medford superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5088.317s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We need the school committee and superintendent to help our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5091.478s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You have families suing the district to pay for their children to go to other schools that will help them because Medford district does not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5099.493s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just pause to say, of course, these are the views of this writer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5103.136s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I know that suits will cost the city thousands of dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5106.078s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I would know since I've already looked into one for my dyslexic daughter, you have helped one meeting to, you have held one meeting to address the concerns brought forward by the families with dyslexic children in which the high reps of the system came on and praised themselves for early screening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5121.27s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Dessie already made early screening a mandate, but they were right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5124.688s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: quite proud to go on, and I think they had anything to do with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5129.313s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: While it's a step, it intervenes without diagnosing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5132.183s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So while I am truly happy for the struggling reader in kindergarten to get intervention, I guess the dyslexics in fourth, fifth, middle school and high school can just keep on struggling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5141.228s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm tired, I'm scared, and I'm beyond frustrated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5144.37s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: When does it stop?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5145.391s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: When do we start getting back the issue of our children?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5147.752s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We set up committees upon committee to address the 15,000 plus name change of school, but I still cannot get a clear answer of what reading program they're going to give my daughter for dyslexia.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5156.632s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You have parks falling apart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5158.173s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: My daughter was at a basketball clinic today and was covered in dirt because the court is falling apart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5162.615s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Same baseball court the students at the Curtis use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5166.697s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Our city is dividing, our school committee is out of control and our superintendent cares more about social justice in other states than she does with the actual children of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5175.242s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You are the elected mayor, do something please before our city falls further apart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5179.144s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Jenny Lynn Pagan, third generation lifelong Medford resident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5184.392s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The other letter which I received was from Jada Higgins, dear elected school committee members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5189.755s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm ready to express my concerns of a motion put forward by Mr. Rousseau during a school committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5195.219s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I am shocked that a school committee member who is elected by the community now believes he has the right to silence the same community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5201.102s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It is our right to have freedom of speech even if the speech doesn't align with Mr. Rousseau's beliefs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5206.427s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The same line he is trying to stop problem from saying when they call in is written in many elected official speeches in Medford and beyond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5213.573s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't believe people say it because they believe they are more important than someone who has lived here a shorter time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5218.518s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I believe it said because they are proud to be from Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5220.82s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We didn't move here because it was convenient for our commute to work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5224.503s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We stayed here because we love it here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5226.565s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We love the fact that our kids can go to school with their cousins and with our childhood friends' children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5231.429s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We love that if<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5232.674s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We are running late, we can make a call and either a family member or a friend will always be there to pick our kids up from school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5238.496s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We love that our classmates are now the ones protecting this city as police and firefighters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5243.638s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We love it here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5244.478s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: My parents both grew up here and chose to stay and raise their children here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5248.8s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: My brother and I have made the same choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5250.941s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We chose this for the love of our city and the great people who make up this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5255.128s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: With all due respect, Mr. Rousseau, do the job you were elected to do and focus on the children in this community education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5261.411s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Focus on the kids struggling daily with learning disabilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5264.113s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Focus on getting all students back to school safely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5266.974s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Focus on closing the gap between children and stop dividing the cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5270.236s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Focus on creating an environment in the schools where kids can be kids and have fun while learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5274.799s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Focus on finding and writing grants to update MHS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5278.24s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There are so many other areas you could focus on, but silencing this community should never be your focus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5283.323s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Sincerely, Jada Higgins,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5285.064s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: a lifelong resident, mother of three, school-aged children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5289.728s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Those are the two letters I received.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5454.766s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, well, I just want to say that, you know, I wasn't part of that subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5462.028s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I certainly would not support anything that says that a community member can't express how long they lived in Medford or their lifelong residence, or if they just moved in yesterday, because I do believe it's a question of the person who's coming before us has<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5481.334s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The right to speak openly and for many people, they want to express that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5488.646s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I don't know how exactly that conversation all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5493.145s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: went forward, we did not have the transcript of the meetings tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5496.766s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I understand that Mr. Russo is going to relook at that if I'm correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5502.929s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But I don't want to speak for the subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5504.529s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm just expressing my own own personal feeling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5507.43s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I also want to stand up and say thank you to the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5511.612s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We've heard this now reframe a couple of times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5514.533s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: about concerns when she mentions other things, other events that are going on in the world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5520.377s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it's very important that we realize that we are part of the world and the things that the superintendent is talking about, certainly around social justice issues, racism, diversity issues, that those are important to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5537.046s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And that I actually take exception to people who don't feel<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5542.95s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, we are sitting here and listening intently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5548.173s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We give opportunity to the community to speak, but I also certainly want to always be open and hearing our superintendent express her thoughts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5558.52s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That's really, frankly, what we pay her for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=5560.761s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, member Kreatz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=9591.361s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I just had a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=9593.202s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So Paul, I thought if you're asking for a report like this, we're sending it to the superintendent, and she will tell us whether<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=9604.272s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: what the timeline and whether it's doable should be, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=9607.415s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Isn't that according to our policy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=9627.651s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But you put a date in and I thought that the idea was to ask the superintendent<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=9633.66s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: for a reasonable timeline?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=9638.121s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=9659.395s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I certainly support the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=9660.897s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just think in keeping what we're doing is we're asking the two superintendents to say when is a reasonable time for us to get this report back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=9674.933s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'll make a motion that we send it to the superintendent's office so that we can find out when a reasonable time to get the report back is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=9686.936s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it's worthwhile doing for every, you know, to find out the information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=9692.817s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=9984.532s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, we're talking about whether the timeline on the report is feasible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=9992.277s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We're not making a bigger discussion about the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=9997.18s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, are we interested in having the report really is the question I think is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=10003.583s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's what we're talking about right now is are we interested in having a report?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=10007.005s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I've said, yes, I'm interested in having a report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=10010.067s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And then I want it to go to the superintendent, and I want her office to determine when is a reasonable time to get this information to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=10604.172s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If I can ask it in a different way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=10606.973s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Generally, how many kids are referred to special ed a year pre pandemic 2030.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=10625.88s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So, and this year, do you think the number, you know, if we had an idea of what it has been, has the number significantly reduced?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=10638.467s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Or are you, you know, are you getting a lot of referrals into your office?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=10643.09s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you think you're getting more referrals this year than ever before?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=10678.377s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So, again, I think my colleagues intent, I think, and you can correct me Paul if I'm wrong, is just to make sure that there are kids who aren't being overlooked because they've been on zoom rather than in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=10698.354s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, and so I think that's, if that's what we're looking for, is the, uh, comparative data, which he suggests, is that the way to go about it or is there a better way, um, for us to, to figure it out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=10712.044s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And how do we make sure under these circumstances that we're not overlooking kids?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=11296.709s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So, I think, two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=11298.33s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: First of all, I think that we need to ask the administration to advise us when what sort of report, and when.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=11308.946s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: it would be available to get at some of these issues that Paul is raising or is concerned about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=11318.93s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I do wanna remind my colleague that just tonight we did hear that the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education thought we were doing really good job and that there is, I guess I do have a sense of,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=11334.337s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: some level of trust in our special education staff that they are following up, that they are, that our teachers are very much, whether a child is on Zoom or in person, that they are on top of it, so to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=11354.564s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So in order to move this discussion along, I think that we should just simply ask<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=11362.386s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: our superintendent's office and whatever, to consider what the issues that my colleague has raised, because he's got some concern and I understand it, to make sure that we are not inappropriately budgeting in the future, and making sure that if there is a wave of upcoming students or if we're really off, if the numbers really don't make sense,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=11390.023s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: that they get back to us and give us an idea of what they think makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=11395.539s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That's what I would advise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=11399.361s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So Paul's got a motion on it on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=11404.124s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I would amend it and ask that the superintendent's office come back to us with their suggestion for a report which would look at data and answer some of the concerns that my colleague has.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=11426.536s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But I'd like to hear from them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-Ad9b17iUII&t=11439.922s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I haven't said by June, but discuss what data they can give us and what suggestions they have for reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=17.611s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I saw his name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=23.152s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There he is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=24.092s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: He's here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=25.372s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=25.612s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I am here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2515.434s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2515.774s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Van de Kloop?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2519.536s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2520.496s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to ask a quick question about the Curtis Tufts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2523.558s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Could you tell me what the current population of the school is right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2528.861s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And also, were there some students, did all students start coming in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2535.924s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Or do we have any fully remote students at the Curtis Tufts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2559.946s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So do the Curtis Tufts teachers, are they interacting with those students specifically?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2586.205s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Next question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2586.865s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You mentioned the program, Boston Recovery Program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2591.868s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: In what ways would that differ from, say, a student going to the Curtis Tufts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2619.56s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, it falls within, I mean, I think it's great that we're building something in because certainly one of the biggest problems in this realm is that we don't usually get to build stuff into our budget, it seems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2633.47s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And then all of a sudden somebody moves into the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2636.292s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I think that that's a very positive move, but I just wanted to make the distinction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=2641.817s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4166.722s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4167.823s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: First I wanted to mention that it happens to be National Nurses Day today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4172.825s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So Tony I wanted to bring that and say particularly to our all of our nursing staff who's done such a tremendous job this year but to you in particular as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4182.831s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And, you know, we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4185.332s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We really haven't given you all the senior praises yet, but we will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4190.116s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's very sad to know that you are retiring, but boy, what a way to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4196.141s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Tony, you certainly pulled out all the stops this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4206.149s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4207.21s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to ask you a little bit more about the four additional people you've<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4213.175s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: recommend it in terms of tracking the COVID and for next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4219.481s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: What exactly, could you expand on the role, I mean that's a, you know, four more nurses,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4227.559s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Could you speak to it a little bit more?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4305.885s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Right, so the difficult part with that is that, you know, please God, when this passes, you know, at which point we've now hired in,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4315.38s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, a team of four people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4317.681s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And then we're just sort of saying, you know, I'm trying to figure out how that works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4345.34s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cg01zn2P9mU&t=4346.92s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Tony.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=2413.443s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=2414.083s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I had a question regarding the paraprofessionals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=2416.826s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I wasn't quite sure whether the request was paraprofessionals at every grade level for every school, i.e.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=2426.093s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: 20-something paraprofessionals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=2429.796s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Could you clarify, please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=2584.671s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I have more questions, but I think we should rotate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5573.05s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5573.55s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: As I'm listening to this discussion, I can't help but feel the word that Suzanne just used was opportunities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5581.837s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And there is here an incredible opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5585.14s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Part of it will depend on how we structure it and how creative we can be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5592.606s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: in terms of meeting the needs of our kids, but also providing that sort of what Paul suggests, extra outside time, extra time where social and emotional needs are met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5605.53s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's really very interesting just to think about as this conversation has taken a place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5611.392s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, of course, that's gone a little bit far from the budget, but it's been worthwhile to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5616.374s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Listen into to think about going back to the budget, I just really many of my colleagues asked questions that I already had on my list, but I just wanted to be clear if before you were on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5629.439s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: For example, it happened to be the Columbus School, but there were other things listed, like replacing outdated Chromebooks so that we could maintain the pandemic purchases, or replacement tiles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5642.049s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I assume that we'll be discussing things like that in the particular, under different parts of the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5749.695s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, so and also to follow up and I realized that Principal Kaye has been very detailed here, but she did mention in her pages replacement of walkie talkies for the TLP program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5774.91s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, Chris, I would certainly be concerned that if there were broken equipment for that particular need, that it would not wait for next year, but it would, in fact, we would find a way to do it this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5858.389s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I very much appreciate the coordinated presentation at the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5864.012s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There's just some of these details and it's actually quite good to hear that, yes, that's taken care of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5868.935s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, that's taken care of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5869.955s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I appreciate both.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=5874.898s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I see that Principal Kaye has her hand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_C3Q_KGMQA&t=6837.378s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mia has a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=0.111s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: From my fellow school committee members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=10.735s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Hi, Susie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=42.102s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Say that again, Paul?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=44.663s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yep, I saw you and now I see Jenny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=46.623s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So with the three of us here, I'm gonna go ahead and start the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=53.804s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If we could all rise to say the Pledge of Allegiance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=58.945s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=70.355s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=72.196s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm gonna take the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=74.076s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=77.397s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=79.898s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Mustone is unable to attend, but Member Ruseau is attending in her absence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=91.882s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=95.824s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And now I'm going to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=97.98s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Read the paragraph.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=99.321s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You would think at this point, we really should have taped it or something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=102.784s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We should have thought about something more clever, but I don't think any of us ever perceived we'd be reading it this long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=108.968s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Anyway, meeting date, May 31st, 5 to no later than 6.30.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=202.938s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=212.648s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And having said all of that, the agenda is we will review the health education and physical education curricula.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=227.275s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That's a long title, Rachel, but Rachel Perry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=230.636s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So Rachel, I know that you have a presentation for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=235.078s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Which area are we going to discuss first?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2405.595s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Rachel, hold on a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2407.875s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just thought before we move on, it might be useful to take some questions regarding the health education piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2468.735s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so are there questions at this time on the health education?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2473.397s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: What's the preference?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2475.798s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Jenny, what would you prefer to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2477.618s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you wanna move on or do you wanna?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2485.161s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, we'll watch the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2487.942s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's 5.41.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2488.942s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Let's do this like in 10 minutes or so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2492.263s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so Paul, I see your hand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2822.762s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2822.862s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Jenny, do you have any questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2973.485s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Rachel can we, um, is that something that you can send us the videos.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2981.675s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Perhaps you could share it with, with, with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2985.58s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So we could see how they're handled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2988.904s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And is that something you're.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=2991.479s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: that comes under, I mean, nursing, I heard you mention Tony.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3011.316s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, Susie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3015.719s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Susie, I see your hand up, Susanne.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3064.122s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It certainly would be interesting to see if there is a video which, in fact, addresses all of these questions to the kids at once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3072.107s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, we have come a long way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3074.468s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I would say that it would make sense for us to look into that right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3081.712s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Paul?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3126.666s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I wanted to ask one question about there used to be a unit on dating violence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3132.871s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I remember an outside group coming in and make a presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3135.573s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Does that still?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3151.798s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3153.039s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so I think at this point, it makes sense for us to move on to the physical education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3159.162s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And then at the end, if anybody has thought of more questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3161.403s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And if we have time, we can come back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3163.724s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So if you'd be so kind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3166.025s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I promise this one will be quicker.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3762.079s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3762.44s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Rachel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3763.601s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Rachel, I'm going to start off the questioning this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3766.405s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You did on the last slide hit the most important questions for me right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3772.615s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The adaptive PE, to what level are we offering and meeting the needs of special education students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3778.543s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: for instance, autistic students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3780.985s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And you mentioned the flash curriculum, is it good for special ed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3784.447s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But as we were going through all the class levels, that was exactly what I was curious about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3789.469s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: For example, if we have a substantially separate high school class that's held at the high school, are those students receiving health education and how is it modified appropriately?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3833.773s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And is that then an outside curriculum?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3842.236s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's free?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3843.056s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3843.636s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Music to my ears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3844.857s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3845.597s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I thought that would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3848.178s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is there a way?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3849.298s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Could you send us a link for that so we could see that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3851.939s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3852.939s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3855.14s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So to Jenny or Paul in particular, what questions might you have for Rachel?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3965.263s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So Jenny, in the past, in prior years, this was a deep conversation as we were looking at our curriculum and seeing it was not adequate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3979.849s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so there was much discussion about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3984.41s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: looking at our curriculum and looking at the Michigan model, which sort of rose like the cream to the top and talking about that, getting feedback from our principals and from our teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=3998.319s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It was, I would say that it was, you know, it's always important to review curriculum and to make sure they're still meeting our needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4006.524s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But I do want to say that this was something that was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4010.807s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know if that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4011.387s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thoroughly talked about on the school committee level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4315.032s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4316.233s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Are there any other questions for Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4318.335s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Perry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4320.645s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Rachel, Paul, no, Jenny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4325.486s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4326.926s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4327.566s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4327.967s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you so much, Rachel, and thank you everybody else for attending who's here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4331.607s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4333.868s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And we have a meeting, school committee meeting starting at, what time is it starting, six o'clock?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4344.19s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Seven o'clock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4346.224s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4346.625s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So we'll see you all at seven o'clock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4348.208s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4348.709s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4349.29s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4350.032s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4351.214s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4353.679s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Paul Russo?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4356.325s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Jenny Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4357.207s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4358.008s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Paulette VanderKloop?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AtnH2HGG3A4&t=4358.73s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=1.268s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She did email the team, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4.17s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4.61s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I just didn't see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=6.431s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I've not been looking at my phone for that reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=20.62s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Right, because he might be particularly interested in this one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=22.881s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Jenny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=23.922s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=26.368s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So let's see here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=28.89s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Everybody else who needs to be here is here though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=135.782s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Our agenda today is that we're going to begin with a review<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=154.892s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, today we're discussing both the science curriculum and the curriculum Fine Arts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=159.679s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I don't know, perhaps Superintendent, would you like to start us off?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2306.678s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2307.058s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Whoops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2309.18s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2312.704s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, maybe we could stop screens sharing right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2319.59s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And in the meantime, I'm just going to ask my committee members to do a housekeeping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2324.795s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We did not take the role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2326.676s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So if I could just call attendance, Jenny Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2331.16s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2332.42s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mia is unable to come, so she's absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2335.842s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And Paul Russo is here sitting in her place for as long as he can stay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2343.905s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2346.906s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2348.026s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, Paul, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2701.247s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I actually had a question, Maurice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2704.089s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2705.35s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I can email you on some of the follow-ups, but I'm surprised that you said the demand for AP environmental is low.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2713.194s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you poll the kids periodically?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2715.096s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: How do you know it's low?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2741.671s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I'm just thinking that a student might even know, how would a student know that it's potential?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2782.244s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so in the interest of time, I'll just say it was very clear that there's substantial textbook needs in a variety of not only the ninth grade biology, but which I was very happy to hear that there was a supplement that would be good for our special populations, but also across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2802.1s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I guess unless there's any other thing pressing from Paul or Jenny,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2807.202s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We should move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2808.462s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Jenny?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2821.726s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2822.046s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you for attending, Paul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2824.367s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2825.287s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Dr. Riccadeli, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=2827.688s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Rocco.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4428.699s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So let me start off with one Bernadette typically in the music program we start our fifth graders with violin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4436.882s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Can you tell us what What ability did we have to start kids on violin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4442.104s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, I can't this year and also<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4446.808s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: beginning instruments in the sixth grade?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4448.669s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And what impact is that going to have on our future band and orchestra programs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4487.344s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So did fifth graders start violins at all or no?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4559.66s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So in other words, we are hoping that we will be able to provide some opportunities for the kids who missed out, if you would, in the fourth and fifth grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4595.924s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Right, because right now you're gonna have in essence two years of beginning strings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4599.965s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4601.733s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I know that we've always kept some instruments aside or some violins for students who can't afford it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4609.119s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think as the committee as a whole has been addressing some of the needs of transportation throughout the city, the rental program becomes a question too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4619.288s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I think I don't expect you to have all the answers for this right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4623.392s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I certainly know that there was Mr. Zigny in the past had done everything he can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4628.738s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: to provide instruments to students who wanted to continue but couldn't necessarily afford it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4635.28s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But I think, you know, I'd really like you to be looking at that question saying, you know, are we able to provide students with the instruments so that we're not losing students who might be talented musicians, but simply because they can't afford it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4652.329s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Also, next question, just one more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4655.811s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The Quaver Ed that you mentioned, is that a series of lessons?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4659.892s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Or I went online as you were speaking to take a look, but I just wanted to know what we were using it for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4693.788s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So you think it's $7,000 for K-8?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4694.708s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So it is a K-8 program, however,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4736.892s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4748.083s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4749.225s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Jenny, do you have some questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4820.175s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But it's a supplement, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4824.119s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so a teacher would use it now and then, not every lesson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=4882.791s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, we'll have to look it up to learn more about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5157.451s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: My personal experience has been that it's,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5162.109s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: been something that if anybody knew of a student and it was brought to Mr. Zigney's attention, magically it happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5172.116s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So it's been an informal rather than a formal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5175.278s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't think kids were cut out, but it was never formalized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5181.122s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So, okay, it is 529.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5187.847s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Jenny, do you have any more questions that you can do in 30 seconds?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5191.889s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Nope, that was my last question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5193.009s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5193.509s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you want to make it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5194.39s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5196.691s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I appreciate you being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5198.712s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5199.592s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Jenny?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5200.372s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5200.992s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll let, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5201.953s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5202.653s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Right under the wire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5204.094s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Jenny and Superintendent, and if Susie is still on, just if you guys could stay on for a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5211.677s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5212.457s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, just so we can talk about the next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5220.92s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is Susie still here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5222.521s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yep, I'm right here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5223.661s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OUqwVVt47Q&t=5224.762s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So Jenny, just while you're here, so at least there's two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4cMMuLS1xd0&t=824.364s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd rather do it the other way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4cMMuLS1xd0&t=830.189s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4cMMuLS1xd0&t=867.322s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Beth Fuller.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4cMMuLS1xd0&t=926.415s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: In Superintendent, you didn't make my announcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4cMMuLS1xd0&t=1278.495s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4cMMuLS1xd0&t=1280.658s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd like to make a comment, if you would.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4cMMuLS1xd0&t=1282.939s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: First, I want to thank everybody who put their name in, and I want to tell you it was very, very difficult to decide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4cMMuLS1xd0&t=1289.263s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Part of what I was looking at in my, you know, just quickly, was also determining number of men and number of women, and was it<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4cMMuLS1xd0&t=1297.268s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, did what sort of names to be seen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4cMMuLS1xd0&t=1301.009s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But it was very difficult to decide because there was people wrote passionately, people brought different skills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4cMMuLS1xd0&t=1308.172s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I wanted to include them all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4cMMuLS1xd0&t=1310.132s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I really wanted just to thank the members of the public who took the step and put their names in for our consideration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4cMMuLS1xd0&t=1318.795s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4cMMuLS1xd0&t=1320.336s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And just because you weren't selected, doesn't mean that you didn't have an awful lot of value to bring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4cMMuLS1xd0&t=1325.7s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Because there were a lot of people left on my list who I would have loved to have included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4cMMuLS1xd0&t=1474.928s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=170.059s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Hmm, Paul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=250.581s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Motion of approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=384.085s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=386.706s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I do agree that sometimes I think we would benefit by having some rotation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=393.007s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Like a member might ask two questions and then we might go on to a next member rather than just having one member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=400.65s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it might be more engaging for all of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=405.371s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The other thing is I just bring up very diplomatically of saying our last meeting was six hours long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=413.906s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We had something like 23 meetings in the in March.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=418.451s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think what we are inadvertently doing is taking over some of the roles sometimes of the people who we respect and.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=430.922s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: of doing their job and we need to allow them to do their job and not take up so much of their time with our meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=437.863s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I don't quite know how to, there's no way to legislate it, but I think we need to be very conscious as we get now to this last part of the year about how many, what our expectations are about additional meetings and the length of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=663.519s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I will take the vice chair, member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=698.888s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I would suggest that we at least try, and when the mayor comes back, we'll talk to her about doing a rotation for questions to see how that works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=709.755s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Maybe a question, and if there's a follow-up point, that would be understandable, but not a whole new question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=717.32s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So do I see consensus just with a shake of your head, or is everybody willing to try that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=724.024s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Great, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=729.296s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Can we move on to the next order of business?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=731.878s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I don't... Superintendent, can you tell us what it is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=737.602s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Because I don't have it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=741.945s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We can't hear you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=772.307s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: while you're looking for that, Mayor, what we decided was that we would ask you to, that we would rotate questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=781.451s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Perhaps a member would do their question and there might be a potential follow-up to that question, but not a new question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=786.893s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And we would go through members and we'd like to try that out and see how that works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=792.936s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Sounds great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=794.937s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And Melanie is going to give her report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1074.731s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I have one email submitted by William Giglio from Winthrop Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1082.972s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This is to your school committee members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1084.453s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This is a short but two-part email request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1087.501s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: One, with all due respect and after talking with many other Medford families who tune in to watch Medford Public School Committee meetings, we kindly ask that any and all subjects that do not pertain directly to Medford Public Schools, please be refrained from being discussed during the time of the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1102.926s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We as parents tune in each meeting to keep up and stay in touch with what is going on within our school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1108.748s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And we do not need updates on news stories that are going on within our nation that do not directly affect this school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1117.202s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Example, at the last meeting, the news of a 20-year-old man in Minneapolis who was shot by police when trying to flee while being arrested was discussed when this had nothing at all to do with the Medford public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1127.804s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There are many other city community meetings and other outlets that have the time and place for these types of discussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1133.666s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Two, I also kindly request that at the beginning of each Medford school committee meeting, when reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, that a flag be present behind or in view of at least one committee member during the time<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1145.04s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: that meetings are conducted on Zoom and not in city hall chambers where flag is present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=1150.765s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3361.605s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3362.765s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Just this is kind of a housekeeping comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3366.807s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Because of the change in the budget meetings, the curriculum subcommittee meeting is going to be this Wednesday from 4 to 5.30.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3374.99s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We're going to be discussing the science curriculum as well as the fine arts curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3379.932s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Additionally, and I particularly want to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3384.024s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: highlight this to my co-members, Jenny and Mia on the curriculum subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3392.266s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We'd like to set up another one for May 4th, Tuesday, May 4th, also from four to 5.30 to discuss health and PE.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3401.908s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And that would take away the May 13th meeting and give us the opportunity to hear from those departments prior to the instructional portion of the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3413.611s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So after the meeting, if Jenny and Mia would let me know whether that Tuesday, May 4th date is acceptable and whether they can attend, I'd be most appreciative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=3423.359s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6672.277s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, let's see, member Rousseau, and then I'd like to get, we do have a hand raised by Leticia Rocha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6679.302s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So member Rousseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6880.58s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, may I call on Leticia Roca, please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6885.448s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Leticia, are you there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6887.011s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Can you unmute yourself?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=6894.162s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7035.826s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7036.186s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I see the mayor is back, so I'll hand the reins back to the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7041.647s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You need to unmute yourself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7049.788s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We were discussing the transportation for high school students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7061.73s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, Melanie would be next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7063.891s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7486.044s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I had some questions about, first of all, there's a timeline September 1st for comprehensive lists and current job description.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7494.826s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I just wanted to understand whether that was realistic given all the demands of going in right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7504.588s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I was just curious about that from central administration, what their reaction to that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7510.189s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm a little concerned, I find this,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7513.738s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: in many ways pretty confusing and very prescriptive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7523.486s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm sort of wondering if there's a way we can simplify it to make it more accessible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7700.569s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, let me see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=7701.63s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I was going to say Kathy's had her hand raised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8042.925s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Van der Kloot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8044.765s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, and I would second that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8046.486s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm also just gonna throw out one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8049.867s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So, you know, I just, the terminology, professional staff, what, the rest of our staff is unprofessional?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8058.988s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There may be no way around it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8060.389s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It may just be the common thing, but I'm just going to mention it to say to me, it just sounds so funny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6kKbcFkpEqA&t=8522.861s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8155.645s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor, there are two letters that we received.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8158.547s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: One is regarding the mathematics curriculum, which makes sense to read just prior to Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8165.011s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Khan's presentation this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8167.032s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And the other one is regards to the afterschool program, and it makes sense to read that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8172.676s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The parents specifically asked to read that at the outset of the presentation, as they had questions incorporated in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8180.36s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So if I could hold those two to them, that makes the most sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8190.948s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, sorry, I was doing an undersecretary's report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8196.833s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I was like, what's going on here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8200.858s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, sorry about that, Melanie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8203.06s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We'll just let you get over with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8224.565s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: 2021.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8225.585s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So on March 10, 2021, we had a Curriculum Subcommittee meeting that was to be attended by myself, Member Graham, Member Mustone, the Superintendent, Dr. Nicole Chiesa, and Dr. Chiesa gave a PowerPoint presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8244.972s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, if you recall, at our last school committee meeting, I asked for this to be held because the PowerPoint presentation was not incorporated into the minutes, and now it is incorporated into the minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8256.338s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: At the meeting, the first thing we reviewed was state expectations, and then we looked at Medford Public Schools, the district curriculum, professional development, and resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8268.846s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: equity in English language arts and goals and next steps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8276.197s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We talked about the early literacy screeners and, again, the district professional development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8284.044s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There was quite a list that was given and provided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8287.988s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The Hill for Literacy, Crafting Minds, Dr. Nadine Gabb, Lexia training, Lexia Core 5 training, et cetera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8299.165s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We also talked about the Medford Early Literacy Screener.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8303.247s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The Alexia Rapid is given at the Brooks, McGlynn, and Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8307.629s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And the NWEA Map Growth is given at the Columbus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8313.351s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There was, of course, some concern about evidence-based instruction and discussion about journeys not being evidence-based.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8324.056s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: and the bringing in of ECRI.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8326.717s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Some parents had concerns that it is not complete enough and are not supportive and evidence-based.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8336.144s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There was also a question by member Graham<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8340.267s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: who spoke to the fact that there had been a request for a handwriting curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8346.409s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That did not go forward last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8350.35s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not quite sure whether it was only because of COVID or also because of funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8357.433s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's something that's still on the docket.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8364.384s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There was discussion about the curriculum being more reflective of different cultivating additional programs to support the science of reading, including, but not limited to, ECRI, which is Enhanced Core Reading Instruction, Lexia Learning, and NEWS-ELA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8396.489s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There was also, Dr. Chiesa provided for us a list of price points for various different supports and how much they cost the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8413.177s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The one other thing I just wanted to mention, oh, was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8417.647s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Equity in ELA, there's been the addition of numerous novels and informational texts by diverse authors, creating an inclusive classroom, inclusion and pacing guides,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8429.824s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: and also an edition of News ELA, Exploring Identity and Culture, Mirrors and Windows Collection, A Mile in Our Shoes Collection, and Black Students Matter Collection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8444.076s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There is another curriculum meeting this Wednesday at four o'clock, and we hope that you can join us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8492.408s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, the problem is we're covering so much in the meeting as it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8496.112s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that while we touched on, you know, resources being included, we haven't had specific, more in-depth conversations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8508.243s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We have another meeting this Wednesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8510.325s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's covering two subject areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8513.688s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, we're gonna have to go back and I know we had a follow up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8518.211s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I wasn't thinking it was in the curriculum, Melanie, about the special education resources, but we certainly could do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8527.977s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Why don't we talk and we'll figure out how to go forward on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8710.646s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8711.646s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think Dr.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8715.998s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But at this point, no curriculum has been chosen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8727.643s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8731.945s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we have to hold that question right now, and we'll do a follow up on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=8737.988s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, there's Dr. Marisa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=9425.975s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=9666.945s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, this was a follow-up, a second night of discussion from the strategic plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=9672.967s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Again, we divided it up into elementary, middle, high school and special education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=9678.049s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Unfortunately on this night, there were no special education parents and no high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=9682.21s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So we went down to the younger levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=9686.051s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that one, a couple of comments that I just, one member said they thought<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=9691.666s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: that it was passive rather than active.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=9694.368s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I thought that was important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=9696.529s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There was some discussion of what's the difference between a mission and a vision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=9700.452s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And since one of the parents suggested that perhaps as a part of this or the totality, we liked the idea of a short memorable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=9714.742s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And one parent suggested preparing our students to change the world for the better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=9719.919s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I thought that was kind of a neat vision statement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=9722.862s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There was a question of how would we have follow-up and how would that we know parents wanted to make sure that they were part of the follow-up as this was, as we spent more time on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=9738.2s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=10161.828s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Russo, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=10168.83s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So in truth, the night that I was there, I was also, I guess, confused because the truth of the matter is that it is the vice chair who's reading those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=10177.512s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's not accurate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=10179.712s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The big question is, so we have to take that piece out of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=10184.433s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: is whether the secretary believes, and we can ask our current secretary, whether she wants to be put on in the position of every meeting being asked if there's a separate report from the secretary, or whether that is just something a holdover from a prior time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=10200.075s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, I do know earlier when member Kreatz held the position, she approached it in a very certain way, which was great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=10209.201s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But the different folks have different feelings about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=10214.565s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So the reason, I just wondered what you thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=10719.525s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Van der Kloot, you said there's only- There's two, and one is in relation to the math curriculum, and the other is relation to the afterschool program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=10729.187s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I thought I might read them at the beginning of each of those sections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12311.647s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12314.57s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm so I do have a letter from the public regarding the math curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12318.752s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know whether I would actually ask Pfizer, whether I should read it at the beginning or at the end of her presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12352.891s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think just because we've...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12355.072s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: the person submitted it appropriately, we should read it very quickly, and then hopefully you'll hit the points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12362.474s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12363.034s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That'd be perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12365.854s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Kahn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12366.194s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Dear members of the school committee, I have some questions for Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12368.715s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Kahn about the report on the math curriculum and would appreciate if this letter was read then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12373.336s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: One, have the programs that the elementary schools can possibly pilot been narrowed yet, or is that part of what the committee is going to decide?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12381.097s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: What are the programs that are still in consideration?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12383.778s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Two,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12384.65s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: What is the plan for the current middle schoolers for the 21-22 school year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12388.473s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Will the seventh or eighth graders have an accelerated class?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12391.435s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Or are we planning on definitely choosing one of the high school acceleration options?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12396.278s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Three, if the advanced pathways chosen that begins, if the advanced pathways chosen that begins in ninth grade, figure four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12409.028s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: A, how are the enhanced classes different from the regular classes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12412.784s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: How much from pre-calculus needs to be pushed into these enhanced classes for students to be ready for calculus?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12418.447s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Could these topics be covered in the regular classes for all students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12422.069s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: B, what are the pathways for late bloomers in math to get into the advanced pathway and for students who decide to switch out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12429.333s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: C, could there be another option where all students take algebra, geometry, algebra two, and then senior year when students have a better idea of what they want to do after graduation, they split into an enhanced calculus or take one of the other math options?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12443.804s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This is very focused on the advanced students, but what are we going to do to close the achievement gap, especially from the events of the last year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12451.75s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: How can we close the gap without relying heavily on summer school, excessive afterschool tutoring, excessive homework, or keeping students back?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12458.495s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12459.236s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Submitted by Michelle Chiccolo, 28 Douglas Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12464.62s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=12465.161s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=13241.654s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Fiza?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=13242.734s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, Paulette?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=13244.836s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=13245.016s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Khan, will you be able to post your entire presentation perhaps on the school website so that people can see it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=13255.287s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, that would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=13752.329s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Paul has his hand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=13754.77s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, sorry, I couldn't see him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=14357.344s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=14360.328s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member van der Kolk?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=14361.409s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I wanted to, we received another letter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=14364.311s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=14365.272s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It says, dear members of the school committee and Mayor Lungo-Koehn, I am watching the school committee meeting on the public access station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=14372.317s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I am watching the math presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=14374.018s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The question that has not been answered is what about this year's seventh grade students who were not given the option to accelerate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=14380.903s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I thought they would be given the option in eighth grade, but based on this presentation, it does not sound as though any option is being offered that will address them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=14388.641s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I would appreciate if someone would ask this question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=14391.243s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Sincerely, Juliet Gainsborough, parent of a seventh grader and a 10th grader, 115 Alston Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=14423.854s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=14468.662s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor, I received a letter which specifically asked me to read it at the outset, if I could, on this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=14478.265s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Please do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=14478.725s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=14479.958s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Dear school committee members, I, Teresa Fernald from 13 Whittier Road, Medford, am submitting this request and a question on behalf of almost 40 families who have joined together in support of the expansion and further development of accessible, equitable, and inclusive afterschool care in Medford, Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=14496.425s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We request that I be granted five minutes instead of three during the afterschool topic, agenda 9.4, and that the below questions be read aloud during the meeting prior to our five minutes for this agenda item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=14508.763s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Medford parents for better after and before school care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=14512.744s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We have built a network of approximately 40 families who are ready, willing, and eager to be part of identifying and executing solutions related to the afterschool crisis in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=14522.085s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: To build the MPS school committee mission round tables to build off of, I'm sorry, held April 5 and 6, we know the current mission statement is changing and we support this change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=14534.247s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: However, we would like to ask the following as it relates to the mission,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=14537.526s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: calling for MPS to be a partnership of school, family, and community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=14541.75s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: What is the best way for parents to get involved in brainstorming and execution of solutions for the city's afterschool crisis?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=14548.816s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Beyond attending a school committee meeting, how do we start a conversation towards solving the afterschool crisis that builds toward a true partnership between parents, school, and city leadership, in addition to the larger community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=14562.148s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Parents Working for a Better MPS Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=14566.272s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And there's Andrea Quinn and Emily Parada, Christina Roberts, Dallas Scott and Haskell Kent, Daniel Blackwell, Deirdre Hausler, Emily Jameson and Dennis Anderson, Nicole Dillon, Teresa Pernald and Vanessa Forsner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=14581.607s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17137.272s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17139.454s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, thank you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17141.516s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So the thing is, first I want to thank Megan and Fiddler Carey and David Murphy and Suzanne Galussi and everybody else who's worked on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17151.463s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And certainly there are a lot of positive changes in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17157.408s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It looks<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17160.01s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, the increased wages hopefully will help in securing people who want to work in the afterschool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17167.161s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's always been a difficult position to hire because it's for a limited amount of time in sort of an awkward part of the day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17175.513s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I will tell you that I've visited the afterschool on numerous occasions, and I've just been so thrilled with the staff members and their dedication to the kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17186.306s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: They clearly take their responsibilities very highly, and I've heard such wonderful feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17194.748s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Having said all the positives, the only thing is if I'm looking at this and it was from the first slide with the numbers, we're adding projected 60 spaces, but we've got 144 on the wait list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17207.161s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That means if I understood this correctly, there were still 84 families who are being disenfranchised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17213.408s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so then the question comes back and saying,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17216.492s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, great, fantastic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17218.753s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I understand you're trying to be realistic in your projections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17223.276s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I understand there are some issues about space, although Mr. Murphy said it was not space alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17229.0s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Probably the hiring, I would guess, is one of the most difficult things altogether.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17236.024s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But how are we going to accommodate the other families who are not accommodated in this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17242.548s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And what, what else can we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17244.251s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I wondered and I realized, I absolutely get that there's a whole nother oversight needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17251.542s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We've parents have mentioned that they wanted to be cooperative players I've remembered the days of preschools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17258.072s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: where there were cooperative preschools and parents volunteered maybe to work on a Monday and Wednesday, and then their kids went and other parents took over in other days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17268.66s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And again, I fully appreciate that's a whole nother level of organization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17275.385s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But if hiring is the issue,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17278.594s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And if we're looking still at this gap of 84 families, and I don't know if it's spread throughout the district in particular, that seems to me that's the next challenge and what are we gonna do about that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=17293.066s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But again, I say this almost kind of like torn, because I wanna tell you, I very much appreciate the work that's been done and the steps that are positive moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=18895.528s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I actually have a question on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=18899.029s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=18899.31s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just have to raise my concern because I've looked at the schedule just to try and get more meetings in with our budget meetings and what we're expecting of our staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=18910.835s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, maybe we have to ask, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=18914.94s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Megan to spearhead this sort of meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=18919.143s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just have to express concern that, you know, I think we had 22 meetings last month and I wanna be as responsive to the parents as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=18931.352s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I wanna have maybe, you know, is there a way of working committee but a formal school committee meeting to meet with all the parents?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=18938.817s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It just doesn't seem like the most effective way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19294.912s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Van der Kloot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19296.193s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I was actually going to suggest the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19298.334s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think, Mike, my initial concern is we need to make sure that we're giving our administrative people space to do the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19308.878s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But this clearly needs to be in the mix.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19313.681s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The one thing about this topic is we've got to, this isn't one where there's opposition or we're at loggerheads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19321.484s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We all want the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19323.585s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We want this to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19324.925s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Everyone here, I have no doubt, wants this to happen in a positive way for our families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19457.168s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19459.129s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I fully support that we want to make sure that we are talking to parents and engaging with parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19467.711s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Whether we need a formalized process right now, I'm just trying to say, you know, I think we have a pretty good idea of what the issues are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19478.434s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Personally, we've got a very active, engaged group of parents who have, you know, clearly been able to make their voices heard and their<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19487.296s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: express their concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19489.437s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, there's nothing, Melanie, you're sure we can vote on your thing, but I don't want to formalize process and say we're going to have this survey and that survey and whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19499.261s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know exactly what it is that you want, that we're not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19507.017s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm responding to short.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19509.099s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We can't trust our staff to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19511.14s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I trust our staff is going to talk to these people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19931.437s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, it was referenced in the minutes that we received tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19939.401s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I was in the elementary meeting on the second night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19943.282s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I did hear the parents extensively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19946.064s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I realized that you weren't able to be there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tLacBRpCBlE&t=19949.265s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So that may be why we've got a slightly different perspective than you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=13.137s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Right, and I'm sitting in for Melanie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=266.456s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, at least for a while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=636.66s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that in terms of the role, it should be done so that the school committee role is called and announced by the mayor and then it should be, then the student rep should be introduced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=652.145s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I want a differentiation between it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=656.366s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I know that you're going to spend more time at some point talking about the role of the student reps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=664.037s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I had some misgivings or concerns about some areas of your conversation only because in my long-term, I will tell you that there are years that you have great student reps and they're there and they're participating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=680.411s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And there's years where you don't, and there's years where you have very confident kids and years where you don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=686.756s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And we just need to be very, very careful about what we're setting up so to make it a true positive learning experience rather than someone on the hot seat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=698.563s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And we need to be aware of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=700.904s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We happen to have had some very strong representatives while you guys have been on the committee, but that's not always the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=709.288s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And there were years when, frankly, we didn't have kids who were interested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=716.032s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: you don't you don't want to put them in a place of embarrassment either where you're keeping on asking if they're present and they're not or something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=723.441s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just think one we need to I think it's great and we certainly just prior to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=732.612s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: When Dr. Perlow was the head, we had had some discussions because I think Paul, I think you and I had, we had actually gone to a MASC event about student reps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=746.668s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I talked to many student reps about what their role was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=750.753s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I came back feeling that we weren't being significant about it, but then that kind of fell through the cracks because we changed, you know, principles and we're starting, we started over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=763.225s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So anyway, that's my two cents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=834.796s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know, cause I haven't really thought about it, but I mean, now when they, now often the mayor will make an announcement as she, when we call the roll, she'll make an announcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=848.226s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So it's sort of to formalize that so that she'll also announce who's present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=883.204s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, but those two people aren't part of the quorum, Jenny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=886.066s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That's why I was making the- I know, Paulette.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=900.854s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I don't- Dave has his hand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=935.242s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We took the role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=936.022s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And then if the students were present, the mayor announced them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=956.053s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, I think what the problem is, is whether the mayor, what Jenny's saying is she doesn't know whether they're there, and probably Brianna doesn't always know if they're there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=967.302s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so by calling their name, you know if they're there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=971.285s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1394.402s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1405.573s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Sorry, I don't want to belabor the point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1408.934s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I was just concerned about making a separation so it was clear for people who didn't know, you know, that they're not voting members or something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1416.657s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: They're student members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1418.018s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So anyway, I think we should go on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1615.988s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1616.968s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I've always seen it as the warmup, but I can understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1625.839s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, I've questioned about the report of the secretary because I think it's just something that's been on there forever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1633.287s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I mean, different people have handled it in different ways, but, you know, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1646.36s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So that, you know, if you can, I just don't know whether it makes sense if we were looking to take something out, but I'm not the secretary right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1657.784s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But I do know that when you're the secretary, I mean, Kathy used to go and she would highlight a particular bill or something, you know, which sometimes was interesting, but, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1669.99s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, it's not that as secretary you get so many, I mean, it's a rare time that you would get a letter or something that went to you only, except now that we have the school committee, you know, letters, which come under community participation, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1753.503s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Particularly in the recent times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1757.003s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, you know, this has been extraordinary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1775.895s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, the interesting thing is if the secretary is called on nowadays, he or she should be called on during community participation to say, are there any letters that have been sent in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1790.021s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So in some ways, the secretary's report should move and be part of community participation to highlight the outside letters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1804.316s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And that piece sometimes, frankly, the mayor forgets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=1808.557s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So it would be useful to have, it's a tweak, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2110.867s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that the motion should be that the secretary's report be moved to under community participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2130.492s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Right, a bullet underneath.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2174.118s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I need you to just in a sentence or two, tell me exactly what you're saying when you say consent agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2208.176s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that you can do that for minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2213.177s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that there are certain ones that have to be called.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2217.419s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think you have bills and payrolls, I think have to be,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2223.328s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we need to investigate that to find out whether that's true or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2227.73s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But that's my, for the ones that we can, I'd certainly be, that would be okay with me, but we need to be clear which ones are which.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2329.854s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, yeah, sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2332.735s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I'll look at it later, but I'd like to see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2336.148s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So if you found one that has it, that'd be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2415.496s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, we can move it forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2417.937s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2418.277s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I have to think about it a little more, but we certainly can move it forward to the main meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2425.222s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2429.784s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2432.265s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2461.194s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Let me flip back to... Okay, members of the council and Graham, unfortunately at this point I need to leave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2474.159s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, take care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=2475.499s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Bye-bye everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=3250.585s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1FDL4VUFRG4&t=3251.285s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=159.662s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Are we going to have an initial introduction?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3943.353s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Let me, I put it in the chat, but I think it said, Medford Public Schools provide safe and equitable learning environments that fosters academic success, personal growth, positive relationships, civic responsibility, adaptability and resiliency for all our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3967.538s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: A lot of our conversation was about, there was nothing wrong with the vision statement as written, but it was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3974.644s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, tended towards to be too encompassing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3977.085s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, a lot of our discussion really was, we really liked one from Boston, Paul, every student, every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=3987.189s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4033.472s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So the one that I read, what we were really talking about is what key phrases came up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4040.075s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And we had a discussion about how important the school environment, how it had become clear this year that the school environment was so important in nurturing our kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4052.46s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And we talked about equity, and we talked about adaptability and resilience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4056.822s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So we were just trying to incorporate some of those key concepts, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FQmLWv7cB1A&t=4063.125s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But, you know, the shorter the better in so many ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=188.358s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=2105.774s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor, I'm gonna ask if you could just skip to the next item of business and take this up last.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=2111.718s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm switching back and forth, because I also have community participation letters, and so I'm not quite ready.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=2119.302s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So if you could just do some of the other subcommittees first, I'd appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=2982.41s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I would actually like to table them to the next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=2984.771s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I see that Dr. Quilles' report, a link wasn't provided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=2989.732s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And the discussion will make much more sense with that link.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=2992.372s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm going to talk to, we'll figure it out by the next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3178.345s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, Mayor, we received six communications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3181.489s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The first one is entitled Info Request for Advisory Committee Columbus School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3186.455s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It was submitted by Luchita Hiller, 58 Metcalf Street, Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3192.299s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She says, hi, I am trying to find information on how to apply for the advisory committee in charge of picking the new names to replace existing Columbus school name and how to submit new name nominations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3204.408s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I have been looking through the MPS website and could not find anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3207.991s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Can you direct me to the right place where this information lives?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3211.034s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3213.976s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Would someone like to address that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3243.541s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3244.442s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So the next letters, there's five letters and they're all on the same topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3248.648s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll read one from the first one that was submitted on this topic was from Sharon Hayes of 69 Ripley Road and then I'll tell you who submitted the other ones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3259.883s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It says, dear superintendent and school committee members, I am writing to you as a parent of two elementary school children who are currently enrolled in the full remote learning at the Roberts and who will remain in remote learning for the rest of the school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3272.226s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I am very concerned that the students who plan to remain in the remote classes not be subjected to additional changes due to the April 5th shift to full-time in-person learning for the current hybrid students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3284.188s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The remote teachers have spent the last six plus months working hard to create a classroom community and new daily routines in virtual learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3291.514s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: While both of my boys are struggling with the virtual aspect of virtual learning, they love being a part of the classroom community and seeing the same classmates and teacher every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3301.401s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And as a parent, I know that the classroom routines keep them feeling grounded and secure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3305.764s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If any of these things are changed now with less than a third of the year remaining, if students are regrouped and put with different classmates and or a new teacher, it will cause yet another major disruption in the lives of young children who are still living through an intensely difficult and traumatizing event.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3322.479s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Please do not make changes to the remote learning classrooms between now and the end of the school year."<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3328.784s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That sentiment was shared and we received a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3334.53s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: email from Arshia Amina of 37 Ashland Street, from Shanine Pelequin, she did not give an address, of Michelle Ciccolo of 28 Douglas Road, of Wynette Vo,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3359.114s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, also no address and of Claire Flaherty of Marshall Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3365.716s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, all of those, these centers, uh, echoed the same concerns of the first letter, um, about remote learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=3443.457s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: May I ask, Superintendent, are you going to address this this evening?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=4990.376s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=4991.73s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I would raise my hand also to express my concerns that it seems like we've made a commitment to our remote kids and it doesn't seem fair to all of a sudden put them in a predicament, though I hear what you're telling us, Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=5009.517s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think probably right now it makes most sense to turn to the community members who've had their hands raised for quite a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=8563.112s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=8564.353s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I wanted to ask another question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=8566.294s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Why don't we vote on this one first?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=8607.988s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I just want to ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=8609.088s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, the programs that we spoke about this evening are also the programs that have taken place before, so it's great to have an update about them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=8616.99s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But are we anticipating any further remedial type programs for students during the summer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=8623.132s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I was kind of curious about where we're going to go with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=9228.847s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=9229.228s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Do we have a rain date for graduation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=10147.516s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes I just I want to it's I've received another email and I did note that the speaker was was here I see him but it's from Matthew Page Lieberman of 15 Canal Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=10163.424s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: His question is I'd like to know what options are available to a MHS senior<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=10171.281s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I recently met who told me of her struggles to get the assistance she requires for her mental health from the school system after attempts have failed with her guidance Councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=10182.425s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I can answer a couple of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=10250.541s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=10252.942s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So can I direct the sender to tell the student to contact you directly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=10263.672s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, and that you will make sure, or superintendent, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=10408.804s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zdRFAfm1Rlg&t=10815.139s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=1167.157s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: HAB-Juliette Boone, Moderatoring): Jenny has her hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2030.491s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I just wanted to suggest that it would be a better use of our time rather than guessing at this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2036.753s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I know I've had very detailed conversations about the air compressors with John McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2041.674s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If he was here, he would be answering every one of our questions on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2046.015s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, and I remember when they were replaced, um, the same thing with the other, uh, the details along the fire extinguishers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2053.421s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So it might be that we want to, um, hold the details and ask John for an update on the specifically on the, um, uh, what you're referring to the document you're referring to Jenny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=2127.35s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Do we expect John to be joining us later in the meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=3040.422s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, so I need to understand what we need to decide tonight, because clearly there's a much larger<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=3049.718s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: question, which is to say, how much money are we going to put into the current Medford High School?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=3056.522s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If in fact, at some future time, we envision a rebuilding or something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=3064.526s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I need to know just tonight, what decision we need to make?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=3071.709s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Was this brought to us because we're trying to make a decision about whether we're gonna expend the money for the bathrooms?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x6UMczRpx7Y&t=3258.812s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor, are we discussing the superintendent's contract now, or?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=111.73s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Hi, everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=837.135s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Melanie?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=840.336s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I had sort of a question, comment, a little bit different than where you're going right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=844.996s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But just in terms of thinking about our kids, I know that last week I had occasion to have to go down to Mass General Hospital to see a friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=854.878s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And, you know, my reaction was there was all these people there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=858.98s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: What were they all doing there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=860.4s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I was used to being in spaces that were very distant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=865.183s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And all of a sudden there were lots of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=867.664s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Everybody's wearing masks and all that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=869.184s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But, you know, I'm kind of wondering about kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=871.425s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And Stacey kind of veered in when you mentioned, you know, all the kids who've been on remote all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=877.988s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But as we are looking for kids coming back into school who have been<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=882.951s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: given this message over and over again to keep their distance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=887.275s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And now we're potentially going down and you know from 6 feet to 3 feet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=893.562s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, I know how I reacted I and I've talked to other people and they've had similar reactions so what about kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=1015.281s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm wondering about the short term the kids who are coming back in, you know, in the coming weeks to all of a sudden, you know, four day or five day learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=1025.396s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, what we're thinking about and helping them adjust to this, more bodies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=1031.463s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And again, I'm really thinking about the kids who are prone to anxiety already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=1053.441s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Are we talking to teachers at all about, you know, having them be watching for this kind of anxiety?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=1076.702s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=4859.368s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just wanted to say to Dr. Cushing, it probably, so right now it sounds like the RFP is being prepared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=4868.995s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This is something that I think the Buildings and Grounds Subcommittee should also hear about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=4896.223s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm just saying, Peter, it's such exciting news now that it's back on the block.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=4902.865s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So at some point, think that the Buildings and Grounds Subcommittee should<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6ToLK-34czQ&t=4908.007s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: also be updated when you get the chance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=985.906s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I just want to mention that one of the real key issues about the after school program is personnel, is getting enough people to cover the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=997.875s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's been a real challenge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1000.658s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So even if you look at enrollment, whatever, obviously the answer is to expand it, but expansion has been<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1007.579s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: tough because of the lack of people who want to apply for the relatively low paying jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1017.643s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's also, it's not just the low pay, it's also the hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1022.625s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Many of our teachers have already worked a full day, so they're not particularly interested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1026.667s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We've tried students coming in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1028.689s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We certainly bring in a certain amount of high school students, but they need to be overseen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1034.114s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So absolutely what we would like is to be able to expand it to accommodate every family who needs it, because that's the answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1041.642s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But it is challenging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1269.285s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It sounds like we will need to be having a separate committee of the whole meeting for this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1275.306s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1437.439s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Special Ed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1438.48s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1439.18s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I forget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1440.101s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you want me to get the list and take a look?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1441.562s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We used to have support services, and it fell under support services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1447.906s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, you want to just read off the titles, Dave?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1470.086s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So we used to have one that was called support services and when they were shrunk to a more manageable level, that is not as clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1484.235s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, you could argue it in any number of different ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1488.218s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That's why I said committee of the whole partly because I think that all the members will be interested in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6l2icIZ4Tvg&t=1743.489s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I just wanted to ask Dave if he could give us an idea of what time you had in mind for these dates, the 4-27, 4-28, 4-29.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1.891s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: First of all, I love the historical research and I personally think that is a contender for the name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8.757s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't think we should limit our name only to people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14.563s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think just going ahead and voting on that tonight, we would not be following any of our policies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21.249s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We wouldn't be following our naming policy, which there is actually a naming policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=25.7s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we've kind of set people up for expecting that there might be a process for naming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=33.867s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There's a whole lot of me which would like to say yes, but you know, let's just vote it now and over with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=40.493s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I will tell you that from all the letters we've received and the discussions we've had,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=44.837s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: there will certainly still be part of our population which disagrees with the change altogether, no matter what we say or do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=53.34s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And that is because they feel that something is being taken away from them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=57.021s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And of course, all of my efforts have this point have been trying to move us in a direction where we could in fact choose a name, which is good for everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=68.784s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I do think your suggestion hits that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=72.156s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, as vice chair, I need to report that there were more than 100 letters in the school committee account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=84.263s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Many of those letters, and if I read all 100, we will literally be here for hours and hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=91.648s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We could just turn off this and I could read for the next five hours and start our discussion at midnight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=97.951s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I want to mention,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=101.289s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: right now that we had 96 people asking us to supporting the name change and we received one petition from our resolution with 391 Medford residents signing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=119.249s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The other last time we did receive a petition from Medford United, which also had, I think it was close to 600 Medford residents signing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=132.159s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I did read that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=134.201s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If I need to go back, I can find that and read it into, all of this will be put into the record though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=141.466s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: A little tricky because in this particular time, we only have three communications<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=147.053s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: opposed to the name change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=150.276s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, and we know that there are far more letters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=155.179s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Some of the letters have come into my private account as opposed to the school committee account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=160.343s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We did receive one letter from Mr. Petrella, which I'm just going to mention because he said that he had his hand raised or was, and he didn't get to speak at our last meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=173.152s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I want to make sure that we're not overlooking anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=201.124s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, and I would personally like to ask, if people are speaking, please turn on your cameras so we can see you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=208.206s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's just, I know you're not mandated to, but it is much easier for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=214.167s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So if you can, that's a personal request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=216.508s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If you don't want to, that's your option, I guess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=222.869s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Anyway, so that's the letters received up to this point, and they've been coming in pretty consistently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=230.971s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: At this point, I'll just give it as report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=232.913s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: They'll be all put into the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=235.755s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And if anybody wishes me to do anything differently, I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=241.999s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm at the it's at the will of the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=638.152s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So a couple of different things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=639.552s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor, like you, I went down and I distilled from both member Rousseau's and my own resolution key talking points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=653.216s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I asked Peter if he would put them up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=656.857s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think they're similar to yours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=658.377s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There may be one difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=662.032s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Because I don't really think it's a choice between mine and Paul's so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=667.479s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that member Rousseau, because he was dedicated to doing this, sort of got out and laid out a process and giving<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=678.653s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: us all the opportunity to say, yep, that works for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=683.438s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: No, it doesn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=684.359s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I wrote mine down because it was pretty convoluted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=688.303s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But the six key talking points really covers the most important things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=695.37s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, I had mentioned the other day at our meeting on Monday that I do have concerns about the timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=703.876s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And my concerns about the timeline are because not in the first part, not the, you know, application process,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=714.022s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We actually have, member Kretsch suggested April 30th, the meeting is on April 26th, which both member Ruseau and myself put as the date to choose the advisory committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=726.986s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But it's the time, how much time does the advisory committee have to work?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=732.228s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And part of that is asking, what are we asking them to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=739.531s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So these are the key talking points that I put forward that you're seeing on the screen right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=746.313s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: One is how is the advisory committee chosen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=749.234s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And by the way, the application, I had one additional thing about availability and time, but otherwise mine and member Rousseau's, I think we're pretty close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=759.765s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: and not particularly complicated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=763.129s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But point number two is what is the makeup of the advisory committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=766.492s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Three, once names are submitted for consideration, what is the next step in the process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=772.264s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Four, what is the charge to the advisory committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=775.265s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: What are we asking them to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=777.306s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Five is how is the chair or co-chairs chosen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=780.426s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And six, does the advisory committee bring one choice to the school committee for confirmation or up to three for our selection?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=787.409s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Those are really the key points that member Brousseau and myself look at in different ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=796.733s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's just, I put that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=799.335s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I know there are many hands raised now, so I'm just gonna lay that out right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1548.311s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I would like to address one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1551.373s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Many people are speaking about all the different things that the school committee faces, and that's absolutely true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1558.537s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We have a lot of work ahead of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1561.559s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: However, and part of this is being brought about, well, you need more time to hear us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1569.033s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We have heard strongly from the community, and I myself have gone and spoken to some members who are very anti the change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1578.579s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's very, very difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1580.56s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But to say you don't have enough time, well, frankly, we're a pretty dedicated bunch all across.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1587.164s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I don't think that once we get through<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1591.707s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: the process and work it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1593.948s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And there will be some things that I speak to, like removing one piece, we'll get to it later, off of a school committee onto a committee of the whole instead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1605.912s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, so I do, and the other thing which I think is key for me to say as the longest serving school committee member is, and when this first came up, I spoke to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1617.856s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, when this first came up, I will tell you, and I've said to other people, I wasn't happy with the process, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1625.262s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Because at that first meeting, I felt confident in that, yes, I did feel there was a reason to change it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1634.17s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You must remember that there was in light of a very<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1638.133s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: a spring of great reckoning and understanding of what was going on in our world and the racism that exists that we all saw with our own eyes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1651.088s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And there is a context to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1654.568s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But 20 years ago, when we built the new schools, I can absolutely tell you that there was a discussion in the committee, in the Building the Future Committee of which I was part, about the naming of the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1670.523s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And at that time, we were well aware that there were people who would much prefer it not to be the Columbus School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1681.029s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I've kicked myself sometimes because I let that go, partially in deference to a community member who I had great respect for and who didn't want it to change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1693.162s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But it's been a recurring<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1698.328s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, maybe you haven't heard it, but I have over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1704.191s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I've heard it, I've had discussions down at the Columbus School with parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1708.093s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So it's not that this just popped up and there's been, it's not been part of our discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1715.577s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It has been particularly for parents whose children attend the Columbus School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1721.881s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And that certainly isn't to say that everybody agrees, but it's certainly been there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1737.013s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So the time has to do with the timeline that she's suggesting is part of the discussion that we'll have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1746.54s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We're sort of talking two different things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1749.162s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I too, after I worked out my resolution, believes that it would be great to have more time, which is to say a number of weeks more to come to the conclusion of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1762.242s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I've built in and will talk to my committee about saying that I think that once we put the advisory council together and they begin their work, that they are the ones who will need to be able to say to us, hey, we need eight more weeks, or we need 12 more weeks, or we think this has to be the timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1781.687s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But that's a discussion that as we work out the particulars of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1785.688s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The other thing is the reality of it is, and we just have to say this, and it's just blunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1791.809s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: When people are saying they haven't been heard, we have heard them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1796.67s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But unfortunately, we don't necessarily agree with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1800.752s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We are not agreeing to change, to not change the name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1806.214s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So people keep on saying, you haven't heard us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1809.615s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, we are hearing you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1811.316s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And quite honestly, I mean, I had some great discussions and I was really moved at one point by one person who told me what Columbus Day meant in his family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1822.14s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I listened and I heard that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1824.482s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I've heard other people say we're erasing history.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1827.164s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We're still going to teach our kids about Columbus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1830.126s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It is part of our education strands.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1835.751s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's not like we're just saying, and Columbus had, hey, there were some things that were good about him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1841.095s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: What we're saying is, is he, is this name the one we want to represent this educational facility in our community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1852.085s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You have voted for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1855.54s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: the committee, six members plus the mayor, this community voted for us to do what we think is best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1862.243s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This is not an easy job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1864.524s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It is painful, it is tough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1866.905s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: One of my committee members said to me, you know, Paulette, the problem with you is you wanna make everybody happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1871.648s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's absolutely true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1873.348s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't wanna piss anybody off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1875.369s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And no matter what I do, I'm going to make some people unhappy in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1880.232s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I am being true to myself,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1883.473s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I've worked, spent hours and hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1885.554s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And by the way, those hours were not conflicting with the other work that I do, talking to administration, saying, hey, can we work on this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1891.597s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Hey, what about that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1892.478s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, I've got lots of hours in my day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1896.02s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But trying to say, how does this process work?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1900.082s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And is there a way that the process can help bring this community together?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1905.865s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I listened on Monday when Mr. McKillop suggested that we start all over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1912.31s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And for a while back, I was there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1915.471s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I was wondering about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1917.351s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But I came, thought deeply and said, you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1920.331s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: At this point, we have had lots of opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1924.112s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: People in Medford are aware of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1926.733s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I walked my dog this afternoon with someone I didn't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1929.953s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She's not particularly involved at all in the politics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1933.054s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I said, wow, I've got a heavy meeting tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1935.154s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And she said, oh yeah, it's the Columbus naming issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1938.835s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: People know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=1940.635s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3233.909s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: When member Rousseau created the form, he had on his form that someone applying for the advisory council committee, sorry, would also be submitting a name on the same form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3247.2s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I have severed the forms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3249.121s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I have you apply for the advisory committee or you're putting in a name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3254.105s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Anybody who is a member of the advisory committee<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3257.899s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: on the advisory committee can certainly put in a name, but they're two different forms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3262.964s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It'll just be more easy to organize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3266.226s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Here's the list of names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3267.528s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Here's the list who's applying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3270.29s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The other difference in our form is I also asked on the one for the advisory committee,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3278.357s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I asked when they were available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3281.459s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So there's a line that says, you know, can you tell us when you're available?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3285.723s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Because I think we need to know if people are only available one day a week, that might not be sufficient.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3293.169s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If they're only available between four and six on Tuesdays,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3297.331s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: that may be difficult, and so that's why I asked that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3301.553s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The other thing is when I wrote mine, I put a statement in it as opposed to a question, and member Rousseau knows about this, a statement saying that if people needed interpretation services or computers, whatever, that that would be supplied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3321.34s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So it's a statement rather than asking them if they<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3324.761s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: it's just makes it clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3351.838s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Can I ask the question differently, Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3354.879s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Instead of adding it on Member Ruseau's, could we just use mine instead?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3360.381s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Because I've already written it all out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3362.422s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And since Member Ruseau submitted the other one, I'd like to hear if he's, you know, these are my suggestions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3371.725s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It would just be easier unless there's a lot of controversy about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3471.587s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So instead of working from either resolution, can we work from the list of questions that either you or I put forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3478.869s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Because that then is going to, we can, one of those is addressed in that list of what I said were the key questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=3488.32s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, so if we if we worked from the key questions, then we would be, then we would have the discussion about each of our different approaches.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6722.512s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Just so you know, on this, as this differs from Paul's in just two ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6729.477s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I added the sentence about, are you related to the name you submitted?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6734.84s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I also asked that each name be submitted on a different form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6742.813s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Otherwise, mine and Paul's are the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6791.435s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I forgot to add that, Paul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=6793.115s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It should be added.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7179.202s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: On mine, I have a separate paragraph devoted to the Columbus School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7184.044s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, the original intent was to have a very lengthy process with students being involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7190.908s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The time frame makes it shorter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7193.459s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: and certainly will not be as we intended when the original motion was drawn up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7203.324s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But there is a piece that's dedicated to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7268.7s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, so I think that there was a difference in Paul and mine about the date that the applications were due.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7276.645s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And part of it is that there's a vacation week built in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7280.908s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So he had them due on the Friday of vacation week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7287.452s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So which, Paul, if I recall, originally it was April 26th, 24th, 23rd, right on yours?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7293.576s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7297.691s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I pushed it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7301.395s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7301.715s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's the Friday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7302.616s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's the Friday of vacation week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7305.699s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's usually the day when we're then getting our packets of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7311.905s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I gave more time, less time to apply.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7316.129s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I have it done on Friday, April 16th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7320.665s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: which does cut off time, but it's because of vacation week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7324.606s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I wanted to make sure that our office staff had enough time to collect all the applications, to collect the names, and to prepare them to give them to us as appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7337.309s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So that was the reason why Paul and I had a different time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7343.391s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to be clear on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7349.452s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: April 16th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7350.272s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So in essence, people have four weeks to apply.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7361.314s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7365.514s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Again, it just had to do with the vacation week issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7388.785s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You could, I just didn't know who was gonna be, since it's vacation week, who was gonna be in the office and they need to be collated and sent out to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7398.093s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So you could, but just realize whatever office staff<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7403.97s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: is in the superintendent's office or whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7416.613s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Wait, say that again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7448.755s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So Mayor, Paul and I, and this is one of those key talking points that I mentioned to you earlier, we have a big difference between us on the process of what happens to the name submissions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7465.661s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I have them all going, if we receive 50, I have all 50 going immediately to the advisory committee once it's formed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7476.563s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Paul has a process where we wheedle them down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7481.744s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: What happens is we would, at our school committee meeting on April 26, which is what he designated, and Paul, if you wanna speak to this, because I'm speaking for you,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7492.126s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But he had it that the school committee would wheedle down the number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7498.129s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So let's say we got 100, we would each pick four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7501.511s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And he has a fairly involved process where they're weighted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7504.412s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I found that confusing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7506.613s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I thought that the whole intent of the advisory committee was, in fact, to vet the names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7512.556s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I did not feel that I could receive the names on a Friday, April 23, and in our Monday meeting, April 26.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7520.376s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: be willing or able to then only send to the committee my top four choices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7528.339s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's a very significant difference on how we approach this question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7668.501s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, just to answer that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7670.542s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Or we can set ourselves up for failure by receiving, if you're a number, Paul, of 300 on Friday afternoon, and expecting me without, I don't have any time to vet them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7683.087s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And on so what basis am I going from 300 to four?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7687.148s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's just not real.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7688.128s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The reason you have the advisory committee is to do the work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7691.47s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, part of it will be when they will go through and, you know, the first ones, they'll, you know, but that's not, if you're having us do that initial work selection without establishing what criteria we're using, it's a crapshoot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7714.118s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think that it undermines the whole process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=7863.875s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So can you use mine, my wording since I worked it out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8480.339s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, um, so in my mind we're not erasing history we're changing a name to what might be a more appropriate name in this day and age.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8490.772s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Columbus will still be taught, like you said he was a famous navigator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8495.282s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There's much history there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8497.384s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's to be appreciated in its totality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8501.769s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It is part of the Massachusetts strands of education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8505.934s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it's both fourth and then again in middle school where students discuss Columbus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8511.921s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So it's not in any way a shape to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8515.084s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: remove Columbus from the curriculum or not to teach it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8519.207s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It is a question of saying, what name do we want to put on this building that will embrace and bring our community together?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=8532.336s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Unfortunately, Columbus is very divisive, as you can see in this discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9020.322s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Ruseau had that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9143.092s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I, I think that's problematical Melanie, because so many people have already felt that they haven't had the opportunity to speak to now say that this may take us another three hours to work through the whole document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9156.019s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think the way the mayor's been feeding them in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9159.741s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: As time-consuming as it is and how sometimes questions are being asked that we will answer, I think we just have to be short and say, we'll get to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9170.509s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But I think you might make a tough situation even more difficult if you shut down any ability to talk while the meeting is proceeding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9188.592s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: how some people might perceive it, Melanie, and I know you're always open to hearing from her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=9330.381s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=10850.519s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, Nadia.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=10852.22s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The question for me is, and I've said this all along, is there no one else that we could honor from the Italian community that might in fact bring a great deal of pride<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=10872.313s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I understand people have very different feelings about Columbus, but part of the issue is, is there any way to move forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=10884.922s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We are saying we need to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=10888.225s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We understand, and I think a lot of this meeting is because we want everybody to speak, but again, part of the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=10896.206s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: the need at some point is to say, is there anybody else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=10900.169s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Who else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=10901.229s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And we're trying to say, if you want a voice in this, apply to the advisory committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=10907.474s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We're working out the nuts and bolts so that, and certainly all the work I did on the resolution was to make sure that no one person could slant the committee in such a way that a final name was predetermined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=10925.76s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, so that's just a, you know, that's part of what I was looking at is to make sure the process was clean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=10933.369s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I understand you don't like the back process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=10935.591s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I understand that it's painful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=10937.633s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I hear it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=10938.835s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But going forward, how can we make sure that we are doing the best job?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=10943.9s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I encourage you to please apply for the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11344.765s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11347.808s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I just wanted to mention that Ron Giovino has had his hand up for a long time, but he doesn't have one of the regular little hands.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11356.078s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So just to make sure he's on your list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11421.035s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Ron, what's your address?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11661.784s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I think people should also only have one last chance to talk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11666.728s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that we've allowed ample opportunity for people to, you know, and many people have spoken several times and,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11676.354s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think that we've been more than generous with time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11680.856s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If there's people who haven't spoken, they should get a chance to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11685.399s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But we're getting tired and the commentary is dissolving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11713.16s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So one of the questions is I've seen principal K here and some level of question was around the Columbus participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11724.388s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I wondered if we should,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11729.497s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Talk about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11731.098s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Paul and I do have the Columbus participation in a different way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11736.582s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, it is part of the bigger question of who's going to be on the advisory council, membership on the advisory council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11745.408s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Perhaps, you know, when you have multiple devices and then they close on you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11755.536s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This one's Paul's, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11758.74s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Anyway, would that be acceptable?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11762.884s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor, can I talk about that for a minute?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11766.207s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, please do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11767.048s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11768.889s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: First, I have a paragraph about participation by the Columbus School staff and students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11773.843s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's a separate paragraph says in recognition that the staff and students of the Columbus school are dedicated to their school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11781.771s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The school committee requests the principal to create a representative group of staff to solicit input from their colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11789.039s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Additionally, student input is highly desirable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11792.62s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And if it is feasible, student participation will be encouraged in any way the principal deems to be workable in this very short period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11804.765s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The goal of both staff and student input is to come up with three to five names to submit for consideration to the advisory committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11813.488s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The names will be submitted by April 26th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11816.79s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So we're saying<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11818.257s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: to the principal, there's only four weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11824.662s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We had originally envisioned a much greater, longer period where we were gonna get student education and input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11834.212s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Therefore, in recognition of that, I'm saying, oh my gosh, you know, principal, I don't know what you're going to be able to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11842.999s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I don't, I understand to me, it's not, this is one of the problems with a very tight timeline, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11849.865s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's not giving a great opportunity for student input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11856.229s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Furthermore,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11859.747s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: the principal of the Columbus or her designee, as well as two staff members selected by their peers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11866.171s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And then I have, or appointed by the principal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11868.812s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I didn't know which way to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11869.933s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I wanted committee input and I wanted the principal's input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11915.296s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: overall intent, Columbus participation, the overall intent was that we originally said we wanted some student participation, and we were recognizing that the Columbus family if you would, including staff members should have some role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11939.253s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Ruseau will speak to this, but he identified six members as being on the advisory council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11945.939s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I thought that was a lot to ask for six members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11950.122s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm suggesting that the school have an internal process, however way they want to do it, to collect names that they want to submit, hopefully with some student input, but I don't know if the time allows, honestly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11962.573s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: and that there would be three members from the Columbus community, and that is the staff, okay, that would serve on the advisory committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11974.361s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And they would be elected either by their peers or appointed by the principal, depending on what we decided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11982.006s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So that was my thinking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=11996.644s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Right, but that was less than the six people that Member Ruseau suggested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12138.197s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor, can I just, one thing, Paul, I just don't know, and when Kathy can, Principal Kaye can advise us on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12150.366s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just don't know with teachers being at the end of the school year,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12154.329s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: and it's such a busy time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12155.81s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: A part of it was I was trying to lessen the obligation, even though I totally understand they may be fully invested or want to be invested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12165.017s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This is part, you know, this is why I've said from the outset, oh my gosh, I've got a problem with the timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12171.743s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's really tight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12172.924s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We're not being able to achieve some of our goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12175.906s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So, you know, that's my concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12295.976s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12302.105s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: For me, Principal Kaye, what I really want to be is respectful to the time, the limitations of time that you have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12311.552s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I wanted to make sure that there was some place where your school was represented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12316.556s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I personally understand completely that there may, you know, doing a big school project just doesn't necessarily make sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12325.903s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: unfortunately, right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12328.005s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So if you thought that, you know, if it was making everybody aware that they could submit names from your school and making, you know, that maybe would be what's really possible right at this point, making forms available, letting kids know, you know, whatever, that might be just, you know, what's real.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12351.725s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And if the, do you think that, so originally I think it was that you and, you know, there were five members all together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12361.052s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I suspect strongly there'll be some interest so that you'll be able to have staff members who will want to participate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12369.838s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Am I correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12391.7s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Did you see those though as members of the advisory committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12759.147s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So Dr. Kaye?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12760.908s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12761.668s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Are you saying that it would be better for the school not to submit names specifically from the school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12789.877s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so if you look at the paragraph that I wrote, which is on the screen, if we take away in the first large paragraph, if we take away the last sentence, the goal of both the staff and student input is to come up with three to five names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12807.547s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If we just take that out,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12810.31s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, remove that, then you have in recognition that the staff and students of the Columbus school are dedicated to their school, the school committee requests the principal to create a representative group of staff to solicit input from their colleagues oh um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12825.905s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, no, okay, that doesn't work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12865.645s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12866.526s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So my next sentence is, additionally, student input is highly desirable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12871.007s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And if it is feasible, student participation will be encouraged in any way the principal deems to be workable in this very short period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12880.33s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, that would work for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12881.823s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And then the last sentence to that paragraph is further the principal of the Columbus or her designee, as well as two staff members selected by their peers or appointed by the principal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12892.828s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I have a question mark there because I don't know which is better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12895.67s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know whether you prefer to say that you'll appoint them or whether you say, oh yeah, doing a vote is the better way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12913.233s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12914.114s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So we'll take about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12925.08s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12925.821s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12928.342s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, again, that's what I'm kind of suggesting to working through from what I heard Jenny say and whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12933.485s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Jenny, does that meet your?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=12989.83s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you think there should be more than the three representatives, or do you think that's a realistic number?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13025.887s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So why don't we just put the principal and as well as two to four staff members, and we can come back to that piece after we figure out the other members of the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13035.83s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That works for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13047.332s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, we can revisit it if it's too large.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13109.4s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You can take off the CCC.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13113.003s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I use that only because it was an easy way for students to be elected by their peers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13119.388s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so that's why I limited it that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13122.711s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And also because I know that they're a service organization interested in community participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13131.719s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Again, I'm just throwing out some of these things by saying there is having a high school student rep on any committee that we have is, I think, an appropriate thing to have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13143.868s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm absolutely fine with however people want to amend it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13203.319s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: slot that we want to may take a lot more time than, I mean, maybe there's a lot more interest than... So Mayor, that's why I designated the CCSR because they have, you know, meetings and they have, you know, it's just organizationally, it's a really easy way that kids can get together and vote and say who's from Columbus, who's interested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13390.99s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Graham, while they're trying to figure that out, bullet one and two essentially are the same and need to be condensed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13691.616s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, why don't we put, let's work through each of the lines and then figure out how many it comes up to, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13699.541s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The number one said the up to four names are, so it says the two names selected from the Columbus School and Principal Kathy Kay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13712.148s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So we had put the up to four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13718.28s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: individuals selected from the, it should say up to four individuals, not names, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13727.131s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you for doing this, Jenny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13729.493s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: No problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13742.358s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So on number two, it says each school committee member will select a member of the advisory committee from the valid applications received and will state the names publicly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13754.024s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: In the event that an application is selected by more than one school committee member, the members will continue to name applicants until a total of seven advisory committee members have been named.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13763.612s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Now that was a member Ruseau had done it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13767.515s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: He had suggested that every school committee select two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13771.679s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That put together a committee of 14 already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13775.542s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I was concerned about the overall size.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13778.465s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The process is the same that we each name<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13781.247s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: One, so we can look once we sort of figure out the total number of people, we can decide whether it should be one person or two people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=13794.313s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The next thought to any thought to allow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14036.37s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14040.874s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So again, I have two different committee members who have very different feelings about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14052.217s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: One wants each of us to pick two, and one wants everything to be done by lottery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14061.019s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I was looking for a middle road because I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14067.905s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The and to me the middle road and was do three by lottery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14072.209s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So there was some totally random piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14075.051s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, and And then do have each of the committee members pick one To be honest with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14084.38s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm very open to whatever the majority of the committee wants to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14088.143s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not stuck on any of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14089.824s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14091.045s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: explain where I was coming from and knowing Kathy had already said to me, I think everybody should be by lottery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14097.788s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I knew what Paul said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14099.569s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I was trying to bring everything together to a middle place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14103.811s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I personally believe that when it says select, if we decide that part of that selection should be by lottery, I'm not uncomfortable with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14112.095s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But clearly I didn't say we should select the whole committee to try and bring people together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14123.7s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14124.06s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Paul, can you go along with any piece of the, can you go along with three lotteries?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14156.269s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think I'm looking to bring people together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14158.449s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So Mm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14163.711s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14479.231s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: How does the administration feel about that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14802.521s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess, yeah, I need, I need you to say that again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14806.784s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, I'm troubled because I think that we as school committee members do, um, uh, have the ability to pick a person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14815.991s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think that we'll pick a person that will each have a criteria, um, that will not be the same, um, you know, uh, necessarily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14825.777s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, but that's why there's seven of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14828.679s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, you know, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14880.337s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And what if we don't like the committee that the superintendent or her designee comes up with?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14885.855s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, that's the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14904.079s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I'm open to hearing my colleagues, if everybody thinks that's gonna work, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14912.498s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Kathy, how do you feel about that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=14966.314s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I guess we just have to ask a superintendent, is that something which is comfortable for you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=15443.356s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think you can just go ahead and do that, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=15445.778s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We don't need a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16699.518s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So the answer simply is by statute,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16703.106s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The naming of school buildings belongs to the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16707.208s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The responsibility belongs to the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=16710.59s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17113.902s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I think it's inappropriate to single out a school committee members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17118.586s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I just, I think it's appropriate not to let that comment continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17706.872s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Why don't you go say the individual selected from the Columbus School and then parentheses say up to four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17714.321s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Principal Kathy Kay and the one MHA student will be announced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17919.475s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17923.517s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I would say the individuals, and instead of saying up to four, let's say up to three selected from the Columbus School staff, Principal Kathy Kaye, so that's four from the Columbus School,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17938.311s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: one Medford High School student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17940.593s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If we're saying that we're each gonna pick two, so we're up to five and two would be, 14 would be 19.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17948.961s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Then the chair would be number 20.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17953.665s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And the member from the historical commission is ex officio non-voting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17962.423s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I have 20 voting members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17964.063s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Now the question is whether we're gonna have those three selected by lottery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17970.365s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That was in direct response to Kathy's concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=17976.926s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18359.814s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor, you've already got, you've got five from number one, three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18365.098s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You've got up to, up to, okay, up to three, four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18370.503s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Five, so you've got five people in number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18373.225s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If we each pick two, that's four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18379.029s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: No, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18398.778s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18568.641s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so you, so the chair would be chosen by the mayor before the meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18592.131s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18646.867s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm okay with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18647.667s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think I would say chair or co-chairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18653.499s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, I just, and that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18657.82s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: However you wanna do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18668.604s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I was giving the responsibility to the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18674.686s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We could say that the person that she picks, since we're each picking two, that one of her picks will be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18682.415s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: for the chair or co-chairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18693.882s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, but it doesn't necessarily, in terms of the voting, it doesn't necessarily matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18709.03s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So part of the question is we're also asking whether they're gonna<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18712.688s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, when we get to the process of how many names they're gonna give us, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18727.693s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18762.245s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And the only problem with that, I mean, it definitely works, but who's organizing that first meeting then?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18768.368s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Who's sending out the notices?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18772.649s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That's what the problem is if you have the committee pick their own, if you have the advisory committee pick their own leadership, it starts it all out and how long does it take to get to that decision?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18869.857s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18872.238s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18873.999s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So the reason why I originally said the mayor will appoint was because I wanted the mayor to do some legwork in advance of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18880.6s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: this to search out people who would be interested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18886.625s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so that she would know who the chair was gonna be rather than leaving it up to who applied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18893.89s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, I needed, I'm thinking when we had advisory committees before, for example, for building the schools, the mayor sought out people to be chairs and appointed them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18910.922s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I will, by the way, tell you that this committee is larger than the building the future committees were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18922.927s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Nobody's amused by that, I guess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18970.685s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Do we need, are we keeping in the three additional names by lottery, just?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18976.948s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18977.829s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18993.557s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, and the chair is a voting member, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18997.339s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=18998.735s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And the historical person, I was really hoping, I put it in your lap, Mayor, because I just thought that you would be a good point person for reaching out to the historical society and asking, we're going to need help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19014.849s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The advisory committee is going to need help looking into the history of some of the people that are suggested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19045.895s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And potentially, since they're non-voting members, it could be more than one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19105.352s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Paul had that in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19107.333s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I did not have it in mine, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19109.451s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You could add that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19117.813s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it's too big, but that's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19180.763s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We have to look at this again in light of our other discussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19191.107s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So change up to four, up to three staff members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19198.93s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, that's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19242.721s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just think that, yeah, I think we have to be really realistic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19304.264s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: No, this is just the work of the advisory committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19307.145s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19309.987s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19312.782s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, for number two, I think it's important that there, it's very possible that there will be people who are not aware of the letters that we've received and the depth of angst.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19328.969s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So for that reason, I wanted them to have access in a file to the letters so they could understand what kind of letters we've read, we've gotten.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19341.519s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So they don't have to read them, but I just want to say that they have access to them so they can understand what the discussion has been so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19358.735s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: OK, does anybody object to that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19363.099s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19363.86s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: OK, how about number three?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19380.11s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, now there's a crucial point here, and this is one of the key talking points that I mentioned right at the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19392.881s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There are two different ways we could go about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19395.962s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Paul suggested that the advisory council go all the way down to the single last name, they give a presentation, and the school committee votes to confirm it, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19408.947s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And frankly, he had that all done on the same night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19413.698s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I say that the advisory committee gives the school committee three names and the school committee then at a subsequent meeting, I don't think it should happen at the same meeting, that we pick one of the names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19433.409s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The arguments pro and against are, if we have the advisory committee pick the final name and then we just rubber stamp it, in many ways I feel like we're giving up our responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19447.173s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: However, I realize that others will have a different opinion about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19451.074s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But it's a clear, we have to make a decision about how we're gonna proceed on that particular point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19592.486s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, Paul, if you put it in those terms, I think that we have the responsibility to pick from three finalists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19599.551s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I would suggest that it would be OK with me if the advisory committee weighted them or numbered them or chose not to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19608.377s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We gave it to those equally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19610.398s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But if you put it in those terms, then I don't see how we can choose not to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19795.902s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, so my concern when you get down to two names is that it becomes polarizing again, right off the bat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19803.164s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I love the idea of involving the kids and the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19808.726s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There is a time factor for all of those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19812.208s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But I really would suggest that we might even have the kids go from three names to two names, or we're adding another process here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19822.884s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: but that's why you don't pick two names is because you have one Italian American and one black American, and there you are with your polarization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=19832.452s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's why I said three, up to three, I said up to three, somewhere along the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20198.922s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So it should be, we're chosen since there's gonna be more than one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20204.123s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We're chosen, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20205.363s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20229.533s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20230.534s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor, I agree with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20231.855s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm really concerned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20232.995s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, there's a whole lot of me which thinks that this work ought to happen in the fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20239.816s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: and a temporary name should be given to the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20241.977s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, you know, I guess the way that I would put is maybe put another line, if the advisory committee concludes or if a majority of the advisory committee concludes that they cannot complete this work in the timeframe specified, that they come before the school committee or that they communicate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20268.205s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: this to the school committee with a suggested new timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20273.928s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: How's that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20280.21s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, that would take care of the concern that I personally have that it's too much work and too little time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=20427.814s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I thought we just talked about that but then we did withdraw right here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21155.013s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's ludicrous to say that we can't change the date of the original motion to say that you know that if they need more time we'll give them another month and they can the Columbus can stay the Columbus for another month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21171.528s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21173.129s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: As many have said, we're during a pandemic, all the other timelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21177.23s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If you actually go back and read the minutes, and there is probably a problem with the minutes, but it doesn't reference the whole, it just says the name of the Columbus will change, and it doesn't put the date on what we actually voted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21188.373s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I went back and read it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21189.793s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Now the intent was clear, but I'm just saying, Paul, to hang your hat on and saying, you know, that's your personal thing that it has to change on July 1st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21199.767s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21200.488s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There's nothing in the world that says it can't change on August 1st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21206.291s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21207.232s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There's just nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21208.953s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And, you know, if you want to avoid the temporary date, I mean, somewhere along the line,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21216.719s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we've been working really well together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21218.94s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We've got different opinions about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21220.9s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, frankly, I'd like to say December 1st, because I think December 1st would be much more of a process of bringing kids in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21228.563s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: To me, there's a rush here, which is still really uncomfortable, but I need to ask you to move off that, oh my God, the world is gonna end on July 1st if we don't change the name of the Columbus School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21721.581s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, Secretary of State for Education and Human Services, to speak on behalf of the Board of Trustees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21764.093s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21766.094s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so that we just for an extra month, it would be called Columbus for an extra month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21771.279s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21771.939s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, if that is so unacceptable to my colleagues, then I would strongly vote for changing it to the South Medford Elementary School and not leaving it as an open, because I don't want that to become the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21785.575s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think, to me, it seems silly to have an interim name for just one month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21825.518s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We'll choose the temporary name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21859.164s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: No, that they have to give us a recommendation on July 31st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21864.17s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21875.558s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: When you say after that we will pick a name you're opening a whole new kettle of fish.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21898.598s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There is, the final date is July 31st, 2021.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21903.742s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And what if they just don't?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21911.126s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, if that happens- Three recommendations to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=21956.527s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that then in the off chance the school committee will, the school will be called the South Medford Elementary School until a name is decided upon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22042.392s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Anybody planning on going on summer vacation this summer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22307.177s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor, I need to add to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22309.737s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We also haven't covered the first part of this, page one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22314.598s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So our work is not done at the end of this page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22317.618s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And there are more people that would like to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22331.772s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: No, to keep it not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22335.073s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we should finish this sentence after July 31st, 2021.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22338.235s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22559.068s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Uh, so, um, I of course think this works just fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22577.893s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So mine is a little different from Paul's Paul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22580.494s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I made yours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22581.554s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I made it shorter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22583.115s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22584.335s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22586.551s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I added the most significant thing is a charge to the advisory committee where it says, I don't know how that just happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22606.104s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The way that we charge is the advisory committee with the task of vetting names submitted for consideration and weighing the relative strength of submissions against a criteria they will develop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22617.498s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The criteria will include but not be limited to such factors as the potential for the name to bring the community together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22625.928s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: the ability for the name to stand as a role model for Medford students, and the name as a representation of the Medford community's proud history.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22634.013s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Furthermore, the advisory committee is charged with narrowing the field of names to three finalists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22641.957s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And then at that point where it says these final names, and it says either, whatever, take out that sentence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22656.239s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So take out number B. The final exams will be presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22670.422s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So, Jenny, also the subset of A. Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22717.827s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So there is one difference, or at least one that I remember explicitly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22723.31s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Ruseau, you had that the names of Medford schools were named after an individual and we want to continue that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22731.074s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I do not specify that also because not all the schools were named after an individual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22735.936s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Also because maybe I almost anticipated that someone might<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22742.137s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: put in the name Mystic and I didn't want to not include that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22746.278s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I've not defined that and I think that for me, I'd rather have it open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22768.311s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't, because when you say Medford, Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22784.256s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Because I interpreted it differently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22797.721s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, obviously- That's not true, and it hasn't always been true in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22807.106s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, I feel like- Does Mystic count as a connection to Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22810.488s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22811.549s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22812.429s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22813.43s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I was just seeing it just as only, but it does mean that nobody can put in Da Vinci.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22822.034s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22824.315s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I kind of like Da Vinci.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22827.426s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Everything's named after him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22832.529s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Galileo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22835.671s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Galileo, are you sure you just, you know, if we just now put it, then we can see what they come up with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22867.324s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Melanie, in the charge, I wrote that the committee will come up with what they're measuring names against.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22877.946s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And one of the measurements is the connection to Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22881.847s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So it is there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22885.988s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22908.045s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22914.13s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22915.23s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This really comes to my discussion with Rick Orlando, who co-chaired the Building the Future Committee when we built the new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22923.252s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: He said the first thing that was really important is for the committee to come up with the criteria that they're going to measure their decisions against so that they've got some agreed standard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22935.194s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And he said that was really probably the most important thing that they did in making it flow so easily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TjgvMpuq30w&t=22940.615s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I thought that was important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=0.131s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'll read this, our normal paragraph.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=1865.25s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm gonna ask Maureen if you could keep it pretty short, because we need to get to the end of the presentation and then reflect back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=1872.135s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So Maureen, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=2647.878s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Dr. Kayes, can I interrupt for just one second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=2649.839s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Could you be clear?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=2654.883s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You said that you would be recommending, at which point would you be recommending a new reading program date-wise?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=2663.628s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that in next spring?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=2729.055s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Would every school have a pilot program?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=2766.538s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Right, and the goal would be to adopt the program K to five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=2772.639s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=2773.86s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, I mean, I certainly understand that as a parent who might have a, you know, second grader, they're counting and saying, oh, that's not gonna be made it, you know, for two years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=2785.582s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=2786.622s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm walking back a little bit and say, well, there'll be something tried in your school, but that's always the very hard part as our,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=2793.299s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: as we look at rollouts for new curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=2939.367s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=2940.648s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Dr. Chiesa, do you want to continue on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=2944.57s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3349.035s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Dr. Chiesa, thank you for your presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3352.516s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The first thing I'm going to ask you is for clarification, just so is the LexiaCorp V at 39,000, is that then would be a recurring yearly cost?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3366.259s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And last year- Correct, that is correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3369.02s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Last year it came out of the CARES money and-<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3374.885s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3386.09s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So they give it to you once for free because, and then they hope you get 40,000 plus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3410.378s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3411.859s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, I'm not saying we don't need it, and we certainly want the best for our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3418.044s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's just in terms of planning and knowing that that's a cost, it's significant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3427.132s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd like to, first if, Suzanne?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3503.158s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, I see Jenny has her hand raised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3507.222s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Jenny, unmute, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3914.043s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I see Susie your hand is raised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=3919.308s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You're muted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4006.716s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Let's see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4007.677s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Susie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4010.619s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Are there any other questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4016.963s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Comments?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4019.384s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Anybody want to add anything?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4022.606s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Sharon Hayes, I see that you've got your hand raised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4078.247s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Sorry, my video's off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4177.491s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4179.873s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Dr. Chiesa, I'd like to just ask you one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4182.254s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I know earlier this week, was it this week or last week, you had a meeting with the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4192.201s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, it was last week with the mayor and a group of parents who are very concerned about dyslexia in our system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4199.687s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Could you just tell us, just kind of sum up<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4206.662s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: the sense of what we're doing and what their concerns are going forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4214.305s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you think that the proposal is meeting the issues?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4220.667s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Will our new pick be comprehensive for this dyslexic issue?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4283.949s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4581.211s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4583.212s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4584.975s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4586.275s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Any other questions or comments?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4589.517s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If not, I would entertain a motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4596.859s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Motion to adjourn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4598.319s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4608.688s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4609.048s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you all so very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4611.209s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Dr. Chiesa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4615.311s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4615.751s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we're on at 545 again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4617.832s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4620.334s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And Peter, is Peter still on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4623.755s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4624.496s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Peter, I need to talk to you for a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4627.617s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So everybody else goodbye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4628.758s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4630.879s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Bye bye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4637.722s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Hold on one second, because we are still recording.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ncGsNyIdjFk&t=4641.735s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So just give me one minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5691.274s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Hi, so this is a very extensive, it was an extensive meeting, so I'm going to condense the minutes for the purpose of just sort of summarizing the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5702.223s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We had two presentations that evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5704.884s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The first was from Molly Leighton, director of our technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5709.984s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She spoke to the curriculum and what's covered in each of the grade levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5715.385s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She also spoke to questions like, what are her future goals?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5722.527s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She wants to expand the library makerspace, expansion of student tech help desks, bring girls who code club<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5731.384s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Medford Public Schools and build course pathways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5735.226s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Full-time librarians in all schools with certified school librarian tech integration leaders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5742.408s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She did note that the department is light.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5746.73s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Part of that, of course, is due to the tragic death of a staff member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5756.289s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the things that she also spoke of about was that computer skills, it's not just the computer classes, but also embedding skills within the curriculum across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5773.398s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So it's not a standalone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5777.5s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So example, writing on the computer, for example, using a slideshow to present a science project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5783.598s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Tech teachers had to teach proficiently with keyboards for MCAS, use it throughout the day, and now extremely important that everyone has a Chromebook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5792.763s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So member Graham asked about a new curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5798.186s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5798.386s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Layden said, I don't think so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5799.807s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So this year and last year, we have supported staff and students how to use Google Classrooms, emails, online research tools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5807.371s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Some of those things will continue to evolve depending on needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5811.073s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: More a skill set than a set curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5820.214s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5820.434s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Layden talked about the influx of tech funding, which of course was a positive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5826.637s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I asked about how do we support our classroom teachers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5829.838s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Are we doing enough to support our teachers in areas they don't feel comfortable with Google Classroom, et cetera?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5837.382s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5837.582s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Layden responded that library and tech teachers work hand in hand with classmates, teachers reinforcing and assisting when needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5850.468s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Again, she went back and talked about the library staff is stretched thin and this of course has ramifications for what they can accomplish.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5861.915s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I would sum that up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5866.061s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I asked about the other things that we need as a committee to be aware of for budget requests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5872.784s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And she said, the ordered Chrome tables for kindergarten finally arrived, as did the document cameras for teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5879.808s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So those were very delayed in arriving, but they're finally here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5883.85s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Instructional labs will need upgrading for coding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5887.712s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We would look to build in a replacement budget for the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5893.618s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, the next presentation was by Dr. Riccadeli, who spoke to us about the world language curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5902.624s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Much of this discussion really focused on the middle school level and whether French should be added as an option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5913.571s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There's a great deal of interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5915.333s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think one of the points which,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5917.87s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I saw some level of where it wasn't fully decided as Dr. Riccadeli was suggesting that it would start off with grade six next year to offer French.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5931.359s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She suggested that we have staff who's already able to speak French, but I know that there was also expressed by member Graham, any interest in having that extended at least into grade seven and possibly grade eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5949.025s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We adjourned at 530.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6705.305s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I always think that we had a discussion about sort of two different things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6710.168s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: One was the front entrance and doing that with a sign and nice, as our community member presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6720.793s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The other was the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6725.986s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: looking into a banner that might go along the whole front of the building, just to be, add a little bit more sparkle, if you would, a little bit more, you know, interest in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6739.869s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't think right now we were getting to the point where it was just final, this is what we would do, but because there were cost concerns, like how much is a banner?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6749.03s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that the, you know, from my point of view, I was definitely interested in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6753.991s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: making the front of the school clear, clear cut, name, nice, whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6760.254s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But if the banner is a not too expensive way of also bringing some excitement to the building, I think we should look into it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6772.54s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So just to get a price.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=6773.46s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, just to get a price, just to have an understanding of what we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=7006.089s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, there were four altogether.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=7008.95s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The first one I'm going to read has to do with MCAS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=7013.35s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It was submitted by Eileen Manziel of 42 Winter Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=7017.791s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She writes, question, what are the new dates for MCAS testing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=7021.772s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Are parents still able to opt out their child children if they so choose?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=7026.153s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Sincerely, Eileen Manziel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=7156.892s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Galusi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=7158.487s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Next email, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=7161.188s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So there are three more emails regarding the Columbus School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=7167.69s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor, do you wish me to read them now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=7185.954s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=7189.083s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: what your preference is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=7190.803s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=7192.164s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So, and I'll keep on checking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=7194.584s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much, Member Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=8456.784s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=8457.724s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, Member Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=8459.145s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I do need to let you know that we received a letter on this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=8463.927s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I can hold it until the presentation, if that would be preferable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=10547.781s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: No, I just, these were just great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=10550.583s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I really, really liked seeing them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12318.142s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12320.102s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12321.083s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Please let me know if my audio starts going bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12323.803s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I noted tonight we've had more audio problems than usual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12327.264s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So let me know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12328.224s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I am reading, received a letter to the school committee account from a parent, Adrianne Preby.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12337.166s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm going to paraphrase it since many of the things were answered, but I think it's important for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12342.608s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: you to hear her viewpoint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12344.769s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She says, my name is Adrienne Preby of 61 Locust Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12348.492s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I sent this to school administrators but did not receive a reply, so I'm sending it here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12353.075s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The decision to take away a family's choice in switching back and forth from hybrid to remote as they feel is safest for them due to the ever-shifting nature of COVID case counts as a clear breach of trust of families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12365.124s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: How exactly do you intend to enforce this policy after March 18th?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12370.037s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She does ask whether we have considered asking a waiver.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12374.078s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think most importantly, though, the thing I want to mention is she says, additionally, all communications about this new policy only add that families will be able to remain fully remote as an afterthought, barely emphasizing this crucial fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12391.621s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And she feels that this is trying to pressure families into choosing the in-person learning model.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12396.178s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm not certain, I don't, I know what exactly, you know, whether that was the last thing said or the first, but I just wanna make it clear that to parents that they can choose the remote model and we're anticipating that they could stay in the remote model to the end of this year, is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12419.68s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12476.84s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, so I really think that what she's saying is that because maybe in our communication, she saw the emphasis on yes, you can stay fully remote as maybe not front and center at the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12551.005s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm just relaying that the parent feels that this change is not something she's happy with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12557.628s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And she did not feel that it was emphasized that she could stay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12561.169s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That's all I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12563.43s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's not a point of- Her words, not mine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13074.543s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member van de Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13076.144s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13076.404s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So the question is, um, uh, I think this is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13080.207s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Uh, I'd like to be able to wave them all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13083.229s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: What's the financial impact and how are we going to cover the loss?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13145.673s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, that's, that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13150.836s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I make a motion to approve the recommendation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13450.674s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So first, I do want to, we held off some letters from the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13456.098s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I do want to comment on those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13458.579s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: However, before I read those, I'm just going to say, I understood the purposes of putting the, that member Rousseau told me was that his purpose was to send his resolution to the committee of the whole on Wednesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13471.407s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I submitted mine as well, so that it would go to the committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13476.68s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Resolutions that are put forth just to explain to our viewers are to work out, hammer out a procedure for an advisory council and also a timeline for the renaming of the Columbus School, which was voted on back in June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13497.255s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: They are very lengthy because there are many important issues in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13504.528s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: in the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13505.789s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So my intent was that it was not going to be discussed line by line tonight, but that I wanted everybody to get a chance to see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13514.814s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I do have great concerns about the timing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13517.696s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mentioned that tonight, but I'm sure we'll be talking about that on Wednesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13522.678s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, we received some letters regarding the Columbus issue<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13530.709s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm going to, the first one received was from Betsy Lister and long time resident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13547.157s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I thought I saw Betsy on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13548.858s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She actually did not put her address on here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13552.1s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is Betsy on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13558.994s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She is a long time, four decades, Medford resident, a business owner in town for over 20 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13575.958s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Vidikul, how many emails do you have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13579.059s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think there's three now, but another one on a different topic has come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13586.882s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, to all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13588.223s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I've been a long time, four decades, Medford resident, business owner in town for over 28 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13593.046s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm a past president of what was known as the Salem Street Business Association for three years, a past board member of Temple Shalom here in the city, and my son went to the Columbus School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13603.672s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The direction I see the city going in is one that will hold terrible consequences for the children and grandchildren of future generations,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13610.956s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13611.997s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This Marxist-communistic leftist agenda that's being forced down the throats of parents and children is heinous, contains so much hatred and racial divide, it's out and outright despicable and has no business in the city, never mind the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13627.151s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Why on earth are children not being taught the important things that will get them through life?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13631.455s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Why are they being indoctrinated into a narrative that's full of hate and divides people by color and social status?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13637.58s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Why are they being taught about BLM and Antifa?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13641.181s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Why not teach them our history as it happens so that they will know not to repeat it in the future to be learning from the past?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13647.903s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: All men are created equal, says the Constitution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13651.524s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's what we should be taught in school, period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13654.545s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Not divide by skin color or ethnic background.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13656.965s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: They are all children and children love unless they are taught otherwise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13660.706s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And teaching hatred in school has no business<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13664.653s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: being there at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13665.773s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Teach the children they are all equal and to love one another and their neighbors, not to put a line of division between themselves and others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13673.135s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm disgusted with the new rev, that and they all need to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13676.696s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: In fact, I'm thinking the entire school committee needs to be dissolved immediately because it's harming the children by dividing the community unnecessarily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13684.278s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We're better than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13685.459s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I doubt that the majority of Medford parents want their children brought up with Marxist beliefs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13690.2s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We already know that academia consists of 98% liberals and the rest conservatives, so that should be addressed as well so that children's minds are not poisoned any further.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13699.488s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's a very long letter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13703.511s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Sorry, that was my own comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13705.512s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Recently, I heard an audio clip of an eighth grade class with their teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13708.815s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: He asked them if they knew who Helen Keller was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13711.257s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The response ranged from a man and a German spy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13714.72s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Only one child in the entire classroom said, oh, that was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13718.792s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: that blind person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13719.873s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: By the way, she's not referring to a Medford classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13723.476s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The teacher then required if any of the children knew who Hitler was and they were clueless, no idea, and couldn't respond at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13730.142s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Imagine not knowing who Hitler was in the eighth grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13733.245s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And finally, he asked, do you know what D-Day is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13736.949s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And the answer was a rapper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13739.022s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Think about that for a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13740.462s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: What are our kids being taught?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13742.183s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Items of importance or a leftist Marxist agenda?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13745.804s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not a perfect person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13747.145s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I've sinned in my life and I have enough sense to know what I'm seeing being pushed through in Medford schools is just wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13753.066s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And although I'm not a Christian, I believe that most parents would agree that what's being taught in the Medford school system doesn't go along with their Christian or Judaic values.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13761.929s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Seems the leftist took God out of the schools to shame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13766.348s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And as for the Columbus School renaming goes, there's no reason at all to change the name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13770.23s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I know Andrea Bocelli is quite the performer, but he means nothing to me at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13774.411s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Nor do I think who he is makes any sense to plaster his name on an educational building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13778.693s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This is not Disney, nor is it Hollywood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13780.414s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And the name Columbus has served the school very well for decades upon decades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13784.276s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: For all of his sins, he's the reason most of us are here for crying out loud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13787.517s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This is the senseless and waste our time and poses a distraction to the real issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13792.079s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: What's being taught to the children in the direction that the city is going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13796.854s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We have elected a mayor who has turned her back on the people who elected her and chooses to do her personal bidding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13805.821s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13807.602s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, there's a level of, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13813.878s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Not on our own political stance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13815.26s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Take a knee for BLM, but do not support your own police.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13818.342s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Hmm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13819.403s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: How many want to see this divide that's happening?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13821.445s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I doubt not the majority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13822.666s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Hell, if I'm wrong, let me know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13824.228s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I was the support the police rally, and when you have children screaming, blank the police, and creating a scene and spewing hatred everywhere, it was disgusting, and everybody was shocked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13835.078s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: These were schoolchildren telling us to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13838.075s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: yeah, and ourselves and the police and worse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13840.88s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I got hit off the head with a sign by a teenager who teaches these kids this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13846.73s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Common sense has left the city and needs to be brought back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13850.222s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If we don't teach our true history as it was, the kids will go back thinking D-Day is a rapper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13855.406s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Stop destroying the city's monuments and institutions by bringing a divide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13859.63s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Rather instead, take a step back and start trying to love one another and want better for our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13864.433s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And stop this absolute nonsense and pay attention to what the kids are being taught and worry about their future as opposed to the name of the building of where they get their education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13873.541s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Sign me more than mad in Medford that it's come to this juncture, Betsy Lister.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13881.024s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: OK, so that's the first letter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13883.425s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yep, two more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13886.405s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The second letter on this topic comes from Medford United and Eunice Brown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13896.148s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And she's transmitted to us a packet of information<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13902.341s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So it says, dear May Lungo current school committee members and superintendent Edouard-Vincent, as concerned citizens of Medford, Massachusetts, we submit the documentation to support our position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13913.946s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The name of the Columbus school should remain unchanged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13916.987s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We strongly believe in the proposed name, believe the proposed name change is unnecessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13922.63s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This packet includes several components, this cover letter, a hard copy of the petition description that was circulated,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13931.684s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: online and hard copy petitions that have been signed by current and former Medford residents who oppose the name change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13938.329s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Total signatures 2,100.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13940.471s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Medford residents signatures 650 plus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13945.574s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Differential in signatures, individuals who may not currently resign in Medford, but who have grown up in the city and who continue to have family ties or business interests in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13956.553s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Regarding the handwritten sheets of petitions collected, in some case, the signer signed for him or herself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13961.397s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: In other cases, written permission was received to sign for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13965.2s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That is why you will see signatures with the same handwriting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13969.664s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: One petition site that we use required that we email the URL to the results to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13974.008s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That is the GO petition site, and that was the most recent petition circled and has thus far netted us 21 names, 15 of which are Medford residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13983.8s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Those results will be sent email to the official school committee email.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13988.041s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Information regarding Christopher Columbus is point number four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13993.963s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that must be in the packet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13996.843s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Number five, information regarding the Italian-American alliance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14000.664s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We believe that it is a strong sampling of the true sentiments of the Medford community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14005.105s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We want our voices to be heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14006.566s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It is disturbing that such a monumental decision that changes the fabric of our city<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14011.297s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: was decided with a sheer lack of transparency and community input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14015.341s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: A decision of this magnitude should have been advertised far and wide across all media platforms and far in advance of a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14022.887s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It should not have been<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14024.398s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: advertised only to meet the letter of the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14027.381s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This is unconscionable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14028.982s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We are deeply disappointed that any steps taken to move forward on this matter are considered ethnically biased, disrespectful, and thoughtless, insulting multiple generations of Italian-Americans who grew up, lived in, attended, and supported and contributed to the Columbus School as well as the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14047.008s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: For Italian Americans, this school name has and will always be a source of pride and history.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14052.581s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This is a passionate and personal issue for many on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14056.039s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: on both sides and with other urgent matters much higher on the priority list that our city is facing, we are putting forth our best efforts to stop the Medford School Committee from changing the name of the Columbus School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14068.364s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: On Friday, March 5th, Educational Commissioner Riley ordered all elementary school students must return to in-person learning effective April 5th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14076.147s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This should be the school committee's only priority at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14079.809s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: To quote a school committee member and their,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14083.345s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And there is a budget, quite possibly the most contentious budget ever, that we will be attempting to craft at the same time as replanning this year and planning next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14093.909s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It would be a gross abdication of responsibility to the children of Medford to spend time right now on the renaming of a school<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14100.834s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: when issues directly related to the well-being of our children are smack in front of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14105.538s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We request that our discussion regarding changing the name of the Columbus School be tabled at this time until our children have returned to school safely for the remainder of the academic year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14115.846s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Budget issues are managed and there is a plan in place to return our children to the academic year 21-22.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14122.732s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you for your consideration, sincerely concerned citizens of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14128.356s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And then I have one more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14132.758s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: on this subject.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14133.559s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This was submitted by Brenna Christensen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14139.104s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Dear Mayor Lungo-Koehn and members of the Medford School Committee, my name is Brenna Christensen and I am a graduate of the class of 2020 from Medford High School and a former captain of the varsity softball team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14152.336s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I write to you today to request a name change to Columbus Memorial Park<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14157.793s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: the Crystal Campbell Field and to incorporate the name changing of the field to the future name change committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14165.837s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So she's recommending that we change the name of the Columbus School to the Crystal Campbell School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14172.519s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Crystal Campbell was a Medford native, a victim of the Boston Marathon bombings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14177.282s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She was an active member in our Mustang community and was in the band along with the softball team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14182.484s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Crystal Campbell was known to light up any room she walked into and she loved sunflowers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14187.972s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She is an inspiration to our city, our home, our residents, and our athletes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14192.853s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Since 2013, the varsity softball team has held the Crystal Campbell Softball Tournament in mid-April at the Columbus Park Softball Field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14201.455s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: During the two-day tournament, us Mustangs competed against Boricua, Swampscott, and Arlington Catholic High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14207.817s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We actively fundraised during the tournament and throughout our season to donate to the Crystal Campbell Scholarship Fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14215.046s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: On this day, our community comes together as one and united.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14219.672s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We are truly Medford strong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14221.634s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Although this tournament may only be two days out of the year, during our entire season, we wear her name on our jersey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14228.622s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And we wear it with immense pride.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14230.525s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's a day when we give back to the community and honor Crystal's legacy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14235.089s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Not only is the Columbus Park field home to our high school Mustang softball team, we share this field with our youth softball program and baseball as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14243.675s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We meet our forever friends, learn sportsmanship along with the importance of responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14248.699s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But for all of that, we make memories that will last a lifetime.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14251.901s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Each and every play on that field, we keep crystal close to our hearts and play in our honor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14256.485s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I respectfully ask that we use our Medford strength, come together as one and rename our fields.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14261.618s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Let's continue the pride we feel when we wear Campbell on our jerseys and with a positive change to our city, the city we all love and with gratitude get to call home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14270.304s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14270.684s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Kind regards, Brenda Christensen, 80 Fern Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14275.307s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So excuse me, she may be asking just for the fields to carry the name and we would do that under a separate consideration, but we might forward her email to the advisory council anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14310.09s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, can I just, there's a curriculum subcommittee meeting from 4 to 5.30.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14314.092s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think originally people thought this meeting, our Committee of the Whole was going to be at 5.30, so just to repeat, it starts at 5.45.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=14322.814s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15015.584s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, so the one thing I just want to say is that the resolution that I'm sending to the Committee of the Whole talks about timeline as does Member Ruseau's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15033.494s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This is quite separate from and different from discussing the key issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15038.237s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We've already made a decision that the school would be renamed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15041.579s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I understand that there are very<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15044.502s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: feelings about this and I certainly understand that there are people who are very angry about the process that was used right at the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15053.95s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: In terms of the timing and us concentrating on what we need to, it was my intent after spending a great deal of time working out the potential for the advisory council to discuss the timeline<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15071.583s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: with the committee at that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15073.445s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: To do so tonight without having reviewed the resolutions just simply won't make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15080.49s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It'll be random.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15081.431s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So while I appreciate hearing from my former colleague, the intent was to send the resolution to the subcommittee to discuss timelines and processes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15723.726s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I referenced this earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15726.428s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I very much in good faith went through the process of looking in detail with thanks to my colleague who I used his as a basis to work through all of the issues that I think the advisory council has.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15744.72s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Who's going to be on the advisory council?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15746.881s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: What are they going to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15748.302s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: How are they going to report it out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15750.183s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Who's going to pick the names, et cetera?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15753.951s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15755.672s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: My concern is having done that exercise is while in it, I kept the dates except for one week of that Paul had originally put in his, I don't think it's real.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15772.403s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just don't think there's enough time to have a good reflective process, a thorough process for the advisory council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15785.959s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not saying that we should overturn our decision about Columbus, which I know many in the community would like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15793.463s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: For me, the most important thing is to try and figure a path forward, which brings us unity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15800.747s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Earlier this evening, we heard those voices of our kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15804.669s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And as I was listening to the voices of our kids, I was thinking about this discussion that we were gonna have here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15811.877s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: which has been feeling such division.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15816.779s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And in our kids, we hear the hope and the desire for unity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15823.062s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that the advisory council needs time to do its job well and not rushed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15830.286s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: As I've gotten older, I have more and more of appreciation for that word reflection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15836.209s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, getting a chance to think about what we're doing and what name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15843.444s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I have put in mind a chance for a public hearing, not to debate the issue of Columbus, but to look at the new names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15854.173s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: All along, I've been hopeful that we could come up with something that would honor our Italian heritage in this community, but also bring the community together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15865.262s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We're not gonna do that fast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15866.944s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's not a slam dunk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15869.193s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I know that there's much pain with the thought of even prolonging the process a minute longer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15875.456s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I know that I don't really want it to go through this for month after month, but I am very, very concerned that in our short term, we do have a lot to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15887.341s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: My feeling is, and again, we can go through, I think going through the process of looking at the process outlined for the advisory council is instructive in terms of saying, whoa, what are you doing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15899.631s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: How are we gonna set this advisory council together?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15901.873s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So that it is really a strong and works to bring the community together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15910.56s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Anyway, that's my two cents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15911.841s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I expected to have this discussion on Wednesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=237.88s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=244.442s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Just so you know, you can ask either member to do that as secretary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=329.584s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You just might mention the cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=778.843s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=780.224s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The mayor has her hand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=782.706s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And there we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=783.987s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So if you'd let her go first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=808.083s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=809.244s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So just, Kathy, may I?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=812.046s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, you may.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=812.667s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=813.527s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: To be clear then, is the money for this generator, has it already been appropriated or has it not been appropriated?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=838.34s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So right now, while this generator has not been operationable, we're just running off of one generator?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=846.746s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The other generator is what I understand?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=889.887s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: John, the other day when I went up to attend the Haitian dance class, which was really fun, it was so hot in the gym.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=901.616s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Does that have something to do with the generator or that's just a completely different issue?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=992.34s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, but the generator, and Kathy, there was actually two bills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=996.963s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There were two different bills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=998.944s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: One was for about 120 something, and the other one was for about 58, if I recall, that you sent out to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1005.088s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So is it the combination of those two bills that you're saying we need?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1011.352s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So 180, roughly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1020.035s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: No, it's 128 plus 58, I think, right, Kathy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1022.976s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1023.376s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I mean, so we're talking, you know, 130 plus 60.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1027.278s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: In a budget which is going to be tight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1041.671s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And now am I hearing that this is an emergency?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1046.834s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, to get through next year, is that what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1054.319s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Was this in our former capital plan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1086.48s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But what you're saying is we need to come up with roughly 200K to get this generator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1547.572s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I would second that motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1554.295s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: On that motion, Paul Rousseau?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1556.376s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1557.977s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Paulette Van der Kloot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1559.318s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1560.038s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Kathy Kreatz?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1561.038s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1795.708s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Not this time around, but last time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1853.115s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1953.515s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: HAB-Masyn Moyer-Moyer): So Kathy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1954.677s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1955.258s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: While you work on that one of the questions you had up is an important one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1959.023s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: HAB-Masyn Moyer-Moyer): And HAB-Masyn Moyer-Moyer): ADA compliant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1964.431s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: HAB-Masyn Moyer-Moyer): Can can vehicle still drive on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=1967.636s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2049.302s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So Kathy Mayer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2052.403s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I know that for ADA, it's, I think if I recall, it's one inch per foot or something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2059.904s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There's a very prescribed amount that the rise happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2063.885s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's a very gradual rise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2066.743s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is there enough room to, and if you think about, you know, the actual ramp that's there, you know, it goes back and forth in order to accommodate that very gentle slope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2080.529s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Looking at the front of the school at the ramp that we're talking about, which I express great concerns about the safety of on many occasions,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2090.274s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But is there enough rise to make it into an ADA?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2093.86s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is there enough room to create the rise, that gentle slope to make it into ADA compliant?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2102.333s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, I would, I would.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2167.101s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2398.994s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Cha-ching, cha-ching.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2757.351s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2758.132s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So, Kathy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2760.835s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Go ahead, Mr. Antiquity just wants to chime in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2763.598s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2768.494s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So anyway, the concern I have is, you know, as soon as we start just the discussion around the ADA compliance, it does get very expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2779.642s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And the question now is, you know, again, that vision committee hasn't gotten off the ground yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2786.347s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, how much money<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2788.725s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Are we going to, we all agree that some level of upgrade would be nice just to make it look better right away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2796.987s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I've brought a safety concern with the current configuration saying, look, do we put a handrail in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2806.79s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Can a truck still use it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2808.451s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But I understand it's not ADA compliant, that particular ramp, but we've always used the other ramp<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2817.004s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If, you know, right now, I think that there's a question of, I mean, we just have to be mindful of the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2822.265s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, there was another drawing you shared with us today, just with the Mustang and welcome Mustangs, whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2829.826s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I, you know, I'm really, of course, I would love it to be officially ADA compliant throughout every ramp, but I'm just wondering whether we really have the money to go down that route right now and how much money<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2846.208s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: do we want to invest?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2849.109s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, I loved Klaus's drawings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2851.529s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I absolutely loved them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2852.889s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And that obviously is, you know, just gets you excited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2856.87s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But there is a trade-off between how much we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2860.991s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm kind of on the fence about that right now when I think about what financial picture we face in the very short term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=2952.99s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Dave has his hand up, Kathy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3110.322s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Kathy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3112.143s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There was another photo that you shared with us, and it had the picture of the horse and blue columns on the outside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3123.132s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It was really a cosmetic upgrade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3129.057s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I had seen that picture when you sent it to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3133.6s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: that did not look like that was part of a very large or structural.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3140.802s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It wasn't part of a structural upgrade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3142.762s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It was part of a cosmetic upgrade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3145.623s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I wondered, that was the first time that I remember seeing that particular photo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3150.084s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know, don't remember that being as part of Klaus's, I'm not sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3154.505s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So can you-<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3232.627s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, just so that you know what we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3944.239s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3944.479s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Vandeku?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3945.72s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3946.22s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I would like to make a motion that we ask central administration to explore the costs by talking to Mr. Fallon and other people who might have some expertise in this area to how much it would be to pursue the concept of Mr. Dunovan, which we see as it's a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3970.525s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, it's not a whole redo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3972.066s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm getting off here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3973.427s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I should just make that, you know, but how much that would cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3977.449s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And also, I'd like to also ask that we explore the idea of the banner in the front.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3983.832s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't see them as mutually, you know, one or the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3987.554s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think both have great potential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3990.316s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I really love marking the door with a little bit more excitement, and I love having a canvas, especially if we have our students input<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=3997.7s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: into what sort of things we might include on that, how to make it bright.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=4002.602s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'd love to know what the costs are associated with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=4006.703s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So Peter, if you would, you might give direction to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=4010.405s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: To make my resolution more compact, that we explore the costs of the front entranceway and possibly a banner for the front side of the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=4035.935s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zMDmsK0LIsU&t=4823.954s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=923.46s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, you're done, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=925.381s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=927.562s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just have to say that this is really an outstanding review for a new superintendent, or a still newish superintendent, if you would.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=939.106s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That not one of the numbers is lower than a three, and most of them are 3.5 or higher is just truly remarkable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=951.07s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So, you know, the overall picture that we see here is of a very strong performance by the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=960.297s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: For the sake of the audience, I just want to mention that it's a numbers we were reading was a score.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=966.745s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: each of the committee members rated the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=970.888s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: One was the lowest rating that she could receive in an area and four was the highest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=976.751s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And we could differentiate by doing a 3.5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=980.834s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But what you're seeing is that in all areas, the superintendent<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=986.937s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: had a very strong showing where not only the majority of the committee, but the whole committee thought that she was doing work of three or higher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=998.542s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Remembering 4.0 is the very highest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1003.123s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And we saw the breakdown of the sheets in some areas, people gave her fours completely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1010.766s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, we did it a little bit differently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1014.548s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: In the future, I'd like to spend a little bit more time talking through each of the areas with my fellow committee members, just so that we're all sure that we're rating the particular item in the correct way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1028.053s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But again, really, congratulations, Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1031.814s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I have to say this is a very, very strong showing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1034.895s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think that when you opened it up today, we must have seen that that smile must have lit up your office for sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1248.186s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1251.947s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We always did them in public or we did a, you know, spoke about our evaluations in public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1260.51s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Then they were given to the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1264.051s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I would assume that it's just a public,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=1266.813s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, paper, which is available to the public, but I don't know how we want to post it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=2033.076s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, we probably should.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=2035.958s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=2041.521s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=2042.822s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's because it's a committee of the whole, not a subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=2045.223s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But yes, usually we would move something from the committee of the whole to the regular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=2160.086s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZRb63TV1uM&t=2189.065s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=5.575s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, Tom, congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=7.875s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Congratulations, Tom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=5015.775s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=5894.608s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You didn't call my name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6015.139s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6016.159s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Van der Kloot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6018.739s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Through you, through the chair,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6022.334s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: First, I want to thank the committee for laying this out and Paul for the work you were doing on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6028.496s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it's an excellent working document to have at our disposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6034.597s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The one thing I wasn't certain if I saw, and I could be terribly wrong, but I didn't see super, I saw goals, but superintendent's evaluation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6117.701s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I saw district goals, but I didn't see any specificity around self-evaluation or, you know, that that would be part of what the school committee can expect on an annual basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6181.959s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, we receive, if I may, we receive from the superintendent her, and we need to expect to receive the self-evaluation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6194.03s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yep, yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6198.059s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Right, so that's, again, and I'm thinking as if I were a new member looking at this, that if it was put on that, oh yeah, one of the things I'm gonna get is the superintendent's evaluation, and that's gonna start the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6212.106s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So in my mind, I think it's appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6216.748s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Of course, I understand the committee deliberated it a long time, but that was my question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6221.61s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Again, the other, I think you did a great job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6239.412s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6241.613s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6567.092s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There are no emails today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6568.894s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I do want to mention that there is a curriculum subcommittee from 4 to 5.30 this Wednesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6575.978s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We're going to be going back to what was on the agenda for a meeting that was canceled, had to do with our world language program<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=6587.008s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: and also technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=8154.207s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess to that point, is the orchestra playing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=8279.278s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10074.404s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I just wanted to thank Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10077.386s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Nunley for her presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10079.747s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I was curious, Alicia, could you send this to us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10085.491s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Because there was a lot in it and a few things I'd really like to go back and take a look at more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10091.715s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So again, appreciate the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10093.656s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Please send it to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10629.411s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, well, Mr. Murphy just referenced this, but, and he said it would not necessarily solve the problem, but I can't, in order to address some of my colleagues' concerns, can we post where we have our budget, a page explaining additional funding was coming from the supplemental, and then, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10654.454s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, doing the addition or whatever and the final number, just to make it clear and to keep track.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10664.317s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10664.778s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If you could do that, I think that that would at least be a start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=10689.095s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So clearly what you're expressing to us is it's a fluid situation so that when you post it, you can post it with that caveat as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11989.486s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, again, I'd like to thank Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=11991.688s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Nunley, and I'd like to make a motion to accept their report and put it on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12006.127s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We did, well, we received the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12013.852s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, and in our conversation, I did ask Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12016.833s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Nunley to send it to us, which I trust she will, but it is typical that you receive a report and place it on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12025.699s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So, I don't have any reason to...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12030.437s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: not think that this presentation then counts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12034.079s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Paul, it's the way that you move on the conversation when we don't have another motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12044.505s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This is the way that we end the discussion and move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12070.587s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I'll make the motion to say, I mean, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12074.129s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Nunley already said to me that she was going to supply to us, but I make a motion that the director, the city director of finance supply to the school committee, a copy of her report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12280.908s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes so first I want to thank my colleague Melanie McLaughlin for bringing this to our attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12286.75s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I know there was a phone call<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12288.606s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: a couple of days afterwards and I know I was on it and Melanie was on it and in fact took a, you know, participated and Dr. Edouard-Vincent was on it as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12301.33s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that probably really helped that you both were there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12306.491s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I just, I don't know exactly, is there a dollar amount attached to this or is it more in terms of hours of training or how is it stipulated?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12319.348s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12320.309s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, sorry, Dr. Edouard-Vincent, and then member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12379.777s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: No, I'm done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nnsRDJfWfaQ&t=12380.861s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4118.939s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4164.808s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, there's one that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4167.894s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: is separate from the rest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4170.436s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's from Cynthia Kinnan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4172.758s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Cynthia lives at 156 George Street, and she has given me permission to paraphrase it and stick to main points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4183.848s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She writes, I want to express that I see a full return to in-person school or failing that a fully in-person option for all students next year as vital.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4196.768s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: As a parent and an economist, I've been following the research on the consequences of disrupted schooling for both children and parents, and I find them very concerning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4205.235s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: While the evidence on the possibility of safe return to school from a public health perspective is quite promising.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4212.201s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Columbus, where my son is in kindergarten and has done a terrific job under extremely tough circumstances, as has the district as a whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4220.929s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The weekly COVID testing program is wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4223.879s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Nonetheless, hybrid rather than fully in-person school has been very challenging for our family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4231.043s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Of course, teacher and student safety is paramount for the return to fully in-person school next fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4236.907s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I would appreciate guidance from the school district on what I and other parents can do now and going forward to help ensure the conditions are in place for a full return to in-person school in the fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4248.613s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I hope that by furthering this conversation now, we can make sure<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4252.031s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: that there is time to get the necessary funding and resources in place for next fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4258.374s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor, there are also many letters pertaining to the Columbus School discussion, which is later on in our agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=4267.979s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So perhaps we should save them to that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=5059.147s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: What's the date?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=6338.905s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=6339.966s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to mention how wonderful it was to have the opportunity to join in the middle school assembly this past week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=6348.312s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Frankly, you know, as a school committee member, one of the great joys is to be able to see our students in action and when we've been all<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=6357.807s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: On Zoom, that's been harder to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=6359.308s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So bringing us this assembly, getting to see our kids and a lot of them, it was just great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=6365.232s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you and thanks to all the students and of course to their leadership, Mr. Skorka, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=6370.175s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Olson, Mr. Trotta and everybody else who's involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=6374.097s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's something that makes us feel very proud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=7005.09s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9470.389s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to let my fellow committee members know that both the mayor and I, the superintendent, Mr. Murphy, Mr. Cushing, were<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9483.003s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think I've got everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9483.983s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We're in attendance at the request of Pat Jalen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9487.424s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I was invited as vice chair to represent the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9492.186s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And Pat had set up, excuse me, Senator Jalen had set up a Zoom call with DESE, their finance people to talk about the impact of the charter school tuitions on our budget, which is extreme.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9509.831s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The mayor alluded to the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9511.751s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: approximately $1 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9513.432s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: In truth, it becomes even more than that, closer to a million and a quarter when something else is factored in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9520.958s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's very clear that the people we were talking about were budget people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9525.041s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's their job to simply implement the formula and not to do anything about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9531.406s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Our entire delegation was there, Senator Jayland, Representatives Donato, Garbley, and Barber.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9540.892s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Paul Donato spoke to the fact that last year, we also sort of fell into this little pit where our funding was lower and they had put together some legislation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9553.919s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: When we spoke, and I was quite adamant about the impact of how starting with a million and a quarter blow,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9564.777s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: in our funding would impact us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9567.439s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There's some discussion about what the legislators have to do to try and help us with this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9574.323s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Right now, though, the reality of it is, is the way the funding formula works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9579.006s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We really get sucker punched.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9581.148s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And our delegation is totally aware and totally desirous of being helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9590.874s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It may be advantageous for us to invite them to a committee meeting at some point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9596.818s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: with a follow-up and talk about what other options, what can we do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9602.922s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Because right now, I mean, you know, it's a real issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9852.758s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9856.974s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=9857.655s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is there a role for the school committee in being able to attend any of the sessions or how is that envisioned?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10516.409s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, no, I just wanted to second it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10518.33s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I didn't know if anybody had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10590.312s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor, I feel like that I need to convey to the committee, and I'm sure many committee members know because we've received so many emails to our personal accounts, but there were many submitted to the school committee account as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10606.743s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We had roughly 30 letters<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10611.146s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: all of which were similar, saying to us, please don't continue this discussion, don't change the name, and suggesting that this was the wrong time and the timing would distract us from other work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10626.646s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The letters were similar, so I know that committee members have seen them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10630.95s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If I were to read them all, it would take several hours of our time right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10636.235s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Conversely, we also received almost an equal number supporting the name change with people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10645.184s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The letters were a little bit more different, more,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10648.907s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: diverse in their discussions, but again asking that we do keep to our intent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10656.81s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There was one submitted I want to mention in particular by a third grade student who also asked us please to keep to our intent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10669.514s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So clearly people thought that we might be changing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10672.815s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There was also a petition submitted by Medford United<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10677.576s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it is appropriate for me to just read this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10681.217s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It says please join Medford Mass residents in signing this petition requesting the Medford Mass School Committee and it names us immediately rescind their vote to change the name of the Columbus Elementary School in operation since 1929.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10694.881s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The name change was approved without community input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10697.91s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Community input and transparency should be sought before major decisions are made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10702.433s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Please sign the petition so we may right this wrong and be the vibrant community we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10707.517s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There were 395 Medford residents on this, but more than, and with 1,426 additional names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10710.579s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: On this,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10719.533s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It is our custom to ask for addresses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10722.557s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It was just signed with names on the emails I was receiving, you know, I don't think people are necessarily clear all the times that they're supposed to have their address as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10732.77s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I started writing back to people, but frankly, there were so many kind of got out of hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10737.609s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: All of these will be submitted to be part of the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10741.694s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll work with Susie on that tomorrow so that we're sure that they're read into the record or they're written into the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10750.513s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think at this point, what I hear your intent is that we're gonna go ahead with the meeting we have, but I do want you to, I wanted to present both the pro and the con and the very deep feelings that people have both ways, very deep feeling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10771.713s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And if I can interject a personal note,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10775.437s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The question is in this very difficult discussion for in our community because it is and has been divisive is how can we come together in a positive way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10786.83s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And that is my deepest hope is that we will find a way to find some common language and common desire around this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=10797.165s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: so that, in fact, it doesn't divide us, but it brings us together in celebration of a rich Italian culture, which maybe isn't defined by the name Columbus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11107.816s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I guess one of the things which I'm wondering is if there's a way, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11116.948s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: we need some help, I think, bringing our community together on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11122.131s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And, you know, I think it's deeply painful to see such a large rift and people on both sides, you know, obviously very committed, but I don't see yet, you know, I don't see a bridge forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11138.979s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And if anybody, you know, I'm wondering whether there's any sort of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11146.808s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: any steps we can take, and if any community members have some thoughts in this of how we can help bridge this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11157.554s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I know that many people have suggested that we understand the Italian community's concern about losing a landmark that is important to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11171.401s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so many of us,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11175.168s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, there's so many different names that could possibly be considered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11180.551s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If we were to not only, you know, to think about it in a broader sense as an opportunity,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11188.234s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, I personally feel it's extremely important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11192.897s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I know when I first came to Medford, I found myself delightfully surrounded in a neighborhood where, you know, by a wonderful warm Italian family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11205.907s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: who took us in, who was so valuable to my own adjustment to Medford, and where I learned about gravy rather than sauce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11214.972s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm just wondering, again, whether there's a, people are very strongly feeling they're negative about taking away Columbus, but I just wanna, is there any potential of going forward and thinking about, is there any place where we might move towards honoring<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11234.95s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: our Italian heritage in this community with a different name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11241.834s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just want to throw that out and say, you know, I'm hoping that somebody might start thinking about that in a positive way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11253.161s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: By the way, and the only other thing I did want to mention is we had originally said it was important for our students at the Columbus to be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=11261.926s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I want to make sure we don't forget that piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12403.868s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12406.944s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Excuse me, if I could interrupt for a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12410.225s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I was just made aware of a mistake which I made, and it's important enough to interrupt and say that the person who wrote it to me is correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12422.168s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: What I didn't say was that I also, when we were talking about the Columbus School emails, I also had received several emails from members of the Italian<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12433.231s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: American community who were not in support of the Columbus name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12437.394s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And the person who wrote me said that she did not want people to think that all of residents of the Italian community were of one mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12447.882s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I wanted to make that correction and to be clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12451.585s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Again, we'll give you the email so that everybody can see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12457.169s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm so sorry and appreciate the correction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12748.03s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, actually on this one, I do disagree because I think that we're going to have so many questions around how different things are going to be handled as we're coming out of the pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12761.595s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: However, I will vote along with it if we can add a caveat that we would be informed about the field trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12769.738s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, so that we can follow up with questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12772.799s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: For example,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12774.36s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, does that cover, we were going to have kids going to Hawaii, well, what if, or Italy or whatever, you know, does that mean that that wouldn't be brought before us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12784.488s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It was scheduled in this past, you know, so I'm just, I don't know, a little bit, I do think that there's things that we would particularly want the committee members would particularly be interested, especially since we have a lot of responsibility in this area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12879.917s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So Paul, would you be okay if we just added a sentence that the school committee will be informed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12886.779s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: By email?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12888.159s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, by email prior to- Absolutely, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12892.04s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: A trip taking place?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12894.381s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, that sounds great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12896.201s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Just so we have some opportunity to ask questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12953.424s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So Paul, I would be comfortable with upon approval from the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12962.173s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't, as a school committee member, I don't personally need to do it, but I wanna make sure that there is a check in place because there have been differing circumstances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12974.321s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So if I can add, upon approval by the superintendent, I'm fine with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rbPzEysIPRU&t=12983.247s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=6.635s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=14.279s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You have any scars yet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=275.004s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Would you be coming out and back in public, Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2072.074s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I just wanted to also extend our thanks to Charlene Douglas and to the members of the negotiating team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2080.221s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's a lot of work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2081.242s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It was many hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2082.523s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I remember how many meetings, you know, throughout the summer you guys attended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2088.008s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Sometimes tensions ran high.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2090.288s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But it is certainly great work and our teachers do great work every day, educating our kids, getting them back into school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2098.013s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And Charlene, I personally want to thank you for your leadership and for getting this done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2103.877s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you very much and to your team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2306.538s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm all set mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/trBcPSLOdhU&t=2307.38s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4417.262s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4420.403s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There is one letter from the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4446.617s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So this email, which came in at 3.49 this afternoon, says, hello all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4452.52s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I didn't see it on the posted agenda, but I'm wondering if it is possible to get an update on the status of the formation of a committee to make plans for next steps of the Columbus name change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4463.687s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4464.528s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Submitted by Emma Heffron, 18 Curtis Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4468.211s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If you recall, we actually had a letter last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4471.273s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We did say that would be on, I thought it was going to be on today's agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4476.638s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So perhaps I'd make a motion that we put it on next, at our next meeting's agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4525.328s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I also just wanted to announce that there's a curriculum subcommittee meeting this Wednesday from 4 to 6 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4533.211s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We'll be discussing the global language program as well as technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4539.802s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: One of our members can't come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4541.083s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So if anybody else can, I'd love to have another member present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4545.486s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If you'd let me know you're available, please, I would most appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4553.992s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Four to six Wednesday, this Wednesday, the 27th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4557.254s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=4604.403s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=5261.432s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Shout out, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=6185.597s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We received a letter from a member of the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=6188.617s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This is from Leticia Roca.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=6192.008s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Hello, my name is Leticia Roca of 3610 Mystic Valley Parkway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=6197.369s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I have the following questions regarding the public health updates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=6201.39s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: One, where exactly can we find updated data about the number of staff members and students that have tested positive across the different schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=6210.092s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is this on the school website?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=6212.092s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This was talked about multiple times during these meetings, but I've yet to see this information divulged consistently online in an accessible manner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=6220.989s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Two, Tufts students are returning to campus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=6224.41s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Will you continue to calculate the Medford positivity rate without Tufts tests?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=6228.851s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And where will this updated information be publicized consistently?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=6233.092s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And then three, has it been officially established that families have the option for remote only learning for the rest of this school year until June?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=6243.574s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If yes, where can we find this official statement by the MPS administration?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=6247.995s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Regards, Leticia.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8034.289s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8035.77s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8036.771s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: First, I want to thank you, Mr. DeLiva, for your presentation and Mr. Fallon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8042.554s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: In regards specifically to the Tufts, were there quite a number of students who were interested?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8078.542s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The only thing I wondered is if there was a second student who was particularly interested, and I don't know whether that's the case, but whether we could go back to Tufts and say, hey, we've got another student who's really interested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8090.389s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And if that were being, I'm all hypothetical here, but if there was any thought that there was another student who was a close call, I would certainly encourage you to say, could we go back and ask?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8105.058s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: because there is a certain flexibility too with perhaps making a class of another extra student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8112.223s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I see Dr. Cushing has his hand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8142.532s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, it's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8143.732s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: One can only always want more though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8145.732s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8147.753s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8148.073s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Dr. Cushing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8620.255s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I also appreciated the job description and the intent behind it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=8624.94s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I would second the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10790.353s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member van de Kloot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10792.715s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I just think it's important to mention, since two of my colleagues mentioned that we're sort of late into the year of setting these goals,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10802.285s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is saying that we're so yay late because there's a pandemic and the superintendents was working as many of us noted Earlier around the clock for such a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10812.79s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10813.965s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: so hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10814.585s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just wanted to thank her for all the work that she's done at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=10821.05s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And while I certainly support looking at the goals for another week and revisiting them, I just think it's really, really important to acknowledge all the incredible work the superintendent and her team has done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=11708.93s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Can you restate the motion in our paper?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12369.747s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, so member Rousseau, I'm a little torn here because I can actually see both sides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12376.991s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: However, I don't think that you're correct in saying there's, we're only gonna send it to subcommittee if I'm going to get my way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12384.556s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The whole point of a subcommittee discussion should be an opportunity to get more input, not only from perhaps parents, but also from our educators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12395.002s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The high school graduation has been<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12397.263s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: mentioned multiple times and you know I used to have a really hard time with it because I was like, Jesus, there's a lot of kids in this audience who, you know, they got the flu or they broke their arm or something happened and they couldn't go to school and now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12411.754s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But, you know, again, maybe they're<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12414.796s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: They're finding satisfaction in some other ways, and there may have been kids and I certainly remember, I mean one year there was a year where there was only one kid, but one year there was like five or six and it was amazing that all those kids had really been able to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12432.519s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It is called out at the high school, and it's always by the audience really appreciated and I've always felt kind of funny because I do feel kind of funny about it because I share your concerns about does it does it motivate kids but you know I never knew we gave that award until I went to the high school graduation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12451.752s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I don't know how many kids know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12454.494s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: My kids never talked about it and said, oh boy, I'm not going to get the perfect attendance award because they never, you know, it just wasn't part of their thinking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12462.44s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But anyway, so I totally supported going to subcommittee for the purposes of discussion and input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12468.644s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think that, you know, part of it is to be open-minded and listen to other people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=12475.008s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's what I would be wanting to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=13355.305s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=13407.624s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=13411.145s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=13522.964s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UWldBjHqpes&t=13529.366s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=1616.156s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, um, the thing is that it's changed, it's changed a great deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=1620.758s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I personally don't think that the committee has agreed on the next step and I think we need to that that's would be the focus of mean some uniform way of presenting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=1634.702s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I had thought that the superintendent was going to present to us tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=1639.467s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I didn't know that the expectation was that we would be giving her feedback in writing tonight, at least, or whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=1649.296s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'd be interested in hearing what member Graham has to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=1654.862s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: What her expectations were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=2314.424s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=2319.232s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Melanie, I think you said in your first sentence that a rubric will be created, but the rubric already exists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=2324.935s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's just to create a template for us, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j0VVw7Ha8DI&t=2689.357s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Notwithstanding all of that and the process, I think that it's only appropriate, though, and Kathy made some comments, and I know we don't want to go into large comments, so I'm just going to say this has been an extraordinarily challenging year, and I think that the superintendent has risen to the challenge in an extraordinary way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hAlwg1wwBNo&t=3306.896s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I just want to point out, Mr. Gertman had his hand raised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hAlwg1wwBNo&t=3310.738s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3295.373s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3296.814s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So Melanie, Medford was one of the key districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3301.736s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There were either six, there's been one that went in and out and whatever, but was one of the original districts that started Shore Collaborative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3310.519s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so we had a very special relationship with them for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3314.34s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We also had far more students than our present enrollment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3320.55s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so the number of students has fallen as we've brought more kids back into our own programs, for example, and either sought different alternatives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3332.895s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the things about SURE was that it started out because the costs for outplacements were so high and districts working together<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3342.995s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: determined that they could provide better quality programs for a lot less expense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3349.902s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: SURE was originally directed under Hank Owens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3352.665s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You may know the SURE Center is called the Hank Owens Report, who was a very dynamic leader for many, many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3362.134s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But that, you know, the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3366.288s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's really a terrific opportunity when you are the rep, because you get to meet monthly with a school committee member from each of the member districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3379.418s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I always know when I was the rep, as Paul is now, that that was a great thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3384.421s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But our membership has fallen a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3388.244s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So we still have that position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3390.026s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We're still one of the founding members and whatever, but we've never had that with any other out<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3396.67s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: out placement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3592.866s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I had put that on because, so over the years it's differed, but there were some years when we've had the student rep has asked to give a report, and it's maybe been a couple of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3605.489s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Every time they do, we've asked them, say, this is terrific, this is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3610.15s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: and we ask them to continue to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3612.512s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Because the students change, unless we're asking for it, I don't think that they'll, the students won't necessarily know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3619.697s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I put, I was one of the people who put it on saying that we've done it in the past and when we do, it's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3627.802s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So we should ask that it be done at least on an annual basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3632.505s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, the student reps obviously are always there to be able to contribute, but I think that sometimes<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3637.766s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: asking for them to give us a report has been very helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3660.526s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Again, Paul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3664.017s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: With food service, it was my understanding that we were supposed to have just the way we have a PAC.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3669.618s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think with food service, unless it's changed, we were also supposed to have a inclusive committee for food service that would also give feedback to the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3683.881s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't believe we met, obviously last year isn't a good comparison.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3691.173s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But certainly for many years, we would meet yearly for food service report, which was also inclusive of issues with food service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3701.5s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We might have asked for some feedback about the quality of the food, what we're seeing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3707.885s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Usually there were students included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3709.626s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think that's kind of dropped off recently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3712.328s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm sorry, my other phone is ringing, so I'll mute myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/149wJZ-aHMk&t=3715.07s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=153.943s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=155.704s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Kathy Kreatz?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=157.125s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=158.783s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Melanie McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=160.425s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=163.108s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Me and the stone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=167.232s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=167.693s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=168.393s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mia is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=169.975s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Paul Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=229.582s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=230.542s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=231.222s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You should first ask if there are any other nominations, and then the nomination has to be said by saying the name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=310.057s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=312.551s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I did speak to Member Ruseau earlier today, and we agreed that if any letters come in today, since I wasn't familiar yet with the process, that he would read them today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=322.899s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'll take over in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=327.002s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And you'll be the secretary one more night?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=610.752s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to – I was in signing the bills last Wednesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=615.917s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Finally, a lot of bills came through for food service, which I had been sort of on the lookout for, so I was glad to see them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=624.266s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Everything else seemed to be in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=626.188s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I want to thank all of the secretaries, particularly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=631.374s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Gina Citrano, who sort of helps organize the bills for me, but everybody who is involved in the process of getting the bills together and making sure that we are in order and our bills are being paid as they should be appropriately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=650.35s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There's a lot of paperwork involved and I just am very appreciative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=2626.478s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: How many people are in the pool or expected to be in the pool?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=5563.988s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, thank you, Mr. Downs and Dr. Burnham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=5567.07s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm very interested in hearing about the restorative justice piece that you mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=5571.773s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Downs, I did notice in your report you included some great comments, very positive comments, and showcasing real success, especially many comments around the just gratefulness for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=5586.963s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: expressed that the kids were able to be attending school in a hybrid way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=5592.307s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: However, I did notice that you didn't necessarily tell us what the negative comments were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=5598.672s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So if I were to just ask you about what one or two of the most insightful comments on how you could improve, what areas were most suggested?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=5615.431s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I am.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=5616.732s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm assuming that because you said, here are the positive comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=5711.913s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I really do applaud the book club.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=5714.379s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it's great when you've got your staff coming together to discuss, you know, some new ideas and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=5722.712s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: really reflect on thinking, so I think that's terrific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=5726.893s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to also ask you though, is there any, I was just kind of been kind of curious, we haven't heard much about transportation issues this year, and I've been wondering how the transportation and the bus, whether many students are using it, what you're seeing, and if you could just address that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=7197.788s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=7198.688s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=7199.509s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=7201.227s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I just wanted to ask, when I look at the schedule, that last piece, the spring sports going to July 3rd, that means that our seniors would have already graduated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=7215.054s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Will they continue to be eligible to play?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=7217.415s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And how's that going to work?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=7256.098s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you think that the fact that the season will go beyond the end of school, will our students still continue to participate and not be deterred by that late cutoff date?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=8691.284s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=8692.605s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: First, I want to thank Melanie for bringing it to our attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=8695.748s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Melanie, I know you sent out information to us today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=8698.771s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Did that have the webinar link in it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=8702.574s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=8703.715s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NISeEVILrmI&t=8707.779s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Paul has his hand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=1.558s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Jenny Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=2.539s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=3.399s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Kathy Kreatz?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=5.42s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Melanie McLaughlin?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=7.842s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Miama Stone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=8.783s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=9.623s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Paul Russo?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=11.244s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=12.045s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Paulette Van der Kloot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=12.865s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=13.666s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Lungo-Koehn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=542.123s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Brian.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=543.744s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Brianna, can I jump in for a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=545.045s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=545.346s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=545.666s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member van de Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=546.947s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So as you can see, we have some terrific leadership in Brian Buck, who's joined us as president this year, and David in his continuing role as the grants chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=558.956s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Diane Caldwell is going to join our little group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=563.02s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And what we are really in need of is we are in need of some fundraising people because that's a major piece of what we need to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=570.345s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But it's exciting, it's fun work, it's fun to be able to give out money, and we really appreciate the teachers who take the time to put in a grant because there's no guarantee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=581.608s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the things though that happened on this is that because of the number of, you know, we saw a good number of requests for Pear Deck,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=590.211s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I was able to go follow up and have a discussion about that and find out that, yes, the district is in fact going to supply that to our teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=599.221s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And when we saw such interest coming in from teachers, that was just a really great thing to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=604.686s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There's a couple of people I'd like to thank specifically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=607.63s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I had long talks with Molly Layden, our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=611.994s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Director of Technology, with Bernadette Riccadeli, with Chad Fallon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=619.719s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm afraid I'm going to leave some people out, but I was very, very appreciative to get their expertise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=625.442s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So when we were following up on these grant proposals, we were doing it wisely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=632.226s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So anyway, thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=634.467s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This is the good news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=647.784s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: A couple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=653.526s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, time flies when you're having fun, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=2748.246s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=2749.107s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm sorry I didn't realize it was muted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=2751.269s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I couldn't unmute myself but thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=2753.791s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to thank Miss Baptiste and the students for bringing us that lovely presentation tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=2759.117s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Earlier I was thinking about how much I missed all the holiday concerts that they, for I've gone<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=2766.083s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: for many years, and they've just always added that certain sense of time and celebration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=2772.128s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And it really felt funny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=2773.59s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I walked into the high school this morning for another reason and saw the empty auditorium and wished I was going there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=2781.017s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I really appreciate that this was brought to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=2784.239s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I was speaking to a friend who is a member of the Boston Gay Men's Choir.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=2788.363s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And they had done a piece, and he was explaining the process of how difficult it was to get everybody coordinated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=2797.19s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And hearing our teacher doing this work with our students is particularly heartwarming to know that they've gone through the same process and all the labor, a labor of love, and thank you for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=2810.099s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=2812.721s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Kreatz?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=4580.602s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Kh7pOoZw_4E&t=4581.403s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=130.428s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=132.169s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Paul Rousseau?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=134.77s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Paulette Vanderkloot, present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=136.091s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Lungo-Koehn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2551.429s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2553.225s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So we had the building the future committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2555.526s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I would say that it came somewhat similar in that there was a great deal of discussion amongst in the community about the shape.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2567.894s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And then several school committee members, including myself spearheaded, bringing it to the floor for discussion and, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2577.28s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: moving it forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2579.361s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the things which helped us was we had dynamic leadership of the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2584.223s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Rick Orlando and Tricia McDonough really did such an incredibly fabulous job outlining the path.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2592.867s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The first discussions were, there was a series of events around the community, listening events, getting people's input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2602.791s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: What were they thinking?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2603.651s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: What were they seeing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2604.551s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: What were their reactions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2607.012s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: and their concerns as we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2610.055s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And remember, at that point, there was no, you know, in a similar way, we had not preconceived that we were going to build four new schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2619.262s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We didn't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2620.503s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: All of that came into being over the course of the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2626.387s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: of the committee looking at the various different resources, concerns, land parcels availability, but even would they be K to H, would they be, none of that was preconceived.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2641.359s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That was all part of the work of the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2645.122s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And that was then defined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2648.064s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the things that was extremely important was there were different phases of the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2653.008s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So the first was kind of the outreach<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2656.271s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Then the second was taking the information and coming up with some decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2661.215s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And those ones then were brought to the school committee for our input, because if we weren't buying it, there was no way we were going to be able to sell it to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2673.908s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And then a variety of different meetings happened around<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2678.812s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: uh Medford uh you know outreaching to different groups and whatnot explaining what was um uh<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2686.599s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: what project proposals there were, what ideas there were, and narrowing it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2691.683s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So it's really quite a process in the same way that I think that we're thinking here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2697.568s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Were there discussions about educational?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2701.511s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, absolutely, and they need to be included as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2705.435s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the things though that is very interesting sort of looking back is that there will be people who say, I just don't understand why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2716.493s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And they really have no understanding today why certain decisions were made back then about either the placement of the schools or why there's a K to eight and a middle school on one piece of property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2732.383s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's one of the interesting things as time goes on, those pieces are lost to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2737.787s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And then we have people saying, I don't understand this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2741.069s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I can tell you that all of those decisions were thoroughly vetted<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2746.605s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: and that there was a basis for each one of those decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2750.566s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But over time, it does get lost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2752.806s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's a valuable thing for me to realize as we go forward with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2758.567s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I do wanna mention, by the way, that there was at the time, the third stage of building the future committee, which is what we called it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2770.369s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The third stage was the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2773.77s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And there was some work<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2775.49s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, things done over time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2777.571s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And then at some point, Dr. Perrella, you may recall, the former headmaster of the high school, he put together a, he wanted to put together a grant and he looked very much at the library area and discussed a lot about what should be happening educationally in that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2799.897s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I thought it was a very thorough vetting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2801.897s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There was a, at the time,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2804.385s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There was a, they put together a presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2807.969s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's something that you know as we're talking about the things we're talking about not just the physical structure but how is the building going to be used educationally, we should, even though of course I'm sure it needs to be updated but we should look back to that, what happened at that point to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2824.638s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The, it was a very dedicated group of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2831.043s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: They had to be able to meet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2833.806s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think at first we were meeting weekly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2837.869s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We could check with Rick Orlando and Tricia about exactly that, but it was a long process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2844.454s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I would say that it was probably about a year before we came<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2849.338s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: was the first presentation and the first narrowing down steps was, you know, it was a significant process of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2860.487s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know if that answers the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2894.889s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2895.369s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We certainly had a few staff, but there were also people who acted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2899.891s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: They might have attended the meetings because they were giving information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2903.432s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2905.312s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, so it depended, but I think we were we really started at ground zero without great<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=2914.69s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, with no preconceptions about what was going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3456.258s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the things I just wanted to mention was the importance of also having<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3464.44s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: members go out and even if just in the initial process we did visitations to other school districts and that was so important and that's really harder to do right now because of COVID but you know most of us are framed you know we know our high school maybe we've been in another one but we certainly you know haven't been in a lot and we we went to quite a few other districts and that was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3491.793s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: very instrumental and that required that people were also available to take some time during the day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3501.704s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And that was important because it excited us incredibly to see, to come out of our world and also to see what was being offered<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3513.125s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: in other districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3514.025s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I just want to mention that, that maybe it can be conveyed somewhat by people visiting and then doing presentations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3523.009s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: They can be, you know, that might be a job, if you would, that some people go, a smaller amount go and then make a presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=3531.271s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But that's just another aspect we want to make sure we're doing is visitations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4415.904s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I want to ask member Rousseau to read what he had read at the beginning, his charge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4422.649s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Paul, can you just repeat it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4597.186s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Paul, you know personally I think that's a fine starting point to be able to I mean, to take what Paul has has written and for us that to deliberate on it to give feedback to the superintendent and, and, you know, for us to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4617.05s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, then if she could develop some way to share that with us, and then I think that would make sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4625.134s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And while I can understand Jenny's concern about not Maurice having too much, I think it's absolutely critical that Maurice does play a strong role in this development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4637.12s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think that works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4640.401s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, I like Paul's starting point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4642.662s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: personally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEO0m0tZkkY&t=4643.202s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it's a good place to begin with, it's solid, but yet there's also a lot of potentials for discussion as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=61.617s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, thanks everybody for joining us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=64.338s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm on my cell phone right now having a little bit of a problem, but we'll start off here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=193.73s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Sorry, I'm just a little confused because I had some problems, so excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=199.572s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Can we start off?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=201.973s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And superintendent, if you could take it away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2326.637s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Pfizer, thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2328.659s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That was a very comprehensive report with so much information built in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2337.648s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: you ended up really on the key point that I think we're all concerned about is what will be the impact of this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2346.095s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And especially, like I can, if I think about eighth grade, the eighth grade course, we've talked about many, many times how intense that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2356.302s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so now those kids have gone on into ninth grade, and I'm wondering what the teachers are telling you and what you're seeing so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2438.521s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm curious whether you're seeing a difference in the students who are fully remote versus the students who are hybrid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2538.24s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I'm having some issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2539.601s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I can't unmute myself except by the space bar, and I can't go into a gallery view, so I can't see other people's questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2548.887s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So, Jenny, I'm gonna ask you if you can, can you see, if you can see everybody, could you call on people for questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=2792.189s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=3711.607s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I see that the superintendent had her hand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4091.18s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Jenny, do you see other hands up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4092.981s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Or if not, I've got some more questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4782.166s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4782.626s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think you're just making me feel better today, Faiza.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4788.151s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's okay for me to forget something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4800.4s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Certainly in the middle of the night, you will pop up and say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4828.139s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4829.62s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I had a couple of questions, but except is Ingrid, did Ingrid have a follow-up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4840.147s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Ingrid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4841.608s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The question I had was for, I was curious whether we had had any parent feedback on illustrative math so far, and also we had<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4855.038s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You talked about the professional development that was done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4857.72s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Did we have or how many new math teachers did we have into the system at the beginning of this year that needed to have professional development and was that completed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4927.602s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I wanted to, yesterday by chance I had a discussion with Molly Layden about the document cameras.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4934.188s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And it seems like they're such a popular item right now, they're delayed for another month or two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4942.776s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Right now, do some of the teachers have them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4983.937s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And now I wanted to circle back to my colleague's discussion about creating a catalog.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4991.965s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Faiza, you seem like you're well on your way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=4995.965s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, with the information you've presented us tonight, would it be appropriate, Superintendent, to ask Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5002.247s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Kahn to begin that piece of documenting for the mathematics curriculum, what we are calling a catalog?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5012.49s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But Faiza, I think you heard some of the information that we want, and Jenny, if you could weigh in about other things that you had in mind, particularly for the creation of this document,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5269.396s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to be careful, though, because it's not the it's not the school committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5272.837s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We don't want to give you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5275.498s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: direction in whatever I so I had referred through the superintendent whether it would be possible given Wisconsin excellent report tonight if we went on and you know if you might have the discussion with her about taking this to the next step and beginning this process of creating the catalog and you know would seem like as we have these meetings that that's exactly what we should do as sort of after after each meeting is asking the department head<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5305.497s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: to in fact create that kind of information that it would be a logical next step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5309.622s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So Superintendent if you'd address that please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5558.735s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5559.976s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And Jenny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5777.054s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so speaking of squeezing it all in, our next meeting is going to concentrate in January on foreign languages and technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5786.995s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We wanted to get to foreign language because we had raised some questions about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5791.819s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And technology was also in, it's gonna be a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5796.283s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So we might certainly schedule it for a two hour block.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5801.847s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So we have time to devote to each area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5806.191s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: February was supposed to be science.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5809.113s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And then March was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5811.645s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: English language arts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5813.867s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I know, Jenny, you had asked whether ELA could come sooner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5818.552s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The superintendent, I'm not sure if you had the chance to have that discussion with Dr. Chiesa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5915.438s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just want to say at the beginning of the meeting, I was flustered enough with my technology snafus that I didn't announce that the members of the subcommittee are myself and Jenny Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5928.661s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mia couldn't make it, but Paul Rousseau was in attendance tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5933.141s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So we appreciate that he was here as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5937.682s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Jenny, do you have any further thoughts before we wrap this meeting up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5967.66s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5968.321s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Kahn, I would particularly like to thank you for your presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5971.922s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I've always enjoyed when you're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5973.502s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5974.603s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Paulette?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=5976.643s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, Paul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=6083.219s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: On that motion, Jenny?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=6085.862s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=6087.184s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Paulette, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=6089.487s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And for the sake of it, Paul, you want to vote?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P1mOngMoa2g&t=6094.234s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=99.754s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Certainly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1369.947s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, so we met on November 18.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1371.827s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Present was myself, Jenny Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1374.448s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mia could not make it, so Paul Rousseau attended in her place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1379.51s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We began with a presentation from Tanya Sullivan and Alex Lark, co-chairs of the Medford CPAC, and they made a presentation reminding us that they speak for 20% of Medford Public Schools students and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1394.998s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: that they've been advocating for a disability awareness program for many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1405.048s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Also, Melanie McLaughlin also attended, and she was the previous head of the CPAC, and also was very active in this program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1416.258s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: advocating for this program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1418.899s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Joan Bowen and Susanna Campbell presented the disability awareness in the classroom presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1425.842s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Susanna Campbell is presented an overview of the course that she ran last year and is going to now run again this January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1436.265s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The professional development is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1438.446s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: available on the Professional Development website and is now open for registration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1444.588s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's open to all staff, not just teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1448.109s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The program is going to run Thursday afternoons from 3.15 to 5.15 in January and February via Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1454.871s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The course includes the history of disabilities in the U.S.,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1460.973s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: and U.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1461.433s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: legislation, ableism, belief in our society that not being disabled is the norm, disability etiquette, so teachers can model disability etiquette, and asking a person what they want, if they want assistance rather than stepping in, and the unique needs of students with various disabilities, and also tools to break down stereotypes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1490.64s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Key curricular concepts are positive representation of people with disabilities in content area lessons, universal design for learning helps all have better access, anti-ableism language practice into content area lessons, reframe misconceptions, building a more inclusive environment and creating a better community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1517.812s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The next steps,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1520.517s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: is to recruit is to have the PD course January and February of 2021 then recruit volunteers to pilot a disability awareness curriculum in February 2021 and then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1533.541s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: a pilot in classrooms, March to May 2021.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1538.222s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This is not a one and done, and this is one of the most important things that really was stressed in the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1545.504s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This disability awareness, we want it to be embedded into everyday instruction, so that it's not something that which simply just happens once, it's a, you know, get some fanfare, and then it's left behind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1557.268s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Rather, the concept<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1558.848s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: and the awareness needs to be embedded into the curriculum so it is ongoing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1562.371s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That was a very important point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1565.493s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We talked about a book that one fifth grade teacher was using and the lesson plans that had come out of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1575.52s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Last time, 48 teachers took the course and it's hoping that there will be as many this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1584.761s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's done on a volunteer basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1588.762s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And the end result is creating curriculum units that can be shared amongst our staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1601.585s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Again, we talked a little bit about why we weren't doing a specialized curriculum, but rather embedding it in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1610.046s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: CPAC had done research on this in past years and there had been an attempt at the one school, but it ended up being a special event rather than having the long-term impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1625.659s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Let's see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1629.742s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We're starting from the pilot and we're growing from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1632.084s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1638.047s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Susanna Campbell mentioned that we're taking a two-pronged course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1641.711s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: One is about teaching students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1643.413s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The other part is teaching teachers to use universal design to help them become more knowledgeable about disabilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1655.033s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We've asked that there would be a report and update at the end of the year, and that's been scheduled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1661.957s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so we'll be reporting back to the committee about how many teachers signed up and took the course and how many volunteers we had and how we were able to implement this this year, this year being 2021 in the spring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1679.568s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Lastly, I just want to mention to you that the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1684.986s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The next meeting is on December 10th, but that is this Thursday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1689.689s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And we're going to be looking at the math curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1692.091s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We also wanted to convey our thanks both to the, particularly to Tanya Sullivan and Alex Lorick of the CPAC and to Susanna Campbell and Joan Bowen for all the work they did in giving the information for us for this subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1712.625s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=1816.244s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=2284.807s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Always trying to shut me up some way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=2286.048s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: All right, so I just, just for the public, we're not, I'm not going to address this right now only because I think we have some reports coming and we certainly will have some questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=2321.62s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Melanie has her hand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=2340.191s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4670.447s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4671.648s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to be clear on making sure that I understand the teacher's statement and the information that, Tony, you're supplying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4683.059s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Up to this point, my understanding was that there was only one in-school transmission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4691.627s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Do we have any more than that at this point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4705.734s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But we've heard that there's a large number of teachers out at the Roberts in particular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4714.779s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That's because they are quarantining?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4741.753s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So a positive case that was in school, is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4767.565s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: we are not seeing in-school transmission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4770.927s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If I understand it correctly, what you're saying is that because of the testing and our ability to pick up cases, we are getting to those students and faculty members before they've actually become positive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4789.1s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4806.367s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4806.968s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, I certainly understand the, you know, when all of a sudden we hear that there's a greater number of teachers who are on quarantine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4817.015s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I certainly understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4818.256s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think all of us feel this right now, this anxiety as we see the case number get higher and higher throughout not only Massachusetts, but the country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4830.746s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And, you know, sort of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4833.268s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: it's very unsettling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4835.149s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But what you're saying is so far the data says that we're doing okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4866.136s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, by no means am I dismissing the anxiety attached to being told you should quarantine or whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4874.945s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, I certainly understand that that is an important piece of what our staff and teachers are conveying to us is that they're nervous about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4888.306s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But what you're saying right now is there's really been no change in the data, which would suggest that we need to do something different in terms of having students come to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4899.696s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4959.027s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess then the next question really goes to the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4963.931s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: When we see the number of staff getting higher because they're on quarantine, do we have enough?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4972.118s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I know that there's been an incredible effort<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4976.135s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: to cover classes and that the administrative people and others have just really stepped up and covered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4984.402s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But when we see what's going on at the Roberts right now with a certain level of teachers being out, are we able to cover the classrooms?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=4992.93s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is it still working?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=8205.349s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=8205.649s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=8206.45s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Madam Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=8208.431s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Adam is seeking to, has his hand up for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=8211.837s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I was going to that next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=8214.459s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Adam.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=9816.645s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I just wanted to thank you for the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=9819.546s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think this is a very positive thing for our students, and I particularly like to see the teachers who responded about how this, even though students may not be in school, it's still pulling them together and creating a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=9833.392s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=9834.432s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=9834.812s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11582.027s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11584.792s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11588.495s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: A couple of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11589.836s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: First of all, I want to express my gratitude for the extensive amount of work in putting this together and updating it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11598.223s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11599.264s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: They're very comprehensive report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11603.328s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Specifically, on page 28 on the form itself, bullying incident reporting form, I see that it says date of report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11613.628s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: but I don't see a line that says date of incident or even date of alleged incident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11620.113s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so a report could be made six days afterwards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11626.337s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we should clarify what the date is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11631.12s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, perhaps it does exist someplace, or maybe you just assume that somebody would write it in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11636.564s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But just in case, to me, that just stood out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11641.714s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Peter, do you want to talk to that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11653.223s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11655.485s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The next thing I want to speak to is that when I see the page and I'm flipping back about notifications, there's not a timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11663.091s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm concerned that there aren't timelines put into this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11666.814s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Notify parents, caregiver of the target.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11671.033s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: When does that happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11672.734s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, you know, all of a sudden, you know, when the investigative report, I sort of, I think that we, that we need to be clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11683.039s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I understand timelines are tricky because there's holidays, there's weekends, there's whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11688.142s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But yet without any timeline, you kind of take away some level of teeth to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11695.343s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, my colleague Melanie brought up many good reports and I really do like the idea of a simple one page thing, a summary, in some ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11706.602s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But the other thing which makes me a little bit nervous is that because this is so comprehensive, I'm not really comfortable just approving it tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11714.826s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And normally I would expect that this would go, and I know nobody wants to have another meeting, but normally I would expect it to go to rules and regulations or whatever policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11727.892s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So rather than just approving it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11730.207s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If we're not gonna send it there, and I don't know the will of the committee, I would suggest we lay it on the table and we have updates, the one page update added to it before our approval at the next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11744.355s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But I would like to, I'm not gonna make the motion, I'd like my colleagues to weigh in and let me know what their comfort level is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11796.51s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, that's kind of an unusual way for a school committee to do business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11802.051s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, because part of me would say that you'd certainly be following this better policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11812.333s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But I guess I'm comfortable with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11817.224s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: What about the timelines issue?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11851.226s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11851.646s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And to add the date of the incident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11854.467s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11869.946s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I would like to see it where it says date of report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11875.27s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Let's see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11875.63s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I have to find the page again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11878.212s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It might be 28.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11880.634s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm looking for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11883.356s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Here we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11885.777s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Where it says date of report, right underneath that, if you move that up rather than making it, it should say date of incident or date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11896.365s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It could be dates, actually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=11899.703s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Anyway, I see some of my colleagues have their hands up, so I'd like them to weigh in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12311.141s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Jenny Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12312.121s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12312.862s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Kathy Kreatz?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12314.003s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12314.683s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Melanie McLaughlin?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12316.391s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12317.091s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mia Mastone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12318.052s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12318.812s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Paul Rousseau?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12320.633s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Paulette Vanderkloot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12321.454s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12321.914s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Lungo-Koehn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12971.69s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I believe that the first piece of that is that the superintendent would supply the school committee with a self evaluation and I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=12983.54s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: certainly support that it's important for us to do the superintendent's evaluation, but I think that it's a little bit unfair to ask her to have that ready by December 21st in just two weeks, given all that she's handling right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13001.592s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I would respectfully ask that we put it to the first meeting that she would supply us that documentation at the first meeting of January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13166.533s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13167.593s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it certainly, Kathy, since you had that review, if you could just send it to the rest of us so we could see the other steps involved, I think that would be important for us to review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13395.845s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, but keep in mind that we have, in fact, been setting goals for the superintendent throughout this period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13402.549s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We've talked about goals of inclusivity, of involving, if you think about all the meetings that we had during the summer, we've set a goal about getting kids back to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13412.956s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's not like, I realize it hasn't been in the formal<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13418.659s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: way that you're suggesting, but it would be erroneous to think that we haven't been giving direction to our superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13429.724s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And we certainly have plenty to be able to reflect upon on how she has been handling this process, which is, in my opinion, been extremely strong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13443.35s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: My recollection from all other times is what we do is that each of us individually will fill out an evaluation once the superintendent gives us her self evaluation and then we'll gather as a committee and discuss it and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13461.784s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: decide how we're gonna come up with either a collaborative document to then share with the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13470.066s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think in the past, the superintendent has been part of those discussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13474.427s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But again, I think that the next step is to review what we're supposed to do technically, just to, so we all are on the same page, and that we ask the superintendent to provide us with her self-evaluation<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13489.42s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: by mid-January at the latest, so that we can go ahead with the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13494.423s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think we're all in agreement, really.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13524.924s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I think we've already articulated many goals which we could write down and then we could take a look at and articulate goals for the rest of the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13562.148s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, and the superintendent also has a major piece in setting out goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13568.652s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So it's a joint conversation because she's very much will be a piece of articulating those goals and quantifying them as you suggest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13837.021s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Let's set it for February 8th, that it will be done by February 8th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13867.758s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: By the 8th, the process should be complete.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13870.34s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So that means that if the superintendent gives us her self-evaluation at the first<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13876.108s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: or even the second meeting in January, and the first might be preferable, or mid-Feb, whatever, that we will have set up a committee of the whole meeting, and we will commit to having done the self-evaluations and the other steps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13924.396s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm saying that because I think Jenny does have a point that we want to get it done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13928.079s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's why I'm putting an end date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13930.501s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If we get it done before that, that's even better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=13933.183s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But this way, we've given the superintendent enough time, but we've committed ourselves to making sure it gets done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14078.49s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14079.39s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Lungo-Koehn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14104.191s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor, I would ask that we allow the superintendent a little bit more time than the first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14109.154s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And to Member Graham, this is part of the superintendent's job to set up these meetings and do it in a timely fashion and whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14120.76s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I sometimes feel like it's important to let her have the latitude.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14126.503s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I understand your<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14127.74s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: your need to make sure that it's started early and that process is started early.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14132.722s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But again, I just personally, I think that we need to trust the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14142.507s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And if she's not setting up the budget in a timely fashion or whatever, and I just don't think we have to legislate it as my own personal opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14153.151s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that if you're,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14154.905s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Concerned about it or any member is concerned about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14158.647s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that for me that the best way about it is having conversation with the superintendent and only if she's not then being responsive would you then go about and put it in a resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14169.593s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So my personal opinion is that this falls under the superintendent's purview and you're suggesting I think that you would like to have it sooner rather than later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14182.194s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If you want to go forward with your resolution, which I'm sure you do, I would just suggest that we say that by the end of January, just to give her a little more latitude.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14191.726s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I would amend it to be the end of January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14256.296s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Will you accept the amendment to the end of January, Jenny?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14384.493s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think I've offered an amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14386.875s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think Kathy has seconded it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14388.677s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So should we vote on the amendment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14403.391s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14404.112s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: On that motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14409.788s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14655.781s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14658.803s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Just a follow up on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14660.063s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So that means, will the superintendent then report back to us at our next school committee meeting about when that report can be done?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14932.201s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Should we vote on it as a motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vMv1Z56Vk1s&t=14949.701s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=37.733s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Paul at Vanderkloot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=38.953s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=39.554s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Lungo-Koehn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2325.132s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, so I just wanted to go back to Mary Ann if I could, or Tony, I don't know who better to ask this question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2332.22s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So all together there we have 27 students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2335.523s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: When the contact tracers call their home,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2338.967s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is it generally, like of the 27, do they know where they were in contact with someone with COVID?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2348.65s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Do they have certainty of the, like you mentioned, well, the father had it or the mother, or do you have people saying, I have no idea?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2395.52s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you follow up and ask them if they've been going to the grocery store and other specifics?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2411.164s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So of the students, of the 27 students, if we could talk about in-school transmission, how many of those are suspected to be in-school transmission?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2439.338s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So in the in-school transmission case, and I realize we don't obviously wanna identify anybody, but how was it determined that that student, did they come to school sick?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2456.088s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Could you just give us a better understanding?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=2482.005s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, thank you, Maria.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=3082.227s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4982.175s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I know they've been waiting an awful long time, but what I would do is I could just ask Member Graham one question for clarification, and then if you would call upon me after we let the residents speak, I don't want them to have to wait any longer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=4995.72s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But the clarification is, Jenny, you mentioned maybe I should make an amendment, maybe it should be a new resolution, but I wasn't sure what,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5005.104s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: precisely you are either amending or what your resolution would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5009.525s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So could you give us the wording so we understand?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5123.327s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So to clarify, if there was the Brooks School classroom, second grade was sent home, it would say, you know, so sort of a red flag, current closures, Brooks School, grade two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5139.989s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So if we- Select grade two or something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5142.71s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Right, so that's just a total hypothetical to be clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5146.152s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But then the question is when we do that, and this goes back to Marianne, is the whole confidentiality issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5157.157s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And are we really giving people more, I mean, if grade two is closed at whatever school, okay, wouldn't automatically, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5170.197s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: parents would be notified, let's face it, the school would soon know, what are you really accomplishing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5176.618s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, yes, it is a way of, it would be one way of seeing it across the district, and from that, I like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5183.02s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, Brooks grade two, Roberts grade four, you know, Cohart C, you know, that would work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5241.391s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So if the box said, or if the next current closures, okay, so the box said current closures, and right now, do we have any closures, superintendent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5258.038s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Let me ask the confidentiality question first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5526.101s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So, Mayor, I actually had the floor, but I wanna get to, I know Mr. Began has had his hand up for a long time and there are others, but, and then I'd like to make a statement afterwards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5548.587s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't think he heard you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=5550.95s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6125.909s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6126.989s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So, some of the speakers made points that I wanted to make and first I will start out with Mr. begins point that the really great news is just the one in school transmission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6139.195s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's, that's just fantastic news and.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6143.517s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: we can certainly hope that we can continue that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6149.903s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: To the speaker who talked about the role of the school committee and us representing, well, we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6157.049s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And when I was elected, I always take that a certain amount of people at least have enough faith in my judgment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6166.497s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Sometimes we will disagree, but overall, you have listened to me enough and you have some level of faith in my thinking and in my judgment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6177.2s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: As a school committee member, I have watched our superintendent and her team very carefully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6185.662s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We looked at the policies that we've outlined and I see them following them and working very meticulously as many of the speakers made reference to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6197.169s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I have personally no reason to question her judgment on making a call if we were<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6207.568s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: facing a situation, I believe that she would evaluate with her team and with the city people, and also maybe a call to the school committee members, because we certainly would want to be kept in the loop, but I've never felt that I've not been kept in the loop by the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6225.252s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But I wouldn't need to be called into a special meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6228.073s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I wouldn't want to put that as this body, the school committee, now would be the ones who make that decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6237.815s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I have trust that the school committee has selected our superintendent to carry out our policies and I have every reason to believe that that's what she would be doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6251.199s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I would support the motion by my colleague and also like to thank everybody for all their<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6260.021s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: work on these issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6262.302s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I would support the clarification that member Graham spoke to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6270.926s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: In the general sense, not specific, because I think we went through the discussion about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6275.929s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I think that's good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6278.75s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If you wanted to do an analogy, we could talk about snow days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6283.915s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And some might say, well, Paulette, you're making it so simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6287.539s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But frankly, when there's a snow day, a superintendent makes a call with a lot of different inputs about the safety<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6298.825s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: of the travel for our students, travel for our teachers, the conditions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6306.388s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She confers with other experts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6308.889s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She might confer with other superintendents as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6311.891s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And there's always going to be people who are going to disagree with the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6316.072s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And there's always going to be people, and luckily we've heard from some of them tonight, which is nice that you've taken the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6323.195s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: who's going to support the decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6325.116s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, it's a simplification, obviously this is far more difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6329.137s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: To the speaker who said you're not giving parents enough, well the problem is that this is a pandemic and all I can say to parents is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6338.4s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: At any point, we need you to think about your backup plans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6342.443s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I am sure many of you, all of you, are thinking about that on a day-to-day basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6347.846s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We are in a circumstance that calls upon families to be flexible and nimble in the most difficult ways, which obviously none of us would possibly choose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6362.595s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So on saying all of that, I would support leaving the decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6367.076s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I always feel that as a school committee member, ultimately, as I vote on the superintendent's contract, that is my probably most important role in so many ways besides making policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6380.659s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And this superintendent, Dr. Marisa Edward-Vincent and her team have showed extraordinarily dedication and also have worked<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6391.582s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: very closely with the school committee to make sure that they are doing what we are asking of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=6890.314s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd like to move the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7926.064s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you want to do the amendment first?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7938.114s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7940.255s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: On the amendment, can we just lump them together?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7943.677s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7944.377s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7946.038s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: On the amendments, member Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7949.559s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7950.22s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Kreatz?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7951.52s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7952.321s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: McLaughlin?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7953.441s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7954.502s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7954.642s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Stone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7955.362s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7956.303s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Rousseau?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7960.545s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Hall?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7964.197s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Vanderclute, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7965.758s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Lungo-Koehn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=7988.725s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, Kathy, what was the original motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8080.314s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Continued authority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8081.615s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8190.462s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's still giving authority to the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8198.829s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But authority for what I think is what I'm trying to be clear about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8202.57s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: to determine whether the schools need to close or should remain open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8221.183s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Jenny Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8262.741s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We're affirming the superintendent's authority too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8313.501s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't think that separating section two with section three makes any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8319.045s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that it's the whole thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8325.411s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I don't understand my colleagues'<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8330.463s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, lack of clarity on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8331.884s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, to me, um, we're saying, yes, the superintendent is the one who's going to make the final call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8338.269s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We're, we're saying the superintendent, the school committee is not going to be called into session to make, to make, to take the vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8410.965s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That's just an unreal place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8412.666s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, we have meetings every two weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8417.047s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's not like this committee is just going to abdicate and walk off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8420.888s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We have continued meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8423.829s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We're talking about this at every meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8429.43s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that you're trying to define something so specifically is kind of losing the forest for the trees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8437.092s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, that's your opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8437.932s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/akf9szSeoOw&t=8515.952s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2.731s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, that's wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=7.272s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, so that's why we have to make sure we're ending in the appropriate time because the necessity for me, she lives in Maryland and I have to call while the little boys are awake and singing happy birthday and all the rest, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=44.301s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=44.701s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm just taking a look whether Tanya is here yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=49.144s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=50.445s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You're so good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=52.906s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=53.126s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And Alex?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=62.149s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: OK, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=63.03s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: All right, terrific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=65.672s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And Jenny is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=68.255s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And Mia Mustone, who's the other member, said she could not come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=74.46s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is Paul here yet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=76.722s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Not yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=77.123s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: He's going to be joining us just as someone else, another committee member, today since Mia couldn't make it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=84.641s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=85.601s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I have to read this long thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=88.043s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So let me find out where it went.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=91.304s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Hold on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=92.725s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so if you would, today is November 18th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=203.923s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll repeat that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=204.704s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Since the meeting will be held remotely, participants can log in or call by using the following link or a call-in number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=212.128s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So the call-in number is meeting ID 950-2877-9285.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=215.67s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Or if you want to call in, you could call in to 1-312-626-6799, US.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=251.855s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The agenda today is going to be to identify the plan to incorporate disability awareness into daily instruction as a pilot program in the Medford public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=261.703s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And we're going to have Joan Bowen and Susanna Campbell present, but we're going to start off with a different presentation first by our SPEDPAC.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=271.83s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: By the way, today,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=274.705s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The meeting can be viewed on Comcast 15 and Verizon Channel 45.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=280.728s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Apparently, we've been booted because there's another meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=285.43s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you very much for all of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=289.212s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If I could ask, as is our custom, if everybody could rise so we could say the Pledge of Allegiance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=296.841s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with justice and liberty for all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=307.767s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=309.548s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Jenny, could I ask you to take the roll?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=329.093s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Great, hello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=330.294s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=332.075s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So today we're gonna start off with a presentation that I don't know who's the lead person, but Tanya and Alex are going to start off with a presentation at the beginning of our meeting here so we can review the work that they've been doing over the years as part of the PAC.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=362.968s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Sorry, I didn't hear that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=364.068s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=413.641s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mine is cut off as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=415.921s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Maybe I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=762.902s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=763.222s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=764.583s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much, Alex.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=765.885s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And thank you for all your work with the special education pack.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=770.609s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: As you know, this is something that I've believed in very firmly and have been part of the discussions in the previous years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=778.775s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So this is the year, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=781.298s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=782.018s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=782.419s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Having said that now, I think I'm going to turn it over to Joan and or Susanna.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=787.363s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know who's going to take the lead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=1342.43s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=1549.245s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So, Suzanne, can you tell me how many teachers took the course the first time and what your hope is for enrollment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=1608.762s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=1611.064s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think that this work that you've been doing is really excellent, you know, and I've loved seeing the lesson plans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=1620.79s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: My only concern is it's possible that a student would go through eight grades and not happen to get any consistent<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=1634.687s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: discussion from year to year, depending on who this child's teachers are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=1877.757s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I might, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=1881.282s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Susan, do you want to answer and then go to Alex?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2151.015s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I had a question, um, the book that you cited, uh, from the teacher's lesson plan, out of my mind, is that a book that fifth graders, um, in most classes are reading?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2240.551s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Right, what I'm thinking is that, you know, again, it's wonderful the work you're doing today and the work you'll do in the next go round, but is there a way to, you know, suggest to other teachers who aren't participating at least to be looking at that lesson plan, which seems to be very comprehensive, so that maybe they'll be choosing that book too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2267.943s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: to read in their classrooms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2269.384s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Again, my concern is what you're doing is fantastic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2274.768s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It just is for those who either aren't participating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2277.99s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I totally understand that this year is so, again, how do we get all the curriculum pieces in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2284.235s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's why it's so fantastic to be able to infuse it into the curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2289.118s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But I'm wondering how we can encourage all teachers<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2294.325s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: to be looking at those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2296.787s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm wondering if we can identify a couple of lesson plans for each grade and send them out and just say, hey, FYI, this is one of the things that the district is really looking at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2307.874s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Here's some great lesson plans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2310.195s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I would think that for some of our teachers, they might be vastly relieved to have it laid out so clearly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2317.72s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I guess I'm trying to say, how do we ramp it up a little bit more?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2325.136s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, and I'm looking into next year too, how are we making sure that we are hitting, that there's, I mean, there's multiple topics, not just one topic, but so many different topics effectively for our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2340.469s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And, you know, I bet there will be some teachers who would just absolutely shine at doing this, but if your kid is not in that class, that's what the problem is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2387.485s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Jenny?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2703.061s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And remember, we also just last month talked about the racial equity piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2710.007s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So it's not just this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2712.71s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So there's multiple things that we're trying to provide comprehensive education for our kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2723.499s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So we have to talk a little bit more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2726.301s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Maurice, I see superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2901.923s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I was wondering whether any of the teachers who've participated before have been from the vocational school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2938.874s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, where I'm what I'm thinking is that, you know, as teachers are attending this they're also learning more about the disabilities that they students might have, particularly say, you know, a student on the spectrum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2958.308s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: that that goes across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2960.19s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So it may not be that the carpentry teacher in essence is really teaching or developing a unit, but also I guess there's another piece of saying, how do we make sure that our staff is knowledgeable about different disabilities that their students have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2982.563s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I don't know how we do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=2984.164s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Does anybody wanna address that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3069.064s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3071.459s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3072.42s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Anybody else like to have a question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3075.483s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Comment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3077.125s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Joan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3078.206s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: No?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3125.575s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3127.737s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Does anybody else have any questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3130.439s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, Alex?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3169.702s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, Alexia, that was exactly my question, is saying how will we follow up on this and then make sure that we're expanding on it in successive years and being able to also evaluate our success of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3189.233s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: implementing this curriculum or in our larger school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3196.216s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Any thoughts on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3274.788s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: How many teachers are you thinking in terms of the pilot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3302.937s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, I would think that it makes sense for this topic, again, that we touch back on it, either at the end of the year or definitely at the very beginning of next year, so we can see what happened and where we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3320.0s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Does that seem, the pilot program was listed in the original presentation, was that from March to May?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3331.506s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, that would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3333.126s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So we can either add it on, perhaps, to our topics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3336.247s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We do know how crazy June gets, but I think that we need to circle back to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3342.009s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Alex?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3425.119s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: As you say that, it also jogs me to be thinking that there are budget implications because we want to make sure that if there are particular books or units that people are excited about presenting, that they have the books or materials that they need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3445.395s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So doing this prior to budget so that we were knowledgeable about what we would need would be particularly good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3455.785s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, Paul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3508.574s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, Melanie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3591.777s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so Jenny, would you like to make a motion that the school committee curriculum subcommittee receive a reconvene in June or prior to budget so that we can get an update and we can see what funding might be necessary to continue this work?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3616.995s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3620.583s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3620.983s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'll second it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3660.87s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3662.091s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Jenny, will you call the roll?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3666.233s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3670.376s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3674.626s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3675.607s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, I think that we've really covered it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3678.31s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: First, thank you, Alex and Tanya.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3680.353s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is there anything else that either of you would like to add?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3704.133s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3705.975s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3706.515s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3707.415s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you to both of you and to the work of the PAC over not just this year, but for many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3713.62s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And that includes Melanie, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3716.182s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3717.972s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm just want to remind her we have a meeting in December off the top of my head.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3723.179s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm going to say it's December 11 December 10, I believe, 10, so it's a 10 so close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3729.568s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3729.848s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think we were going to look at addicts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3733.978s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3737.319s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3737.879s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So we're looking at mathematics in December.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3739.98s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We will again continue to let everybody here know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3743.201s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So now this may be unprecedented, but, and Melanie, I know that you've had maybe a slightly shorter meeting, but I am going to ask whether we have a motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3761.691s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That means that we have actually accomplished something we have yet to accomplish.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3766.146s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We are having a shorter meeting than called for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3768.874s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's because everybody was so well prepared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vuekGeCcKsE&t=3772.104s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=104.078s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Certainly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=105.039s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Jenny Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=118.208s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I see you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=711.745s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1411.531s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, so the ramp, as I understand it, was put in to assist loading and unloading, particularly of the musical instruments and whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1421.996s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And it was never meant to be ADA accessible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1425.477s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If you recall, there is an ADA accessible ramp at the front of the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1430.86s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: My safety concerns, though, is that because it is there, that it opens us up to concern automatically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1440.646s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: As you think about it, there is no railing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1443.376s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: When I come out of the building at night from a concert, I have been concerned on many an occasion that someone could make a misstep in the lowered light, even though we've improved lighting there, but it'd be highly possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1458.92s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's for anybody, not only somebody who might also use the ramp, which might have some concerns, maybe wheelchair, whatever, it's clearly too steep for,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1473.043s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: safe wheelchair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1473.943s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So, but that is not the designated ADA ramp, but it exists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1481.065s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And again, it was put in for, you know, all of a sudden it appeared and there was a reason for its appearance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1487.586s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But for me personally, from the time it's gone in, I've been concerned about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1499.343s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You're at the front of the building, and you're looking at the doors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1502.543s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And the ramp is, part of it is stairs, but the ramp is right there on the left.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1512.265s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: No, no, it's outside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1516.426s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Outside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1517.446s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So you've probably been up and down it 1,000 times, Melanie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1540.27s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: For me, it's not so much an accessibility issue as my concern about what if someone makes a misstep off the side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6466.285s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I just wanted to ask if you could repeat, how are we getting permission for the students to get tested?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6474.748s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Will we have a blanket permission slip?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6476.868s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Will we have one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6478.389s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Could you just go over those, that again, please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6513.982s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And if parents opt out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6531.356s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And that will be confidential?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6536.667s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I'm just saying that the teacher will know who opts out and not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6565.203s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6567.283s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6567.563s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7450.317s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I was just going to say that it seems, you know, Mr. Rousseau is presenting certain information that Tony's unaware of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7457.338s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And that needs to be a private conversation between the two of them if information wants to be shared so that she can verify it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7466.44s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Because at this point, it's only, you know, working on hearsay, if you would.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7476.342s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7479.016s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So, you know, I just, I'm not privy to the details of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7484.059s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: None of us are, except perhaps the two of you, and somehow or another, it doesn't seem like it's really moving us ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7493.145s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It sounds like there's some will to have further discussion on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7497.308s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I have a hard time because I know I'm not an expert.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7501.535s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I know I'm a school committee member who has great intentions and wanna do the best for our kids, but I'm not an expert on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7508.637s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so that means that I have to listen to experts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7511.578s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And in some places I'm a little worried because I feel like some perhaps of my fellow school committee members think that they can interpret things in a better way than some of the experts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7523.442s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm not,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7525.683s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm feeling a little uncomfortable about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7528.125s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that we do need to move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7529.646s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If we're going to have a meeting on it, where the potential would be maybe next Monday, if I threw out a date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7538.773s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know what the will of the entire committee is at this point about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7543.177s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm definitely feeling uncertain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7546.359s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I understand arguments that I'm hearing, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7551.102s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, what are the major question is, I've heard some things about metrics and looking into how Tufts changes us, our potential numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7562.767s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Clearly, Mr. Rousseau is saying that the current policy that we have is not accurate and needs to be updated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7570.909s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But at the same time, I heard the superintendent say something about that it was being updated<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=9195.213s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=9200.865s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I just wanted to say thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=9202.465s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's really great to see the innovative ideas of our teachers and our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=9208.228s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Clearly, some of the photos we saw enjoying themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=9212.43s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm sure that behind each one of these, there's many more stories that could be told.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=9216.972s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But it's nice, especially when we have this kind of meeting, which has had its difficult points to then have this bright side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=9226.376s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you very much for your report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=9229.222s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10727.582s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I wanted to go back to the elementary portion and ask specifically two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10734.047s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: First, we talked a great deal about the Columbus second grade and bringing in a second teacher because of the unique circumstances that had happened, but I don't see that reflected in a split or have we brought in a second teacher?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10759.996s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10760.296s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Are they working in unison or have each taken a portion of the students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10790.399s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Right, especially as the students had begun, that actually makes a lot of sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10796.904s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Has the feedback from parents and students been positive?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10802.129s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So far, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10803.01s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10805.459s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The second question I had, and I just wanted to refer to it, is at the time when we discussed it two weeks ago, I had brought up the issue that you referenced that needing to change<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10816.918s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: some of the specialists, and I was quite concerned about that because I know for my own grandchild how important those specialists are to him, and were they changed, it would cause him great stress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10831.969s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I was very concerned when I had received some emails about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10836.672s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: One in particular stood out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10839.454s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I haven't received any out,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10843.076s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: input after that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10844.497s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm hoping that means that the new specialists have quickly, the kids have quickly adjusted, but that was something that was unexpected and I'm not totally sure whether it was, I know it hadn't been communicated to us, so I didn't understand it was happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10861.429s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Are we stable at this point with the specialists and are you getting any other feedback about that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10921.877s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10922.417s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I know, you know, in my own, obviously, I don't think it's the ideal situation by any, you know, stretch, but I think that what I'm hearing is really it's what you had to do in very unfortunate circumstances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10937.265s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So, you know, I keep on putting that, trying to put that into perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10940.286s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And, you know, today we had to, we were asked to submit videos for, to the McGlynn for their Medford Pride Day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10948.788s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And one of the things, words I had to use was flexible and proud of our students for being flexible, because I think that's such a key here and something that we have to keep on patting them on the back for, and also to our teachers and staff too about,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10966.232s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: striving to keep that flexibility as we work through these times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=10974.138s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Anyway, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11011.95s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, that's good to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11013.01s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I did not know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11013.87s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11014.43s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Great to hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=11015.211s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Suzanne.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=14933.338s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to thank you for the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=14938.804s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It really was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=14941.615s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: good to hear, although of course it's difficult to hear too, to think in our community, we have so many people who are food insecure, but thank you very much for the report and for your work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=282.938s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, Mia, I got you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=292.384s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to let everybody know that I was in on Wednesday to sign the bills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=301.73s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Right now I'm signing the bills on a bi-weekly basis, so I go in every other week until I hear any, until I'm given any other instructions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=313.619s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I am proceeding with and very thankful for our great people who are coming in to work to get the bills ready for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=491.598s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=493.9s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I read through it and I was comfortable with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=496.943s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I wanted to make sure that our administrative people also thought that it was workable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=540.035s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you to the subcommittee, and I'd like to make a motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1164.419s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1166.1s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I wanted to say thank you to Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1168.44s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Patterson as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1169.601s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Christine's worked very difficult and in a very demanding job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1175.362s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I would like to say almost a thankless job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1178.423s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I would like to thank her for her work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1182.024s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: dedication to her position, and I'd like to wish her well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1185.265s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it's certainly understandable that not driving quite as far as she drives, which is way too long, and being close to her daughter, even though it's going to be difficult to find someone in this very difficult position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1200.609s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But thank you, Kirsteen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=1202.89s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3080.974s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, this was discussed at the curriculum subcommittee and the subcommittee voted to bring it forth with a positive endorsement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3091.08s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: However, we didn't have the paperwork at the time, so that was given to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3095.482s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So at this point, I'd like to make a motion that we go ahead with the adoption of the new curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3100.866s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Just as a reminder, if any parents have concerns, they can opt their students out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3106.39s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But from what I hear, most more people are interested in making sure that their children have this valuable information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3113.736s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3114.237s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3115.898s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Sorry, Jenny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3116.959s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3118.76s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't care who seconds it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3709.238s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member van de Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3711.258s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Kirsteen, I just wanted to make sure, is the bus company presently and continuing to pay their employees?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3719.843s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: They are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3721.181s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3722.082s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And at the same time, the bus company, like all of those athletic trips that we would be taking now, we are not paying for, is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3732.53s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3733.391s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3734.492s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I would like to make a motion that we authorize you, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3738.375s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Patterson, to negotiate on our behalf as long as the bus company is committed to paying their employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3886.507s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I defer to Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3887.908s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Patterson to find out which way would she bring it back to us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4031.885s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I have a comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4033.706s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, member Vanden Heuvel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4042.408s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: the number of potential subcommittees we might be having.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4046.369s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think at this time, while we're under crisis, that we need to not have them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4052.571s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I don't know how many requests people have put in to have them, but I am concerned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4056.952s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we do need to limit the amount we're asking of our administrators until we get back to normal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4188.595s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4188.895s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think my concern is the number of subcommittee meetings, and I have no idea how many requests there were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4197.081s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so maybe I can just ask if the superintendent keep us abreast at how many are being asked for, because I just want to keep it real and appropriate for this particular time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=4213.732s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Obviously, you guys know I love going to subcommittee meetings, but it depends on, this is an unusual time and I think people are already taxed, so I want to make sure we're being smart about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=5054.535s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Including our grocery store workers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=5057.879s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: and our healthcare workers and our emergency people, all of those people who need our support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=5157.019s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So the school committee made a motion that everybody, all of our employees would be paid until May 4th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=5165.863s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And at that time we will revisit this decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=5170.385s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=5181.095s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=5186.616s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: On that motion, by the way, it was made by Paul Rousseau and seconded by?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=622.287s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member van de Kloot, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=623.568s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Lungo-Koehn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=644.088s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=646.643s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So the curriculum subcommittee met on Wednesday, February 26, between 4.30 and 5.30 at the superintendent's conference room in Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=655.771s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: In attendance were the subcommittee members, myself and Jenny Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=660.495s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mia was absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=661.756s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: School committee member Paul Rousseau<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=664.993s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: attended the meeting, as did Superintendent Maryse Edward-Vincent, Associate Superintendent Diane Caldwell, Assistant Superintendent Peter Cushing, Director of Curriculum and Instruction Bernadette Riccidelli, Director of PE Health Rachel Puri, and Middle School Parent Michelle Ciccolo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=682.438s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I called the meeting together at 435 and we saluted the flag.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=686.599s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The purpose of the meeting was to review proposed additions to the middle school health curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=691.109s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We received handouts from Rachel Puri, including the table of contents for the national health standards and a table reviewing the current Medford health curriculum with the national standards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=701.752s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Areas where we were not in alignment were highlighted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=704.853s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Director Puri reviewed the charts with the subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=707.733s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Currently we use part of the Michigan model, but now we should be incorporating more areas of the most recent Michigan model edition to cover areas related to sexual health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=718.703s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We are covering areas such as vaping, alcohol, drug education, nutrition, physical activity, safety, and other areas of social emotional learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=726.833s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Currently, the state standards are not out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=729.336s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So at present, we need to rely on the national standards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=732.938s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Director Perry explained the health is offered for a half year in grade six, seventh, and eighth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=737.48s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The other half of the year, the students receive instruction from guidance in order to cover the new areas of instruction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=743.964s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: In order to cover the new areas of instruction, one full-time health teacher will be needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=750.367s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Graham asked about the trade-off between students receiving health versus the ability to participate in band or orchestra.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=758.132s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Parent Ciccolo noted that her child had no health in sixth grade because of a conflict with orchestra,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=763.143s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: In seventh grade, her child traded phys ed in order to get health instruction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=767.645s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: School committee member Rousseau noted that often students on IEPs miss subjects like health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=773.327s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Assistant Superintendent Peter Cushing said that our kids are under a constant bombardment on vaping and other risky behaviors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=780.89s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: He believes a trained health professional is of highest priority, a must have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=785.712s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Guiding staff not trained to teach these health areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=789.066s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The superintendent concurred and noted that budget decisions are going to be tough because of the many needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=794.768s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Since the new curriculum covers areas related to sex education, such as gender identity, anatomy, puberty, and contraception, all parents will receive the opt-out notification, which the district has used for many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=807.592s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The sequencing of the curriculum will be given careful consideration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=810.855s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The high school ninth grade health class will be reviewed and updated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=814.759s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Scheduling at the middle school is challenging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=816.941s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Graham offered the following statement to summarize our current position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=821.325s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We recognize that there are scheduling issues that mean parents have to make choices that we would rather they did not have to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=828.891s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We are very aware of the issues and are working to address them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=832.443s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Motion by Member Graham, seconded by myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=835.284s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The Curriculum Subcommittee recommends that the school committee adopt Growing Up and Staying Healthy Michigan model health curriculum with supplements in order to assure that we are aligned with the national health standards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=848.648s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Roll call was Graham, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=850.849s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=851.789s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=851.91s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Stone was absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=853.15s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Motion to adjourn at 5.30 by Member Graham and seconded by myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=858.252s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And the motion passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=860.478s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So we would like to make a motion tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=864.482s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We would ask that the school committee adopt, recommendation is that we adopt growing up, the subcommittee recommendation is that we adopt growing up and staying healthy, the Michigan model health curriculum with supplements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=902.12s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=902.681s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think there were resources that the teachers would be using.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=909.388s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: They were not specified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=911.45s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: However, we did address the needs of the fact that there was concerns about getting the curriculum to everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=918.298s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's one of the reasons why the recommendation is to add a full-time health<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=924.817s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: teacher at that level, because we need to be more comprehensive in our ability to deliver the information to students, all students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1084.232s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Am I correct in saying when it's tabled, it's tabled?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1089.939s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1092.703s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1101.693s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: »» Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1102.033s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Can I make a clarification?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1103.153s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: »» Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1103.993s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: »» The reason I motioned to table it was because a member asked for additional information that I did not provide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1112.115s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Because typically when we've had a handout we don't always provide it that's not customary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1117.576s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But I didn't provide it and since a member asked for that information and we didn't provide it, that's why I made the motion to lay it on the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1157.87s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, if I may, there's also a budget piece of getting a, whether we're going to approve the additional health personnel, which is going to make this possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1168.855s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, I absolutely understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1171.356s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that as soon as a member requests a piece of information, I mean, the mayor just said, I don't feel comfortable voting on it unless I see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1179.76s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, so, uh, it would be as you and I both being on the subcommittee, we very, very much want to see this go through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1186.244s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1187.546s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: At this point, I'm willing to wait for two weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1189.888s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I would not have to read the minutes again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1191.529s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We would just have to bring it back up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1197.833s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'll lay it on the table to the next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1201.296s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Ruseau?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1390.365s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Lungo-Koehn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1391.929s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd like to ask for suspension of, oh, sorry, not yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1395.731s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Hold on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1623.316s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1626.338s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I had a question about the timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1629.239s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I also, I guess my first question is, did the subcommittee endorse, I don't see a motion for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1638.444s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Was there, sorry, where is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1646.608s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And was it a three to one vote?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1649.129s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Or a three to zero vote?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1650.049s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1652.122s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I have a question about, okay, here, I see it now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1656.665s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I have a question about the timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1661.328s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It appears that it gives the superintendent or her designee within two normal school days to respond with the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1673.257s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, when I'm up there signing the bills on Wednesday, I have to say that my observation is that people are running, running, running, juggling so many balls in the air.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1685.042s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't think two normal school days is sufficient.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1688.423s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I understand everybody thinks that whatever they have, as do I, is the most pressing issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1695.206s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But I don't think that's real to hold the superintendent to, and I don't want her to be under pressure to simply<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1703.32s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: designating something to everybody else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1705.301s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And then sometimes she may need to think about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1708.281s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I don't find two days to be sufficient.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=1712.622s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I would ask the superintendent, since this affects you directly, is what sort of timeline you would think would be reasonable?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2331.917s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member van de Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2333.72s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Sure, so first I want to say I do appreciate the work that the subcommittee did on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2338.543s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The superintendent has indicated her willingness to try it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2343.867s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: My concern, again, just stands, perhaps I would change it to three normal school days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2349.011s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm trying to work through my head.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2350.632s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, it's written on Sunday, it gets sent so it's received Monday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2354.935s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That means the expectation is that it would get answered by Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2358.633s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: afternoon, but all hell breaks out loose on Monday and Tuesday they're running about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2363.757s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So, you know, again, part of me just, I absolutely understand, you know, what the intent is and I think we are all reasonable people, but I'm always concerned when we write policy like this that someone then could come along and be holding, hold the superintendent to something that we agreed would be flexible and we're trying out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2388.664s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so, to me, it just seems very quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2392.626s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'd be more comfortable with a three-day return, personally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2398.569s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I would go, certainly, with asking the rest of the school committee whether, you know, I'll make a motion that the response within three normal school days as opposed to two, and you either vote up or down, and I'm happy to take whatever the consensus is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2415.037s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I make a motion, if anybody wants to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2417.901s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, approve it or second it, that'd be three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2423.042s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, thank you, Kathy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2431.344s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Kreatz?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2652.955s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2653.615s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: All those opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2654.776s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It should be a roll call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2656.257s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Roll call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2664.464s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Van der Kloot, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2665.584s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Lungo-Koehn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2666.545s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2839.053s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2839.613s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Can we take a copy of your statement?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2841.675s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2841.775s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is that OK?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2843.577s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2845.723s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I would recommend that we take this and put it under consideration so that we can take a look at in-depth of your proposals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2857.334s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm also very glad that you acknowledged<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2861.858s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: so much that the district has made grave strides in these last months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2867.382s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2870.225s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Can I take that one and we can make a copy and send it back to you maybe?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2874.568s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I can have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2875.148s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2875.448s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=2942.275s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: All in favor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=3337.737s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member van de Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=3339.199s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I also wanted to add my thanks Diane and not only for all of your years but I have to emphasize for the last two years because you really were the constant in the office who helped us through the transition of superintendents and that was just an incredibly important<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=3356.339s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: role for you to play and you know you could have looked around and said oh I don't think so but instead you chose to stay and to be the transition link and so I think for that not only for that but also for your many years back I remember when you were teaching at the Curtis Tufts and I always thought you were something special so thank you very very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4535.941s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4537.622s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4537.962s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4540.044s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I'd like to go back and talk about the coronavirus more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4545.646s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: What I'm particularly interested in is our proactive plans to talk about education if we were to have to close the schools for a week or two or whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4559.95s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, at this point, I understand it's speculative, but I think planning would help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4607.52s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Great, I'd love to see homework packets put together, you know, and if possible, or even, you know, read with your child two times for 20 minutes every day or something while whatever break we're on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4632.631s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And the other concern I have, just with that, that goes hand in hand, is that some of our students are reliant on two meals a day through the public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4644.027s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And at least, like I'm thinking at the high school level, we've got the pantry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4649.404s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: could those students be encouraged to take more?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4652.987s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And if the pantry needs more food, could you put a call out to the community so we can fill it up right now so that there's more food available?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4661.395s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm thinking about other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4663.036s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, all of a sudden, you know, we have students who would be home and not accessing our food.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4667.981s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: How can we make sure that we're being proactive and thinking about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4671.863s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: supplying some food to families that might be in a particular vulnerable place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4680.246s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So anyway, I'm glad to hear the administrators are getting together tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4684.388s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=4731.548s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm hoping that we will do this, send home information so that we don't get to a Monday morning and all of a sudden cancel and the kids haven't received anything on Friday afternoon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5457.154s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: to something my colleague said that there would be our teachers and staff and whatever would continue on their regular pay scale as per contract whether we close or not that that would not affect our personnel in terms of being paid and it I'm not sure that's what you said but that's what it sounded like okay just want to be clear<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5510.68s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The blessing is right now is that we have quite a number of days still left.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5515.864s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So because of the light snow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5518.185s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But saying that, I probably, there was a year, so I won't say anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5963.47s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So did all of the students buy the cancel for any reason insurance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5969.953s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5970.393s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And at this point in the time window, do I understand they'll only get 50% back?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5976.315s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=5976.956s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And we've had no talks with the company to say whether that could be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=6024.874s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So within that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=6028.095s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: In terms of the airfare, some airlines are allowing waves or will give credit for future trips.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=6036.498s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: What were you planning on flying?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=6068.881s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I hope that we could look into that, because it's quite a hit for a family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=6072.763s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, it's a disappointment for students, and I feel terrible about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=6077.685s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so anything that we can at least get the most money back for the families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=6084.44s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: thought or discussion of saying, could we do the trip during the summer instead?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=6240.74s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you for all your work and effort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=6242.481s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I can feel your pain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=6243.942s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I really appreciate your thoughtful answer and the fact that you had to make this tough decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=6250.225s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9285.644s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I believe I can concur with Melanie on many of the points that she makes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9294.437s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's not reasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9295.278s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It never was a reasonable timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9298.323s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It seems ludicrous that they're asking for such a quick return across the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9303.526s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: My mom used to say, it never hurts to ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9306.167s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think putting together a well-crafted letter saying we would respectfully ask you for more time, we don't believe that this is an adequate amount of time for us to engage our families and whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9318.293s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, I would absolutely submit it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9320.655s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I would actually go further and talk to the other<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9323.476s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: superintendents who are also grappling with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9325.939s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Maybe there's a few who've managed to figure it out, but I bet there's a whole lot of superintendents trying to slam this together, as we will be doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9335.428s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But on the other hand, I'm not willing to leave money on the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9339.151s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I think we need to go ahead and send it to the engagement committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9343.173s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we need to write the letter because nothing ventured, nothing gained, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9347.955s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That we should do that and hope for the best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9351.057s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And in the meantime, do whatever work we can do so that we are prepared to file what we have, whether it's perfect or not, because I'm not going to leave $138,000 on the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9362.683s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I can think of many, many different things that we've talked in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9367.225s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: that might be helpful to our students and to all students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9372.247s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9373.828s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Point of clarification, member Ruseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/T943Bcjm1yk&t=9390.335s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So if we don't submit the plan we automatically still get the money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=955.24s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Lungo-Koehn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1840.168s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I think my colleagues have summed up many of the discussion points, but I feel particularly disheartened to hear from Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1846.973s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Donlon that any student felt that they were getting negative feedback because of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1853.398s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I just want to say, and add my voice, that I applaud you for coming forward and for advocating for yourself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1859.122s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That is exactly what we want you to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=1861.524s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And we're appreciative of your time and presence here this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2173.556s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: While we heard from students involved in the after school program, we have other students who work for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2179.64s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And it would only be equitable to understand the full breadth of student employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2186.705s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: For instance, we have students who are lifeguards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2188.527s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That's part of the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2894.273s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I have several things to bring to your attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2897.434s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: At our last school committee meeting, Member McLaughlin asked, and it was reflected in our minutes, about the conversations with non-English speaking families from the health office, and we talked about a translation service that were used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2916.081s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I pulled one of the bills so that you could see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2920.103s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I want to note that the names that are on it are not student names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2923.644s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: They are, in fact, the employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2925.185s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But I thought you would just be interested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2927.026s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You can see that sometimes the conference is only two minutes, and sometimes it's 14 minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2933.571s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But this is that we employ a service to help with the translation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2938.074s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I brought that in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2939.195s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm going to pass them around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2940.396s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I would ask that they all, they are copies, but if you just return them to me, I'd appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2945.399s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Secondarily, and this is kind of an ode to my former colleague, our former colleague, Erinda Benedetto, I pulled a bill that was for professional cleaning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2957.45s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Whenever I see professional odor remediation services that piqued my interest so I followed it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2964.436s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It had to do with the Curtis-Tufts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2966.878s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: They had a problem in the library classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2970.702s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So on December 26th, when students were not in the building, they brought in ServPro to help remediate that issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2979.889s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so you'll see that bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2983.251s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Lastly, I just thought you might be interested that we have received new textbooks for our students for our civic education in grade 7.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2991.537s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I brought in the bills for you to see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=2993.978s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Unfortunately, much to my dismay, I realized that they are already out of date as I couldn't help but look under impeach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=3001.799s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And it mentioned that only, you know, two presidents have been impeached.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=3006.46s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so, we are obviously, our teachers are going to have to update that information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=3011.601s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But there is also a teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=3012.981s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So, I brought them in just so you could see and know that these resources have been brought to our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=3018.843s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=3038.802s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: One further thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=3040.342s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to extend again an invitation to any other member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=3044.083s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I've been getting there on Wednesdays about 10, 15.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=3047.263s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And if anybody does want to join me, if you give me a heads up, then I'll make sure my timing's more exact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=3051.944s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But please do feel free to come and join on Wednesdays up at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5943.644s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5944.833s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Member van de Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5946.734s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Just one thing in the timeline that doesn't make sense to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5950.157s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I note that the sibling opt-in, opt-out form is due on March 4th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5957.322s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But the open houses, the three of them occur after that deadline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=5964.247s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So for me, it would make more sense for the sibling opt-in, opt-out form to be sent home, to be due on March 11th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6040.704s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But, you know, with... If it would work such that the sibling opt-in, opt-out form<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6047.749s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: is not a drop-dead, but which is to say that instead they'd be collected with the ideal on March 4th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6054.731s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But if there were forms that were not turned in, there would be follow-up with the parent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6060.473s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I would be comfortable with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6064.274s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But that's a procedural thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6066.014s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If it's meant that if the parent doesn't return the form by that date,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6072.859s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: then I'm not particular, you know, one way or the other, then I'm not particularly comfortable with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6077.825s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But I assume you'd be following up with it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6089.133s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6090.214s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If you can make that, that makes them more comfortable with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=6095.4s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=7998.591s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8004.832s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I support the resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8006.713s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It sounds like where we're heading is that we're going to need to do some specialized preschool information directed to preschool parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8016.98s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Especially, we have the Medford Family Network.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8019.061s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We have parents we can outreach to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8022.383s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I know one year I went and I was very disheartened by how many of those parents, it just happened that year, were going to charter schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8033.214s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So it seems like with the feedback from my colleagues that it's definitely time to think about an earlier outreach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8042.384s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that these presentations are great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8044.466s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I know the staff does a fabulous job on them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8048.491s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But clearly, we're going to need to think about sooner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=8053.116s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=9562.335s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, so thank you for all the work to the team who's been putting and working on this document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=9568.62s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Just for our clarity, I believe my understanding is that for each of the bullets, you'd hyperlink to a page that would outline in detail the steps needed<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=9581.454s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: to achieve and the person in charge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=9587.178s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Of the bullets that we have here, roughly 16, 17, how many have we done that next step for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=9596.585s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Or is that the next step?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=9692.012s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If I can just follow up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=9693.793s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Moving forward, what do you envision now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=9696.576s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you envision it going to the subcommittee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=9816.201s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11294.135s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I, now that we've officially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11297.077s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She loves that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11297.718s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You're promoted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11298.398s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm out of here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11310.848s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So, given that we are now official, I'd like to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11317.413s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Announce that the curriculum subcommittee is going to meet on Wednesday at 6 o'clock between 6 and 7.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11325.801s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We are meeting at the request of associate superintendent Diane Caldwell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11331.92s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: for a presentation on enhanced core reading instruction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11337.081s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We did the unusual step of going ahead and setting up the meeting prior to sending it to the subcommittee officially from this body because of a timeline issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11348.024s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I hope that no one has any concern or objection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11352.645s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So that will be on this Wednesday, February 5th at 6 o'clock up at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11359.312s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11360.052s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Also, while we're under this, I noticed that we haven't yet received any appointees to the vision committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11367.877s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I just want to ask the mayor what her intention was about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11393.575s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11394.415s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11848.657s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: May I ask a question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11854.282s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11854.382s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanna make sure, this is one of those circumstances where we have a meeting immediately after a vacation week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11861.902s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so given that timeline, is that meeting the best meeting to do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11871.135s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Are you prepared at that point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11894.163s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I only raise it only because of the fact it is right after, and you know, some people are on vacation, but not all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11901.645s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Anyway, thank you, and I would support it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11904.027s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So motion for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11905.949s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11972.463s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think the point of sending it to the subcommittee is so you can argue it out there about saying what makes sense to send, what's an ad hoc report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11985.552s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: and does something like this qualify and how do you discern?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=11989.454s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's kind of my thinking about it is that there'll be multiple interesting discussions about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=12000.158s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That's why it's going to subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=12006.281s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Not this resolution, what she's referring to with the ad hoc report, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=12013.924s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, future resolutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=12019.488s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, you're going to have to figure that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1438.368s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Hi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1438.908s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I noticed that quite a number of people have been brought on after the start of school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1443.271s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So, for example, let's just use the paraprofessionals that have been brought on, say, in October.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1448.774s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There's one October 8th, one October 15th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1451.355s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The second one, et cetera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1453.738s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So at the beginning of the school, we have many new employee induction programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1462.157s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: people are hired and have a later arrival.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1466.121s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: How are we making sure that they are up to date on all of the information they need to or would have gotten had they been hired in an earlier time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1506.509s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Do we have some sort of check-off list to make sure, for example, that everybody is aware of our emergency plans?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1521.929s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, I think we need to follow that through at some point, so thank you for that information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1527.291s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The second question is, I noticed cheerfully that we have hired quite a few people in the after-school program, and I would like to ask for a update on the after-school program at a meeting in the near future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1550.016s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thirdly, one last, I understand we have a teacher out, a science teacher out and at, oh I think it's the Andrews 8th grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1561.809s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: and parents were concerned about who was going to replace the teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1568.153s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And Dr. Maurice, you and I corresponded about this, saying that right now it was a certified teacher, but not certified in science.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1579.16s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So the question is, is are we seeking a certified<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1582.522s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: science teacher to replace that, because I think that there is concern, especially given that the students had a teacher, the same group of students had a teacher out last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1593.385s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's two years in a row that they would be having a non, or I don't know who took the place last year, but I do know right now that we have a person in there who may be terrific, I don't know, but is not certified in science.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1653.173s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1653.433s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Could you provide us with an update on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1657.014s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And also again, because of the concern, I would like to ask that, you know, the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1663.928s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: the new teacher be monitored carefully just to make sure that he or she is doing whatever they're supposed to be doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1673.35s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5484.488s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: A couple of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5485.609s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think, just as a comment, I think that my initial reading of this was I was almost a little disappointed, and people have touched on this, that we weren't doing the DIBLS 8 at one of our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5497.176s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Because just from a kind of common sense place of where we're sitting is, oh, that means that we're testing different assessment tools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5508.911s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: and getting an idea of how they work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5510.612s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: However, I did read carefully your sentence that you put in here about saying that you guys have truly looked at both of them and saw them to be comparable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5521.579s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So, but that's, you know, it's kind of almost a common sense that my initial reaction was saying, oh wait, they're not doing DIBLS-8?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5528.363s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I thought we should be because we should be looking at all of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5531.785s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The next thing is we were passing around the colored<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5535.948s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: places, pieces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5537.369s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so I wanted to know what you do for a child who's colorblind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5541.833s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you first assess whether they're colorblind?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5552.148s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, and with those, the students, the idea is how fast the students can read those?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5580.736s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5581.416s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And a student who's coming in who has been speaking a different language?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5607.34s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5608.021s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5608.581s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And my last comment really is, and this really comes from speaking to my own daughter recently, recently, and the whole question of dyslexic, and she is dyslexic and was not identified until really till older in high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5626.831s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But she said to me, well, mom, of course we should have known because I was always in the low reading group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5631.953s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: and made clear the pain of being stigmatized in the low reading group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5639.38s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And here we're talking a lot about taking students and determining what they know can do and not, but it also opens up and raises the concern of saying that those kids then are grouped together as the poor readers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5653.913s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I just, I don't know how we're doing that today, but Nicole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5738.076s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Just one last, because you brought it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5739.937s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So one of the interesting things about my daughter, she can read on a computer screen much, much easier than she can read on a page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5746.322s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So how do we differentiate when we're giving a computer test for those kids for her who might struggle with the written page?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6700.078s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6701.759s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The increase, say, between the last year and this new year one, do you know what that is approximately?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6709.104s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's roughly 4%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6724.717s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6725.638s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7062.21s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: To my colleague, it would make more sense for you to make the motion that prior to the next implementation or prior to the next time contract that we do a study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7075.957s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Because to do it in December, well now, then another two and three quarter years are going to pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7082.601s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So the information will be current, but if you make the motion that prior to the next time we go out to renew the contract, we do that cost analysis between in-house and out-house or outside, that would make much more sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7098.355s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So if I could ask you to reword it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7130.273s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7130.493s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7131.913s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The other thing I just want to remind my colleague is that, while I understand that it sounds great to say, well, we want to give Medford people jobs, this company may be employing Medford people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7145.176s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know who the employees are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7147.177s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I do know that there were multiple employees who have already worked for the company.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7153.098s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so to just, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7158.3s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: While it may sound great, that statement may sound great, I think it's superficial because the fact of the matter is that there are probably people, I know that we have gotten good feedback on the employees, and I'd hate to just put them out of work because we had some other thought of, oh, Medford people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7176.134s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, maybe they are Medford people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7179.076s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's a little more complex than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7183.037s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There is a motion for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=645.948s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: As I said to Joseph coming in, it's such an honor<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=659.248s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: to know him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=660.049s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And it was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=661.349s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's nothing new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=662.39s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We're so excited over the years watching you grow and your family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=666.392s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And thank you to the FARA parents as well, who have been so supportive, of course, of their kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=672.596s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's been so great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=674.097s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And, you know, this is one of those moments, I think, that when I live a very long and healthy life, I'm going to say, I knew him when.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=683.943s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's just great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=685.404s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you so much, Joseph.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1660.809s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1661.729s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I thought about this a lot, and because I was disappointed that students who really would have liked to have gone to the March<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1672.054s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: didn't go because they would have adversely affected their team because they're not allowed to take part in those activities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1682.942s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But to me, while there was a question of timing, it happened quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1688.787s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We only knew about it, or I only knew about it the day before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1692.75s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: To me, this is a school committee policy question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1696.485s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And to me, I feel like the administrative people probably are doing their job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1702.112s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And now I have to step in and say, this is a policy question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1705.816s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we need to look at the policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1707.771s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't think that students should be penalized for attending a climate change march.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1713.696s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd love it to be an educational opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1716.758s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I would even consider some sort of, I mean, I agree with Paul that that distinction between excused and unexcused, perhaps we need to talk about that overall because I've had parents come to me<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1730.689s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: with frustration about that policy in the bigger sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1736.093s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Because they say, you know, my kid was sick, but not so sick that they needed to go to the doctor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1741.496s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just put aside over to the left and say, we have a bigger question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1747.3s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But I do believe it's a policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1750.222s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'd like to make a motion that the school committee meet to discuss the absentee policy, especially in regards to outside events.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1760.567s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: that students would like to participate in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1762.829s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that if we can sit down around the table and come to a better way to handle this, that this would be better for our students, and then we wouldn't be putting our administrators, you know, holding them up with annoyance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=1779.704s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So, if I could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2557.346s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to be clear that by asking to send this to the policy committee, it's not because in any way that I agree with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2564.231s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I didn't agree with the choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2566.413s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's just because I'm taking the power that we have as school committee members, and that is to make and set policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2573.538s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think that's the way that we can go about it and craft what we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2578.582s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: will agree on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2580.043s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I also just want to mention in all of this, the one thing that I kept on thinking about was that lovely young lady that came to us last spring, wanting to bring to our attention her frustration with the styrofoam trays.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2593.99s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think now it's September, and I know we're working on it, but yet it doesn't feel like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2605.512s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: we're really concerned enough, because if we're concerned enough, then price wouldn't be a matter, and we would get reusable trays.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2612.257s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I was at Tufts yesterday, at the Tufts Community Day, and I noticed all the plates were, they're recycled paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2619.622s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I'm concerned that our own body isn't feeling the pressure enough, that we're gonna get to it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2631.957s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: but we're not getting to it fast enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2634.018s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think that it's up to us when we have a student like this, and we all agreed, we all agreed what we should do, that we should make it happen, not wait until it happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2699.328s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It may be trickier than you think because the excused and unexcused, I mean, I'm not sure that matters as much as, and I don't think we can go back and unfortunately change the fact that the real issue was they couldn't participate in their extracurriculars if they went.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2726.977s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And that's what is at the real meat of this, is that that's what the problem was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2735.265s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not certain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2739.652s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So just as I try to think about this and I may need some help from the administration here of saying we could ask students if they went to the climate change on Friday, I guess that's how we would identify who went as opposed to who was sick or who was whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2757.92s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not quite sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2759.301s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we kind of need to look at our policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2761.122s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm not against it, Michael.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2763.363s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm just not quite sure how to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2766.417s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We could, it doesn't have to be decided tonight, we could go to that policy, the policy subcommittee and we could discuss it there and it could be retroactive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2776.799s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Would that be okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3778.243s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I commend Kathy for volunteering to be the chair, and she may very well end up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3783.188s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: In previous times when we did, I was on both the Building the Future 1 and Building the Future 2, and part of the much larger community group that was on it, the mayor appointed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3794.078s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And that is typical, in my experience on the school committee, is that the mayor appoints who's going to be on a committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3800.744s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Just as we did with the superintendent search,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3803.827s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We asked the community who was interested in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4276.546s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to mention that I was up at Tufts and I saw Diane Caldwell giving out these bookmarks that had been made by our Graphic Arts Department, a nice little PR piece, and I wanted to express my appreciation to Diane for sitting in the sun, as well as I believe Lisa was there earlier, Lisa Evangelista, and also to the CCSR students who were present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4300.234s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It was a hot day, but very, very nice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6997.687s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I just wanted to ask you about the grade implementation, because on one it says K to 2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7004.31s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Are we doing K to 2 students in all the schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7013.675s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And when we, is this a one-on-one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7066.255s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think at some point, if it's possible, once they get a little bit of practice, I think it would be great if school committee members who are available could go and watch an implementation, see what a child is doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3857.629s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So, I would think that it seems to me that there is a leap of faith here, to some extent, by going with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3866.679s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Because we have the statistics between two of our schools, and someone answered about a bus being late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3874.668s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I'm sure hoping that the principal who's meeting that bus that is late is the caring individual who we know that they are and who will usher that it's not a, you know, all of a sudden breakfast is going to close and the door is closed and there's no chance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3891.176s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: When I was a guidance Councilor over in Everett, there was a child who consistently came late to school and we knew had no food.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3901.101s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I want to tell you, we always managed to get that child food by going down to the kitchen, by getting help, and we had no breakfast program at that time set up for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3910.326s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But there are caring individuals in our buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3913.127s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I am sure that there are other people in our buildings who want to make this work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3917.549s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm betting on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3919.15s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I'm going to bet on that and vote for approval of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3923.332s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And then see, we might have kinks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3926.013s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We might have to work it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3927.454s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We might have to revisit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3928.995s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But I'm at least willing to try it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3930.676s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's where I'll come down tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=4127.191s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Burke, well I'll speak to this for just a moment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=4130.313s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's indeed wonderful to see how well Superintendent Maurice-Edouard Vincent has done this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=4137.916s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The fact that she got unanimous support and that we all recognize that this has been a very strong first year for her and she's got such potential for growing from where she's at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=4150.223s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's truly been a great year to be able to work with her and be able to, for all of us to recognize this tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=4158.751s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=4159.872s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is there a motion on the floor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=4162.335s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: For approval?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=4163.075s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=4163.396s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We have something we have to do before the end, just with the budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=4172.184s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Christine's very concerned, so that's why I wanted to make sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=4178.247s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Right, we haven't approved the budget yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=756.26s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd like to make a motion to suspend the usual order of business so we can take up item number four, recognition of student achievements, humanities awards, today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2391.148s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I would also like to thank the parent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2392.75s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I want to tell you that I wish that many years ago when my youngest, I didn't realize, we didn't know until much later that she was dyslexic, and it's actually impacted her whole life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2405.7s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: With that being said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2407.065s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it would make sense for us to again suspend the order of business and go directly to the reports on dyslexia since we've now gotten into the topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4196.022s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4197.703s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4197.983s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4199.564s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4199.825s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just was curious whether there is any indication that for preschoolers, I mean, is this something that can be seen even earlier for a parent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4213.156s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Are there particular sort of warning signs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4241.963s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The other question is the parent who came before us noted that her student had in fact been given some remediation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4248.846s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: How do we figure out what's the best way to help a student?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4255.608s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We'll go with the model that the student has been screened early.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4258.929s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: What is the approach that we're going to best meet the needs of a student who falls into that category?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4346.288s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Who do you think is doing a particularly good job, if we think about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4351.034s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: districts you've worked with?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4395.239s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7026.215s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: First, I also would like to give a shout out to Nicole Chin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7030.7s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Nicole was the CCSR student who really organized that dinner on Friday night, and she and her devoted parents did such a wonderful job pulling that event together, and I think everybody had a great time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7044.42s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And it was great to celebrate the students as well as to see those senior students who received $500 scholarships.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7053.086s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So it was a great, great night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7055.007s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd like to go back to the beginning where you talked about the middle school lottery, Superintendent, if I could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7062.071s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7063.402s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I sort of have two different sort of series of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7067.164s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it's important to look back at the process and say what worked well, what didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7073.529s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so in reflecting on that, I was curious how much the outside CPA firm cost and whether it was worth it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7082.094s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And if we were to do it again, whether we would need an outside firm?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7106.09s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Was it worth it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7106.691s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If we did it again, would we need it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7137.231s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I absolutely understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7138.891s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to know, and it was important to create a baseline of making sure that it was transparent and clear and whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7146.532s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But of course, having said that, I'm sure others have received, too, discussion from parents still asking, is there another way?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7154.974s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think that it's important now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7156.534s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I know that in the time that you came in,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7161.855s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: and did a quick evaluation and say, this year this is the best way to do it, that we didn't really afford the timetable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7170.837s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But I think it's important now to take a step back and to say, is there another way?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7176.978s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Does it make sense for all the 6th graders to be in one place and divide up the 7th or 8th grade class so that they all know each other?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7311.705s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I always feel the urge, though, as we discuss this, and I very much would like to see that feasibility study, and that's the reason why I'm bringing it up tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7319.431s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And it doesn't sound like I need to make a motion because it seems like it's clearly part<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7324.255s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: your direction, but of course I want the school committee member to be very much involved with the discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7329.34s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But I do, I always think that just from a historical perspective, it's very important that the community realize that the reason why we built the two schools in the way that we did was that because it enabled us to get 90% funding from the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7345.414s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so the cost of our buildings, these magnificent buildings, was a very small cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7352.221s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And as I always have listened to other districts and heard when someone came and talked to me today about what's going on in their district,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7358.68s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I said, well, how much is the state going to be able to contribute?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7363.464s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And it was opposite.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7365.325s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It was like 10%, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7367.007s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And that is why we ended up with the K to 8 in one building in the middle school, 6th, 7th, and 8th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7376.114s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But now many years have passed, and it's time to take a look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7414.717s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It was a team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7415.618s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But did you get up and dance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7446.616s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Motion to accept.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7448.017s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7449.078s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7450.539s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Call it, Kathy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7452.181s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7452.501s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: All in favor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7453.809s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: No, you have to do it, it's money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7454.91s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, okay, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7466.217s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8298.522s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8394.069s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8394.689s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8395.33s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8395.65s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Vendicott.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8397.051s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So, I feel like I'm a little confused because I think we're mixing a lot of different things in that there's different issues here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8405.079s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Paul, you're raising the question of the calendar scheduling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8410.824s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that the tie-in was where is the money going?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8415.789s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But we have received<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8418.079s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: reports from Christine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8419.64s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We did look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8420.941s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It was somewhere, I don't remember, back at some point or another, maybe it was a year ago, where we looked at it and we saw, and at that time no one had any questions about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8430.107s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It was all detailed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8432.388s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So maybe, you know, again, we should look at what date we did that and we should do it again on a yearly basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8438.432s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And in fact, I think that the motion at the time was that we would be doing it at a yearly basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8444.088s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So that's sort of in one pot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8447.251s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The report that we got today was on student activity accounts, which is different, but maybe we want them side to side with the friends of, so that we can say, gee, it's interesting, girls basketball, and I'm just picking one up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8463.476s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: out of the blue with, you know, has both a student activity account and it has this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8470.218s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It also is a friends of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8472.339s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's because I think that's, Erin, what you're talking about is sort of saying, gee, there are some things that aren't listed here, which I thought they would come up with a student activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8481.121s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: No, a student activity account is different than what we talked about earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8486.102s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just, I need to make some lines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8488.523s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we, you know, when you throw it all into the same<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8492.3s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: motion, it doesn't make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8496.104s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8497.445s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So, having said that, it's... Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8506.913s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Can I think about it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8508.234s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't want to do it right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8510.176s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So let's...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8644.188s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8648.277s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: To my colleague, I think it would make sense if we reviewed that in October as a group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8653.46s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't think we need to make a motion right at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8656.101s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That would be my suggestion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8711.838s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Resolutions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8713.359s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Oh, excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8827.155s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Motion to adjourn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8828.931s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: To executive session?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8830.532s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8830.812s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8830.932s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Do we have to vote for that, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=2259.938s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=2262.583s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to follow up and I wonder whether you've ever faced this kind of situation at one of the schools that you oversaw or the principal of and what did you do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=2380.56s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Was there any special education students or students with disabilities that you had to make arrangements for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=2884.284s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to know whether you had any questions for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=4945.526s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Very nice stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=4947.868s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This is a budget scenario.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=5165.92s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=5167.881s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you have any questions for us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=5172.162s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Excuse me, do you have any questions for us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=267.105s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Hi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=270.487s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think it would be helpful if we understood a little bit more about your current job capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=276.712s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Boston is a little bit unknown to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=280.574s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so if you could explain exactly what you do in your current position, that would be extremely helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=367.419s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm not sure if- When you say instructional focus, are you meaning instruction curriculum overall, or are you, is there different instructional methods that differentiate the schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=506.928s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So tell me about one of the biggest challenges in working in your current position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=572.985s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But what is your challenge?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2915.003s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We've spoken about some of your successes, but I want to hear how you've been tested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2921.35s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So could you speak about, I'll say, two occasions where you did not succeed in something or where you actually failed and what you learned from it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2946.843s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It could be like an implementation of a program not going well or an interaction with a student's family for something, whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3096.67s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3097.73s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3098.01s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3099.77s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Can I ask another one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3100.631s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3101.091s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3103.791s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So we've touched a little bit on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3105.432s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You mentioned this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3107.052s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the things that students are presenting with is increasing levels of anxiety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3111.437s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: How do you balance the emotional needs of the students while maintaining academic rigor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3117.181s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And can you give me any specific examples how you've handled that in your schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5693.313s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: A couple of them, but they're short.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5696.554s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So just budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5698.175s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: When you did your superintendent training, did you have experience with a particular budget in a particular community during that training?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5711.334s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: No, just, I didn't know if you worked with a particular mentor in a particular community that did budget with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5717.516s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just didn't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5730.454s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Not during your time in Boston, but when you did your superintendent training classes, did you work with a mentor outside of Boston at all?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5755.534s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5757.234s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Next question is, if you could go to the Board of Education tomorrow and advocate for change, what would you be talking about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5825.741s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So what other measures would you like to use?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5884.281s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=8598.444s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Hi, Dr. Martelone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=8600.345s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I noticed in your resume that there was a year when you went over to the dark side and you worked at the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=8609.348s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Could you tell us what brought you there and what you learned during that year and why you left?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=8881.874s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Could you speak to a time when you had to address parents about a difficult event that took place in a school that you were overseeing or a change that you had to implement that was unpopular where you had to address parents?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=11584.032s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=11585.933s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Sarusa?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1427.574s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm trying to get more, to get to know you a little bit more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1431.356s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1431.836s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I'd like to know what are the core values that define you in your work and how do they affect the way you do your jobs as an administrator and a leader?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2970.757s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm going to pass over the question I planned at the moment just to be able to follow up on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2975.198s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd like you to speak more specifically to your experience in grant writing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2980.439s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is there a grant or grants you could tell us about that you identified and followed up with either, you know, with a group of people but that really you consider to be your success?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=3052.209s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Was that a grant from the DESC?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=3059.777s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: How did you identify that grant?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=3109.531s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=3112.032s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Hi, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=3758.639s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So Dr. Strait, I would like to know what being an educational leader means to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=3764.221s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And have you advocated before the State Board of Education on any issue?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=3769.563s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Or, or and, if you could tomorrow, what would you like to address them on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=3925.442s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And this took place when I was living in- Just FinCom is financial?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=5259.409s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Dr. Strait, when we put together the application, I kept on thinking that we really ought to put one of those warning boxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=5267.255s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And the warning box would say that our current superintendent is available 24-7.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=5271.459s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And he works around the clock, and we can always get him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=5276.022s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And he's been on vacation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=5278.204s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I've talked to him when he's on vacation, which is a rarity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=5282.207s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And frankly, quite honestly, we're just used to that accessibility to our superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=5288.172s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just want to warn you, OK?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=5294.696s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=5296.037s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just want you to understand what our expectation is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=5300.619s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Because quite honestly, no joking aside, that really is quite a difficult place to follow on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=5308.984s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Having said that, I'd like you to know what you do for fun, and what you do in your way, and how you de-stress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=5395.296s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=5399.299s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6495.012s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Dr. Perella, decision-making is a two-edged sword.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6498.695s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Some situations call for decisiveness right at the start while others involved consensus building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6505.24s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Tell us about a situation where you were decisive and how it worked out for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6508.863s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Then tell us about the time when you weren't decisive enough and what you learned from it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6616.55s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So John, why don't you speak to some accomplishment that you've done through collaboration and why you particularly see that as successful?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6674.894s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6675.874s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Russo?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6676.194s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7749.142s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7753.525s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Russo?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7892.89s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: John, what does being an educational leader mean to you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7897.053s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And have you advocated before the State Board of Education on any issue, or if you could, or and if you could, if you could go before them tomorrow, what would you address them on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=8026.06s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=8028.08s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Sebastian.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10009.887s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the things that you've done here, and it's easy to, it really wasn't that long ago, but it feels longer ago, was that you oversaw the reconstruction of the science labs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10020.535s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And as superintendent, there's the educational leadership, there's the budget, there's negotiations, and there's also keeping up with the buildings and grounds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10030.702s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: What was the most challenging aspect of having a major building project in the building?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10036.106s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And what did you learn from the experience?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10224.383s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, John, you gave me a perfect segue because in your answer you mentioned anxiety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10229.565s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And the other question I really wanted to ask you tonight was about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10232.686s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: One of the things that students are presenting with is increasing levels of anxiety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10237.208s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: How do we balance the emotional needs of students while maintaining academic rigor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10243.11s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I wondered if you could give me any, obviously because of confidentiality, I want to be very careful, but could you give me examples of how we can do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1021.821s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Van de Kloof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1023.021s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So, you know, I don't have any problem with having a committee of the whole to discuss the payroll questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1030.005s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I do have a huge problem with the feeling that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1037.329s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: some wrongdoing, the charge of wrongdoing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1040.291s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So let's, just going to be very clear, I'm going to vote for the meeting because I think it's always appropriate for us to ask questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1047.678s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But I'm not, there's, I'm going with an open mind to hear explanations, which I believe will be reasonable explanations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1057.6s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: and have always been in my, when I've gone and asked specific questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1062.723s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But having a committee of the whole is, it's no big deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1065.645s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Why, why not spend yet another night together?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2112.781s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2114.983s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's just great, Jenny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2116.104s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you for all your work and the work, Kathy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2117.845s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2119.006s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That's easy to use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2122.049s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm thinking, of course, just that it just makes things so clear and it's great work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2130.535s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3226.35s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to say that it's not been unusual over the years for the school committee to occasionally comment on something that's coming before the city council and vice versa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3235.092s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The city council also comments on, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3237.526s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: stuff that comes beyond us, so I feel comfortable in supporting the resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3244.051s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I see the library as an essential element in any community, and I particularly want it to be a beautiful library in mine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3250.977s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And we all know that the library needs some updates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3253.679s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's not particularly a surprise or a shock to any of us who have been in it, and we want<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3260.932s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: we would like to see improvements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3264.133s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think in terms of being members of the school committee, it just goes hand in hand with our caring about and dedication to our Medford children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3272.037s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I appreciate the resolution and I certainly will support it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3290.12s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4347.555s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: No, again, I just wanted to add my thanks to Mr. Tucci.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4352.6s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And also just to say that parents came before us at our last meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4358.004s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And it was difficult because we didn't respond to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4360.086s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We didn't say anything about, I think,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4363.135s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: After they left, I said, I just want to say I hear your concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4366.177s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So we really, we did hear their concerns and took appropriate action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4371.781s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4372.401s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm glad the open house went so well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4375.263s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: My colleague, Mr. Russo and the mayor, we were, we were off at the superintendent search committee that evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4382.228s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I didn't get to go, but I'm glad that it went so well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4810.502s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that kind of answers part of my question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4815.045s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: How much is the McGlynn trip this year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4914.768s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4914.948s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Vandiver.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4915.709s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, no, just I think that ultimately taking that step also so that the kids then get to meet each other before they go on to high school, you know, and there will be familiar faces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4925.994s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So clearly that is the progression.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4928.456s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I hope the kids and the chaperones have a wonderful time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4939.984s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We kind of like to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5445.086s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Hands?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5447.098s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5447.238s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Vandekloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5448.159s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I too was surprised to hear how long this training was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5453.801s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: At my workplace, Winchester Hospital, just up the road, Winchester police came in and did run, hide, fight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5463.166s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And those are the three words that you use, run, hide, fight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5466.727s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And it seemed much more targeted and concise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5469.569s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I personally will be speaking with Officer Convino so I understand the differences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5474.371s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And we might also<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5477.325s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know if he's planning on coming to your subcommittee meeting, but if not, perhaps he could come to another one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5485.049s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Anyway, just because we've been using Alice because it's kind of been the original catch word, but I'm not sure that's the only approach, whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5495.695s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm a little puzzled about the time commitment, because it does seem extensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5502.018s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I also wondered whether Officer Covino has, for Rennheide Fight, we have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5506.92s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: there's a movie, which is maybe 15 minutes long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5514.944s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I think if there's a way for the committee to access that video so we can see it too, would be very useful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5521.867s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I will reach out to him myself to ask my questions around it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5526.889s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But maybe if he could be included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6374.329s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Vandekloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6375.429s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, I just wanted to ask if you could recall when the deadline for the Connors scholarship is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6801.315s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that all my questions have been covered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6804.096s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7197.642s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Bob, can I get you to move down just a little?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7201.243s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7201.663s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: A little more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7202.864s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: A little more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7205.605s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7208.686s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: No, that's good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7211.447s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7224.329s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So Erin is down at the zoning meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7230.171s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7232.693s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Hi, Sebastian.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7255.0s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess I didn't read this because I went down to...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7258.383s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: No, they're having a zoning meeting there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7279.0s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Erin is there. There's a concern about Tuft's zoning. I wonder about the other... so me and ...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7297.0s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So we did not know, realize that the top here, we didn't catch that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7304.85s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Nope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7305.671s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I meant to ask you because I remember now after the fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7309.173s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Unfortunately, it's heating through Medford Square right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7312.455s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's hard to, oh golly, well it is close to go home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7335.47s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: When we're here, it's hard to see across.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7337.371s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, you can start without them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7362.987s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: No, they're on the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7364.189s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Erin is attending the meeting, but Anne-Marie are coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7369.576s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, I'd give them a little bit of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7372.3s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It was tough to get through Medford Square because of the, you know, all the cones and the police and...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7393.834s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's December, Bob, it's December.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7414.0s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, so you and I are relics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7420.271s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, she called us relics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7422.413s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I was so mad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7437.0s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Good for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7442.0s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I've never heard of her before this election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7447.0s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Wow, are you serious?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7452.232s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Why don't we just put that out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7453.333s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She might not be in, for all I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7455.275s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know if she's an American citizen or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7458.698s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just know that she just-<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7462.022s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I can't tell you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7462.842s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I've never met her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7464.464s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You and I, because we're old, we're automatically, she called us relics, she called us many things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7476.783s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: What?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7481.526s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She just became like all of a sudden that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7486.0s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That Medford Politics page is just insane.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7540.0s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Really, why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7535.176s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Seriously, Bob?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7550.793s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, you could downsize easily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7553.615s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And your house is probably worth a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7561.0s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Where would you move to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7567.0s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I have to say, that sounds pretty good, but I don't think you should do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7573.291s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, if you want to go, we've got a lot of committee of the whole minute, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7577.458s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7579.2s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Do we have a quorum?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7591.382s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mrs. Cugno is on her way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7594.105s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mrs. DiBenedetto is absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7596.808s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mrs. Kreatz is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7598.71s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You're sorry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7599.13s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7599.771s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7600.051s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7729.901s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If you wanted to summarize it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7731.142s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so this was the Committee of the Whole of November 13th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7734.945s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know, do we need to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7736.987s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Can you hear me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7801.463s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Transcript recorder Miranda Wilson was also in attendance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7805.326s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, the mayor, uh, the, the meeting was called, uh, to discuss school brains, the field trip policy, follow up on student concussions, and report on the North Medford bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7815.654s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It was a very substantial meeting, went on for hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7818.736s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, I just added that Superintendent Johnson made the following remarks the evenings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7824.742s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, and by the way, sorry, it was there was a there was mistake.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7828.446s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It should be Bernadette Riccadeli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7830.768s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Uh, so we addressed the four different issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7834.092s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, and the first item was the report of the North Medford bus capacity and ridership, uh, director of administration and finance Christine Patterson gave the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7842.6s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: report and it's attached.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7844.601s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And Principal Tucci verified the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7848.924s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There are two buses coming from North Medford in the morning and in the afternoon there are between 45 to 50 riders daily which is within its capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7858.27s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: At this time there's no need to add another bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7860.752s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: administration will keep the committee informed as demand increases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7864.695s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The next item was student concussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7867.338s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, we talked about this at length.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7870.46s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, as part of our discussions, parent Tammy Simonotis spoke of her son's experience at Beverly High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7877.066s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She asserted that her son was injured during a JV soccer game and that there was inadequate trainer medical coverage by the Beverly staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7884.732s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She believes that the Beverly schools did not have a certified trainer at the game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7888.296s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Her son suffered a head injury, chipped teeth and nosebleeds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7891.261s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The concern focused upon safety at away games.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7897.478s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Members of our staff spoke with the athletic director at Beverly, but really haven't received any more news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7906.561s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mrs. Simone was pleased with how Medford handles injuries, but was very upset at the Beverly response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7914.783s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Concern was particularly high because the game was allowed to go on after the injury took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7920.885s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The superintendent promised that he will be conferring with the MIA regarding this matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7926.326s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The next item under discussion was the field trip policy and administrators Paul Deliva, Tony Vento and Kathy Medaglio contributed comments during the discussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7937.034s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: CPAC chairperson Melanie McLaughlin raised equity issues about the policy and commented that CPAC should have been consulted as the policy was formulated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7946.622s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There was a discussion about the annual trip to New York by the Andrew School and the questions about deadlines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7956.049s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Among the 90 students who attended, there were 19 students who either had an IEP or 504 plan, and this was 19% of the participants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7968.86s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If we had added another bus, it would have cost approximately $7,500 and would not have made the trip doable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7975.14s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7975.32s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: McLaughlin asserted that the trip excluded students with disabilities and that every trip should be planned to serve all interested students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7983.425s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The issue raised several points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7985.226s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Can field trips be planned with application deadlines if those deadlines are applicable to all students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7990.629s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Should field trips be limited if the economics cannot be balanced?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7994.131s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And should the cost of medical services be shared by all participants or subsidized by the school system?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=7999.634s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: After continued discussion, the policy was tabled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8001.736s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Administrators will bring forward a revised policy that addresses the issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8005.659s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The final issue of the evening was school brains.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8008.321s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Headmaster Perella and Data Information Specialist Registrar Curtis Tudin gave us a report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8015.067s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The headmaster reported that changes had been made to address the GPA concerns raised during the spring by Mr. David Lu.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8021.272s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Tudin provided a chart that showed the increase in usage by parents and teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8025.575s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: More will be done going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8027.237s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This is a work in progress, but it is moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8030.0s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Liu was still skeptical about the accuracy of the reporting system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8033.624s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: He revisited his concerns from last spring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8036.748s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Administrators asserted that the changes would work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8039.211s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The school committee asked to be informed as the year progressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8042.284s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The meeting was adjourned at ten oh five respectfully submitted Paulette Van der Kloot secretary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8175.934s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess that would raise the question to me is if our kids are playing and a student got hurt, why wasn't our student cared for by the trainer who was there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8214.444s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And if the student, I believe the parent, told us that the student was bleeding, so why would the, I mean, we already talked about why didn't the referee stop the game?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8301.613s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8301.893s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But we do have the student who this happened to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8306.194s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And we could have a follow up with the student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9311.131s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I noticed that the Tufts alternative school has a very low participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9315.774s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And this really surprised me because I would think it would almost be the natural environment where kids would be coming in and might pick up some breakfast at school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9322.798s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you have any insight into that number?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9349.277s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And the other thing I noticed is most of the schools we see an increase between September and October.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9358.305s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There was only one school where there was a slight decline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9361.42s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, and I'm just want to make sure that we keep on looking at these numbers because I wouldn't want there to be any stigma attached to, um, kids going in for breakfast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9371.935s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That's why I think the classroom is right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9374.159s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Environment really is ideal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9377.108s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And, you know, sort of if it works at the Columbus, you know, maybe if we could talk to some of the principals and ask another one to try it for a month and see how it goes, just to see what kind of participation we have then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9430.335s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd like to make a motion to suspend the order of business so that we can take up the report on student survey on substance abuse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12099.826s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12100.706s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12102.146s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Honey last spring I was able to attend and I don't remember the title of it but the night of remembrance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12108.908s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: for those who had died of opiate deaths, related deaths.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12114.95s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And one of the things, and it was a very powerful presentation, but there were two speakers that particularly impacted me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12120.631s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: They were both students who had previously attended Medford High.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12125.252s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And one of the things that they said was, they both said they actually were pretty good kids here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12132.114s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, were popular, they were, you know, kids who were not involved, particularly with drugs or alcohol at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12142.965s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And one of my biggest concerns is, I think we're doing good work laying a positive<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12149.432s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: foundation here but I'm totally worried about that transition off topology and um I'm not sure I'm you just mentioned some posters how to help a friend and you know we see these uh incredible stories of you know the frat brothers who you know are drinking too much and then let their frat brother die um you know and that's that's where I'm wondering our last<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12171.654s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We're touching the kids at 10th grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12174.236s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know whether we're discussing at that point, hey, when you get to college, these are things to expect, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12181.52s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm just concerned about that transition to college and loneliness, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12186.322s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: For some kids, when they go off, we put so much, hey, we're going to college, and then all of a sudden they get there, and it's kind of a little lonely sometimes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12215.896s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, also, I just wondered that those two speakers who were there that night, um, have they come and spoken?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12221.438s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I know that they both expressed willingness to me or to others, uh, to come and talk directly to students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12227.58s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I've wondered if, um, I haven't gotten anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12232.822s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm sure you have the names and they certainly expressed their willingness to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12236.323s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I think that we might, um, it might be valuable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12581.312s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that one in our report that one stat about one jewel can have whatever it was contains as much nicotine as a pack of cigarettes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12595.917s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's just so striking that it is time for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12599.438s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We have a graphics arts department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12600.739s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We can get some posters made up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12603.0s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that that would be incredibly valuable to right away get out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12646.823s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12647.483s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Miss Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12648.284s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12648.544s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: No, I just wondered if we can also I don't know whether I should make it as a form of a motion, but maybe we could<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13609.549s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13611.67s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Christina, I had one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13612.991s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Could you please explain what you mean by we are reclassifying payroll codes to reflect correct budget lines?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13660.555s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay so it doesn't mean that somebody who was added to the business office on or transferred in the role was given different classification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14569.929s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14570.57s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14570.75s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14571.951s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So, Mr. Texerra, are we or are you thinking that we would pilot a program in Portuguese for next school year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14598.03s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so um and at Medford High School say for the Portuguese students level one and level two would be those students who were certainly level one would be the students who were just coming to us and level two they might have been with us for Well those levels are based on what we do as a screener test when the students arrive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14640.57s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The other question, which certainly is to be addressed to you, but a little bit different, is that we changed significantly this year when we split some programs between the Roberts and the Brooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14654.166s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: How is that working out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14662.731s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I was just curious, I think one of the concerns had to do with siblings and the ability of siblings to oversee their, you know, sisters and brothers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14683.004s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so at some point I'd like to ask for a report on how that's worked out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15113.592s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Bernadette.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15114.692s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So of the corrections and changes that you've made, I've noted that all the ones that I particularly had brought up, you've taken care of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15122.335s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That, of course, now being said, is my eyes lit on another line here, which I think we need to amend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15131.698s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So if you give me a second to find it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15134.379s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, it has to do with the notification, um, for approval or disapproval of the field trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15140.881s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And it is on page four, uh, section three B. It reads right now, all school sponsored trips which involve overnight travel must receive prior approval of the superintendent and a vote by the Medford school committee six months prior to the trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15157.455s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I have to say, I know that that's totally unrealistic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15160.516s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that when we're thinking about it, we're thinking about all-schools concert trips, which involve overnight out-of-country travel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15168.799s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So that would be when the kids are going off to Spain or Italy or whatever, that that time frame of six months is what we would be expecting or looking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15179.827s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But we all know that there have been other overnight trips, even including, you know, the SkillsUSA program is an overnight trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15190.176s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We've had kids go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15191.157s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The Ethics Bowl was an overnight trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15193.599s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Those things, there was no time to give six months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15196.442s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's not realistic to have our policy say six months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15200.725s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think we need a sentence which say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15205.069s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: for other field trips, you know, for other overnight trips, the school committee will be brought to the school committee for their approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15218.558s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Using discretion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15220.079s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Using as timely, you know, I mean, it depends on the time frame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15226.063s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, prior to the trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15227.584s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But I mean, it has to be reasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15229.145s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We really don't like the last minute ones that I mean, there's a last minute one because there's an opportunity that's last minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15235.109s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And there's a last minute one because nobody got around to telling us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15240.416s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So they have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15270.051s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15270.371s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I didn't hear you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15270.771s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I didn't hear you until after well deadline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15271.972s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There is a clause which allows the superintendent to approve a trip if we don't have a meeting, Okay, so that's covered in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15280.177s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But again, I think the first sentence needs to say overnight out of country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15285.28s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15291.985s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm just trying to think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15293.467s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Other trips involving overnight travel must be must be approved by the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15301.977s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15303.559s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Within an appropriate time frame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15305.161s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we're going to need to leave it a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15310.147s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: unless someone else has a better wording.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15351.132s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Everyone acceptable with that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15352.855s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So you're saying all school sponsored trips which involve overnight travel must receive prior approval of the superintendent and a vote of the Medford school committee prior to payment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15361.551s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Prior to payment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15370.194s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Nope, that's good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15373.218s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15373.938s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15543.35s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you have the samples ready?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15544.832s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is there any concern about tabling this piece of it at this point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15550.178s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is it going to hold anything up in terms of?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15553.322s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We have an amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15554.263s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15571.01s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, Erin, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15573.632s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15574.112s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: No, Erin wants to, what I was just asking was for clarification because Erin wants to table it at right now and hold it until we have all of it together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15582.338s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just asked whether there was any problem with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16047.688s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There's a motion on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16048.629s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16048.809s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16049.51s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So you're going to kill me, but I'm going back to this line about approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16055.855s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And you just said something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16057.357s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You said that what happened in the past is that teachers started, you know, advertising to the kids that they were going to go on this and they got everybody all excited and they might even start raising money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16069.067s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And that has nothing to do with payment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16072.648s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So if we're saying that when we want to approve the trip, if you're waiting, saying, well, we only need to approve it with payment, that means that teacher can already be advertising it and they can be raising money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16086.534s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Payment is not the word that you want there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16133.316s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I didn't suggest payment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16134.197s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Someone else did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16134.757s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16135.418s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: OK?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16135.758s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I suggested that what we were doing was saying that the teacher was going<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16141.343s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think if there's an overnight trip, um, uh, to the school district, I think it's a good idea to have an overnight trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16149.961s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: within the United States that we want two months notice, maybe three months notice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16156.107s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, I'm saying, and then I'm putting in a clause and saying if an opportunity arises for students that is, you know, underneath this timeframe, that approval can be given by the superintendent with notification to the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16173.234s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, that's how I would line it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16175.254s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, because payment, I think is, I think payment is arbitrary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16182.696s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So just recently, the Italian come with this opportunity to go to New York.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16188.618s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16241.817s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We had a new administrator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16252.905s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Let me just ask the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16254.586s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If we're talking about foreign trips out of the country to Italy, to Honduras, wherever it is, how much time does the committee want to know in advance to approve that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16266.434s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: 90 days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16267.115s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Here it said six months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16311.345s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so I think you should do three months because I think Wait, the six months was for foreign travel, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16318.83s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, if you're saying just a general blanket, then and the kids are going to Cape Cod, we're not asking for six months time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16363.137s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16363.617s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=147.249s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So this was the Committee of the Whole of November 13th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=150.472s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know, do we need to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=151.453s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Can you hear me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=153.935s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=154.535s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Hold tight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=158.895s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And present at the meeting were Mayor Burke, Vice Chair Anne Marie Cuno, Arenda Benedetto, Kathy Kreatz, Mia Mastone, Robert Scurry, and myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=166.097s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Also attending was Michael Ruggiero and Paul Rousseau, school committee members elect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=170.398s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Also present were the following, Deputy Superintendent Beverly Nelson, Assistant Superintendent Diane Caldwell, Director of Pupil Services Kathleen Medaglio, Director of Curriculum Bernadette Scurry,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=184.142s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: uh, Director of Finance and Administration, Kirsteen Patterson, Director of Foreign Language, Rita DeCarlo, Supervisor of Health Services, Tony Vento, Assistant Athletic Director, Rachel Curry, um, Headmaster, John Perrella, Principal, Paul DeLeva, Principal Jacob Edwards, Assistant Principal, Nick Tucci, Athletic Trainer, Tanya Cashman, Tim Zitt, Registrar, Curtis Tudin, and other community members, including Tammy Simenotis,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=216.409s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Transcript recorder Miranda Wilson was also in attendance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=220.271s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Um, the mayor, uh, the, the meeting was called, uh, to discuss school brains, the field trip policy, follow up on student concussions, and report on the North Medford bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=230.595s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It was a very substantial meeting, went on for hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=234.216s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just added that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=235.457s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Superintendent Dawson made the following remarks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=238.878s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The evenings, and by the way, sorry, there was a mistake.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=243.379s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It should be Bernadette Riccadeli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=246.32s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So we addressed the four different issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=249.021s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And the first item was the report of the North Medford bus capacity and ridership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=254.003s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Director of administration and finance, Christine Patterson, gave this report, and it's attached.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=261.825s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: uh, Tucci verified the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=263.867s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There are two buses coming from North Medford in the morning, um, and in the afternoon there are between 45 to 50 riders daily with each, which is within its capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=273.196s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: At this time there's no need to add another bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=275.699s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Administration will<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=277.12s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Keep the committee informed as demand increases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=279.643s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The next item was student concussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=282.865s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We talked about this at length.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=286.148s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: As part of our discussions, parent Tammy Simonotis spoke of her son's experience at Beverly High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=291.993s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She asserted that her son was injured during a JV soccer game and that there was inadequate trainer medical coverage by the Beverly staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=299.66s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: She believes that the Beverly Schools did not have a certified trainer at the game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=303.245s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Her son suffered a head injury, chipped teeth, and nosebleeds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=306.249s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Her concern focused upon safety at away games.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=312.429s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Members of our staff spoke with the athletic director at Beverly, but really haven't received any more news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=321.491s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mrs. Simone was pleased with how Medford handles injuries, but was very upset at the Beverly response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=329.733s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Concern was particularly high because the game was allowed to go on after the injury took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=335.814s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The superintendent promised that he will be conferring with the MIAA regarding this matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=341.255s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The next item under discussion was the field trip policy and administrators Paul DeLiva, Tony Vento, and Kathy Medaglio contributed comments during the discussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=351.962s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: CPAC chairperson Melanie McLaughlin raised equity issues about the policy and commented that CPAC should have been consulted as the policy was formulated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=361.568s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There was a discussion about the annual trip to New York by the Andrew School and the questions about deadlines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=371.014s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Among the 90 students who attended, there were 19 students who either had an IEP or 504 plan, and this was 19% of the participants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=383.798s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If we had added another bus, it would have cost approximately $7,500 and would not have made the trip doable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=390.106s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=390.266s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: McLaughlin asserted that the trip excluded students with disabilities and that every trip should be planned to serve all interested students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=398.37s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The issue raised several points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=400.171s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Can field trips be planned with application deadlines if those deadlines are applicable to all students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=405.573s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Should field trips be limited if the economics cannot be balanced?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=409.095s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And should the cost of medical services be shared by all participants or subsidized by the school system?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=414.577s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: After continued discussion, the policy was tabled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=416.779s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Administrators will bring forward a revised policy that addresses the issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=420.623s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The final issue of the evening was school brains.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=423.285s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Headmaster Perrella and Data Information Specialist Registrar Curtis Tudin gave us a report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=430.031s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The headmaster reported that changes had been made to address the GPA concerns raised during the spring by Mr. David Lu.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=436.237s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Tudin provided a chart that showed the increase in usage by parents and teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=440.541s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: More will be done going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=442.202s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This is a work in progress, but it is moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=444.965s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Liu was still skeptical about the accuracy of the reporting system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=448.567s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: He revisited his concerns from last spring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=451.69s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Administrators asserted that the changes would work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=454.172s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The school committee asked to be informed as the year progressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=457.233s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The meeting was adjourned at 10.05.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=459.034s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Respectfully submitted, Paulette Van der Kloot, secretary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=588.741s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Brewer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=590.867s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess that would raise the question to me is if our kids are playing, um, and a student got hurt, why wasn't our, why wasn't our student cared for by the trainer who was there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=602.017s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=629.371s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And if the student, I believe the parent, told us that the student was bleeding, so why would the, I mean, we already talked about why didn't the referee stop the game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=716.57s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=716.85s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But we do have the student who this happened to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=721.313s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=721.493s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And we could have a follow-up with the student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1726.039s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I noticed that the Tufts Alternative School has a very low participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1730.621s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1730.761s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And this really surprised me because I would think it would almost be the natural environment where kids would be coming in and might pick up some breakfast at school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1737.705s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you have any insight into that number?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1767.162s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And the other thing I noticed is most of the schools, we see an increase between September and October.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1773.186s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There was only one school where there was a slight decline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1776.939s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I just want to make sure that we keep on looking at these numbers because I wouldn't want there to be any stigma attached to kids going in for breakfast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1786.849s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That's why I think the classroom environment really is ideal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1792.023s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And, you know, sort of if it works at the Columbus, you know, maybe if we could talk with some of the principals and ask another one to try it for a month and see how it goes, just to see what kind of participation we have then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1845.256s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd like to make a motion to suspend the order of business so that we can take up the report on student survey on substance abuse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4514.619s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4515.499s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4515.639s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4516.96s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Honey, last spring I was able to attend, and I don't remember the title of it, but the Night of Remembrance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4523.703s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: for those who had died of opiate-related deaths.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4529.747s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And one of the things, and it was a very powerful presentation, but there were two speakers that particularly impacted me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4535.41s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: They were both students who had previously attended Medford High.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4540.033s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And one of the things that they said was they both said they actually were pretty good kids here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4546.897s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: you know, were popular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4548.919s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: They were, you know, kids who were not involved, particularly with drugs or alcohol at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4557.745s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And one of my biggest concerns is, I think we're doing good work laying a positive<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4564.21s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: foundation here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4565.491s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But I'm totally worried about that transition off topology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4569.575s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I'm not sure, you just mentioned some posters, how to help a friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4573.719s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And you know, we see these incredible stories of, you know, the Fratt brothers who, you know, are drinking too much and then let their Fratt brother die.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4582.266s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You know, and that's where I'm wondering, our last<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4586.429s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We're touching the kids at 10th grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4589.03s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I don't know whether we're discussing at that point, hey, when you get to college, these are things to expect, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4596.293s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm just concerned about that transition to college and loneliness, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4601.115s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: For some kids, when they go off, we put so much, hey, we're going to college, and then all of a sudden they get there, and it's kind of a little lonely sometimes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4631.012s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Also, I just wondered, those two speakers who were there that night, have they come and spoken?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4636.254s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I know that they both expressed willingness to me or to others to come and talk directly to students, and I've wondered if you might.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4644.677s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I haven't gotten anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4647.618s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm sure you have the names, and they certainly expressed their willingness to me, and I think that we might, it might be valuable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4997.134s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Can I follow up on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4999.234s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Actually, I wondered, I think that one in our report, that one stat about one jewel couldn't have, whatever it was, contains as much nicotine as a pack of cigarettes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5010.677s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's just so striking that it is time for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5014.197s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We have a graphics arts department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5015.498s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We can get some posters made up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5017.758s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that that would be incredibly valuable to right away get out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5061.564s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5062.204s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5062.424s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Vander Kloof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5063.025s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5063.285s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: No, I just wondered if we can also, I don't know whether I should make it as a form of a motion, but maybe we could talk to the Graphic Arts Department and get some posters made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6024.276s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6026.397s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Christina, I had one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6027.738s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Could you please explain what you mean by we are reclassifying payroll codes to reflect correct budget lines?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6075.262s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6075.702s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So it doesn't mean that somebody who was added to the business office or transferred in the role was given different classification?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6983.377s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6985.239s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6985.419s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6986.62s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So, Mr. Teixeira, are you thinking that we would pilot a program in Portuguese for next school year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7012.668s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, and at Medford High School, say for the Portuguese students, level one and level two, would be those students who were, certainly level one would be the students who were just coming to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7023.216s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And level two, they might have been with us for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7055.226s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The other question, which certainly is to be addressed to you but a little bit different, is that we changed significantly this year when we split some programs between the Roberts and the Brooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7068.841s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: How is that working out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7077.409s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, I was just curious, I think one of the concerns had to do with siblings and ability of siblings to receive their, you know, sisters and brothers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7097.546s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, so at some point I'd like to ask for a report on how that's worked out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7528.199s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you, Bernadette.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7529.019s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7529.539s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So of the corrections and changes that you've made, I've noted that all the ones that I particularly had brought up, you've taken care of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7536.942s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That, of course, now being said, is my eyes lit on another line here, which I think we need to amend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7546.305s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So if you give me a second to find it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7547.986s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7549.486s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It has to do with the notification for approval or disapproval of the field trip and it is on page 4, section 3B.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7560.051s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It reads right now, all school sponsored trips which involve overnight travel must receive prior approval of the superintendent and a vote by the Medford School Committee six months prior to the trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7572.062s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I have to say, I know that that's totally unrealistic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7575.125s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think that when we're thinking about it, we're thinking about all-schools concert trips, which involve overnight out-of-country travel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7583.413s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So that would be when the kids are going off to Spain or Italy or whatever, that that time frame of six months is what we would be expecting or looking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7594.434s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But we all know that there have been other overnight trips, even including the SkillsUSA program is an overnight trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7604.764s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We've had kids go to the Ethics Bowl was an overnight trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7608.187s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Those things, there was no time to give six months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7611.049s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's not realistic to have our policy say six months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7615.313s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think we need a sentence which say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7619.677s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: For other field trips, for other overnight trips, the school committee will be brought to the school committee for their approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7633.166s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Using discretion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7634.687s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Using as timely, I mean, it depends on the time frame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7640.651s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, prior to the trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7642.192s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But I mean, it has to be reasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7643.753s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We really don't like the last minute ones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7645.815s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, there's a last minute one because there's an opportunity that's last minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7649.697s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And there's a last minute one because nobody got around to telling us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7684.676s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: until after the deadline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7686.597s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There is a clause which allows the superintendent to approve a trip if we don't have a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7692.86s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7694.8s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But again, I think the first sentence needs to say overnight out of country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7699.903s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7700.243s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Out of country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7701.283s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Travel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7701.944s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And then the second sentence need to say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7706.606s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'm just trying to think, other trips involving overnight travel must be approved by the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7718.163s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: within an appropriate time frame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7719.764s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we're going to need to leave it a little bit unclear, unless someone else has a better wording.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7767.462s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So you're saying all school-sponsored trips which involve overnight travel must receive prior approval of the superintendent and a vote of the Medford school committee prior to payment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7775.812s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Prior to payment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7787.043s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Nope, that's good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7787.844s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7788.565s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7957.242s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: May I ask one question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7957.922s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Do you have the samples ready?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7959.403s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is there any concern about tabling this piece of it at this point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7964.747s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is it going to hold anything up in terms of?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7967.91s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We have an amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7968.851s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7985.602s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Well, Erin, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7988.224s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7988.704s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: No, Erin wants to, what I was just asking was for clarification, because Erin wants to table it at right now and hold it until we have all of it together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7997.25s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just asked whether there was any problem with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8462.295s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: There's a motion on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8463.235s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8463.416s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8464.096s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So you're going to kill me, but I'm going back to this line about approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8470.459s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And you just said something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8471.96s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: You said that what happened in the past is that teachers started advertising to the kids that they were going to go on this, and they got everybody all excited, and they might even start raising money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8483.686s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And that has nothing to do with payment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8487.268s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So, if we're saying that when we want to approve the trip, if you're waiting, saying, well, we only need to approve it with payment, that means that teacher can already be advertising it and they can be raising money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8501.094s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Payment is not the word that you want there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8547.906s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I didn't suggest payment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8548.767s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Someone else did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8549.988s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8550.328s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I suggested that what we were doing was saying that a teacher was going<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8556.352s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: out of the country, the school committee wanted six months notice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8559.657s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think if there's an overnight trip within the United States that we want two months notice, maybe three months notice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8570.498s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, I'm saying, and then I'm putting in a clause and saying if an opportunity arises for students that is, you know, underneath this time frame, that approval can be given by the superintendent with notification to the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8587.845s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I mean, that's how I would line it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8589.886s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Now, because payment I think is, I think payment is arbitrary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8600.651s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: come with this opportunity to go to New York.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8650.589s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Superintendent, do I dare remind you that just last week we were approving a field trip and the kids had already gone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8657.853s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We had a new administrator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8667.498s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Let me just ask the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8669.179s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If we're talking about foreign trips out of the country to Italy, to Honduras, wherever it is, how much time does the committee want to know in advance to approve that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8681.042s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: 90 days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8681.722s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Here it said six months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8683.783s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We usually bring those to you pretty early.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8726.431s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I think you should do three months because I think... Wait, the six months was for foreign travel, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8734.078s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: If you're saying just a general blanket and the kids are going to Cape Cod, we're not asking for six months' time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8781.452s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: All right, Mrs. Chris?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8782.893s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8783.393s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mrs. Stone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8784.993s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8785.113s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Scurry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8785.713s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8786.614s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mrs. Van der Kloot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8787.274s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8787.674s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Burke?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=40.783s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We'll call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=44.186s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mrs. Cunha?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=46.407s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=47.068s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mrs. DiBenedetto?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=48.009s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=48.989s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mrs. Kreatz?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=49.93s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=50.51s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mrs. Mustone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=51.391s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=51.891s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Skerry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=52.632s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=53.132s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mrs. Van der Kloot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=53.853s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=54.253s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Burke?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=277.679s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to mention that as your secretary when I go in and sign the bills I see all of the The lists of teachers who've submitted paperwork to get reimbursed and I get to see what courses they're taking what grades they've gotten they're doing great and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=295.969s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: and so I've noticed there were a lot that came in probably because the teachers took them over the summer in recent and that's the line item you're seeing but I have looked at every single one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=665.64s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, the only thing is of course the some of the kids are already getting to apply to college so there is a timeliness issue and I too have a different recollection than what's here because I remember asking very specifically that whether we could continue for just as a transition period that the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=686.132s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: kids GPAs be listed as they are now as a vocational program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=694.058s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And it says here, Dr. Perrella said that we can create any list you want, so don't worry about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=700.623s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I was definitely surprised when all of a sudden I was told that it wasn't working the way that we expected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=706.067s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=724.442s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I would like to lay the paper on the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1587.026s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to say that I personally was very disheartened when I heard that the teacher's reaction was that he felt that demonized and less so I would felt very very sad because that was certainly I don't think Our intention school committee members or or maybe even the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1606.364s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd the the reality was that we have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1612.625s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: gotten a lot of calls from parents whose kids were not being able to be placed in the school of their choice where their friends were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1623.123s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And this is a real dilemma for us because it has snowballed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1628.726s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I still am receiving emails from one parent who tells me how upset their child is because she has been separated from her friend bank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1640.853s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And for me, this has become this sort of like, how do we solve this issue when all of a sudden one group of parents is selecting a school and that those who weren't able because we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1652.739s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We want to keep class sizes reasonable and it's not appropriate to have one school with, we can't go over contractually the class size limits nor would we want to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1661.903s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So, this issue of friends and how do we, how do we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1668.306s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: tackle this issue so that we don't have an imbalance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1671.909s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I have been to the McGlynn School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1673.59s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think you guys are great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1675.171s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I've had wonderful experiences, wonderful opportunities to be at the McGlynn School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1681.476s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I certainly would be comfortable to send any child of mine to the McGlynn School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1685.379s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And because I have history, as many of us do here, we know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1690.703s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: that there has been sometimes where the balance goes one way and then the balance goes the other way and if I blink my eyes another year it's going to go back the other way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1700.056s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: From a school committee perspective I need to parents to feel<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1706.966s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: good about the choices and this issue of friends, of what happens when my friends go there and it snowballs is real key for me in trying to figure that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1717.252s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That's why we've been talking about saying we want to add after school activities where kids from both schools can attend so that a club will have friends and the kid won't feel so bad about being at the other school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1732.581s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I know from some people, their kids have acclimated in a positive way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1737.305s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Once the parent went, once the kid went, it's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1740.567s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But the angst that we saw and heard this summer was huge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1744.49s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Anyway, thank you so much for coming down and thank you for the work that you do for our kids every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2147.159s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I would say clearly you guys did a great job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2626.4s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2626.74s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2627.54s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2627.62s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2628.521s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just would like to respond to you, Mr. McKillop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2631.161s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we need to keep something in perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2634.482s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Up to this point, up to this year, in the recent years, if you look at our numbers, there's been a very sort of equal distribution between the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2643.364s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The school committee members have been to the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2646.825s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We know many, many of the faces that are before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2649.746s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We've gone to many different events.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2651.926s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We celebrate the McGlynn and we celebrate the Andrews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2655.467s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: we it is wrong to say that we didn't know that with 60% okay that was something which our great speaker talked about tonight but we know that and we may have to look about that is there a perception because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2671.155s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: of that number, that certain parents that are saying, and I think Justin did a fine job alluding to saying, hey, is that being so, parents are saying, oh, well, I want to go to this school instead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2683.925s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Those students are great students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2686.087s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I know them, and I love them, and they're fantastic students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2689.29s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But you know, not everybody necessarily knows them when they're choosing the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2694.655s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I don't really need you to be here tonight to lecture us about what we're not doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2700.567s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We need to keep this into perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2704.093s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We've had a fine working relationship with our wonderful teachers across the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2711.135s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This year, late in the spring, when we had selection, we discovered we had an issue, which caused us to sit back and say, whoa, what's going on here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2721.639s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Because all of a sudden we have these students who are very upset because their friends are going elsewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2727.961s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay, nobody called me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2730.244s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Not one parent called me and said, I don't want to go to the McGlynn because their teachers are no good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2737.873s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Not one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2739.595s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: What I heard was, I want my student to go to the Andrews because that's where his friends are going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2747.648s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's that how do we block up then?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2749.729s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: How do we make this division of friends going groups of friends so that kids don't feel isolated?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2756.234s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That's what is I've heard over and again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2759.676s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That's why I said I was so dismayed when I heard that the teachers felt somehow or another that we were thinking that they were lacking because that wasn't true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2770.003s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I need to keep it in perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2772.827s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I need not to create an issue where there wasn't an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2776.471s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I appreciate the teachers coming forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2779.235s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I need you to remember where this came from and that's the problem we're trying to solve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4259.955s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And now to see the amount of money and the possibilities before us is just wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4264.579s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4265.08s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4267.262s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll go along with the playground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4268.663s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That's a good start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4270.825s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd also like to see a playground like those that they have in England, which are open creative playgrounds for kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4277.511s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I just think that I've been reading up about them, and I just think that kind of a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4282.535s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: the creative space opportunity, which is a decidedly different area than a conventional playground, would be a very interesting thing to pursue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4295.685s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5005.178s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to mention also the Girl Scout Troop who is selling 02155 gear and because they're going to plan, they're planning a trip to Europe and I just really want to support their efforts and it's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5020.507s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I wish I had brought mine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5021.268s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I meant to when I brought it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5022.288s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The bracelet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5024.55s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: No, the hat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5221.114s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We also had a request to discuss inclusionary field trips, and I'm wondering if that could be done in the same evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5823.577s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5825.218s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5825.378s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5826.738s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I wanted to ask, I totaled the numbers, and I see the first year that we were given data for in 2012,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5837.858s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: and then it went to 21, and then it grew to 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5841.28s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So we're going in the wrong direction, but maybe that's a better identification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5845.484s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5847.685s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The second piece of that is what I couldn't tell was whether, let's take fall 2016, there were six football, whether any of those students then were the same ones impacted because the same kids then went and played hockey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5866.767s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess I'd like to trace it too because that's a concern if a kid plays football in the fall and gets a concussion and then plays hockey in the winter and gets a concussion and ends up with lacrosse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5883.243s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's also across the board, not just sport by sport.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5948.669s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I had one other question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5950.85s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I was surprised when I got down to the very last line and found out that one of our students had a concussion as a crew member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6347.504s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Vanderkle, did that happen<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6351.664s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Once, was it a one-time incident, or was it, it was when?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6358.146s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Multiple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6358.667s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It was just the way that they operated, the advisory boards operated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6361.608s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: They did not realize it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6362.308s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: They didn't realize it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6378.874s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But we should be posting it, and now we know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6380.916s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, now we know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6381.656s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3.831s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Scurry will call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=7.476s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mrs. Cugno?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=9.698s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=10.359s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mrs. DiBenedetto?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=11.321s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=12.282s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mrs. Kreatz?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=13.223s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=13.804s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mrs. Mustone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=14.685s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=15.186s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Scurry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=15.926s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=16.427s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mrs. Van der Kloot present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=17.549s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mayor Burke?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=240.954s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just wanted to mention that as your secretary, when I go in and sign the bills, I see all of the lists of teachers who've submitted paperwork to get reimbursed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=253.984s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I get to see what courses they're taking, what grades they've gotten, they're doing great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=259.568s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And so I've noticed there were a lot that came in probably because the teachers took them over the summer in recent and that's the line item you're seeing but I have looked at every single one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=628.936s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Yes, the only thing is of course the the some of the kids are already beginning to apply to college So there is a timeliness issue and I too have a different recollection than what's here because I remember asking very specifically that whether we could continue for just as a transition period that the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=649.375s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: kids GPAs be listed as they are now as a vocational program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=657.78s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It says here, Dr. Perrella said that we can create any list you want, so don't worry about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=663.864s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I was definitely surprised when all of a sudden I was told that it wasn't working the way that we expected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=669.347s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Mr. Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=687.703s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I would like to lay the paper on the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1550.24s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to say that I personally was very disheartened when I heard that the teachers reaction was that he felt that demonized and less so I would felt very very sad because that was certainly I don't think Our intention school committee members or or maybe even the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1569.584s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd the the reality was that we have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1575.868s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: gotten a lot of calls from parents whose kids were not being able to be placed in the school of their choice where their friends were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1586.365s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And this is a real dilemma for us because it has snowballed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1591.968s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I still am receiving emails from one parent who tells me how upset their child is because she has been separated from her friend back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1604.095s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And for me, this has become this sort of like, how do we solve this issue when all of a sudden one group of parents is selecting a school and that those who weren't able because we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1615.982s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We want to keep class sizes reasonable and it's not appropriate to have one school with, we can't go over contractually the class size limits nor would we want to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1625.155s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So this issue of friends and how do we, how do we,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1631.563s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: tackle this issue so that we don't have an imbalance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1635.165s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I have been to the McGlynn School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1636.846s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think you guys are great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1638.426s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I've had wonderful experiences, wonderful opportunities to be at the McGlynn School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1644.67s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I certainly would be comfortable to send any child of mine to the McGlynn School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1648.591s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And because I have history, as many of us do here, we know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1653.894s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: that there has been some times where the balance goes one way and then the balance goes the other way and if I blink my eyes another year it's going to go back the other way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1663.246s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: From a school committee perspective I need to parents to feel<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1670.174s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: good about the choices and this issue of friends, of what happens when my friends go there and it snowballs is real key for me in trying to figure that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1680.441s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That's why we've been talking about saying we want to add after school activities where kids from both schools can attend so that a club will have friends and the kid won't feel so bad about being at the other school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1695.772s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I know from some people, their kids have acclimated in a positive way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1700.495s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Once the parent went, once the kid went, it's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1703.757s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But the angst that we saw and heard this summer was huge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1707.679s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Anyway, thank you so much for coming down, and thank you for the work that you do for our kids every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2110.384s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd say clearly you guys did a great job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2591.719s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just would like to respond to you, Mr. McKillop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2594.361s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I think we need to keep something in perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2597.683s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Up to this point, up to this year, in the recent years, if you look at our numbers, there's been a very sort of equal distribution between the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2607.21s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The school committee members have been to the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2610.032s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We know many, many of the faces that are before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2612.953s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We've gone to many different events.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2615.135s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We celebrate the McGlynn, and we celebrate the Andrews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2619.417s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It is wrong to say that we didn't know that 60%, okay, that was something which our great speaker talked about tonight, but we know that, and we may have to look about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2631.705s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Is there a perception because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2634.366s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: of that number, that certain parents that are saying, and I think Justin did a fine job alluding to saying, hey, is that being so, parents are saying, oh, well, I want to go to this school instead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2647.135s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Those students are great students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2649.296s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I know them, and I love them, and they're fantastic students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2652.478s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But you know, not everybody necessarily knows them when they're choosing the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2657.862s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I don't really need you to be here tonight to lecture us about what we're not doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2663.766s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We need to keep this into perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2667.304s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We've had a fine working relationship with our wonderful teachers across the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2674.325s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: This year, late in the spring, when we had selection, we discovered we had an issue, which caused us to sit back and say, whoa, what's going on here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2684.848s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Because all of a sudden, we have these students who are very upset because their friends are going elsewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2691.149s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2691.91s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Nobody called me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2693.471s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Not one parent called me and said, I don't want to go to the McGlynn because their teachers are no good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2701.079s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Not one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2702.801s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: What I heard was, I want my student to go to the Andrews because that's where his friends are going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2710.856s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And it's that how do we block up then?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2712.937s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: How do we make this division of friends going groups of friends so that kids don't feel isolated?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2719.44s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That's what is I've heard over and again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2722.902s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That's why I said I was so dismayed when I heard that the teachers felt somehow or another that we were thinking that they were lacking because that wasn't true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2732.467s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I just I need to keep it in perspective Okay, I need not to create an issue where there wasn't an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2739.689s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I appreciate the teachers coming forward I need you to remember where this came from and that's the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4209.324s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I remember so many times seeing you gathering signatures to make sure that this would happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4223.061s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And now to see the amount of money and the possibilities before us is just wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4227.685s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4228.185s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4230.367s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'll go along with the playground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4231.748s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: That's a good start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4233.929s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I'd also like to see a playground like those that they have in England, which are open creative playgrounds for kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4240.614s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: And I just think that I've been reading up about them, and I just think that kind of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4245.638s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: the creative space opportunity, which is decidedly different area than a conventional playground would be a very interesting thing to pursue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4258.803s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4968.978s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I just want to mention also the Girl Scout Troop who is selling 02155 gear and because they're going to plan, they are planning a trip to Europe and I just really want to support their efforts and it's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4983.562s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I wish I had brought mine, I meant to when I brought it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4985.342s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The bracelet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4987.603s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: No, the hat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5184.165s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: We also had a request to discuss inclusionary field trips and I'm wondering if that could be done in the same evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5787.083s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Nice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5788.264s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5788.425s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5789.766s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I wanted to ask, I totaled the numbers, and I see the first year that we were given data for in 2012,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5800.888s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: and then it went to 21, and then it grew to 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5804.329s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So we're going in the wrong direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5806.15s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But maybe that's a better identification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5809.071s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's better identification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5810.731s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: The second piece of that is what I couldn't tell was whether, let's take fall 2016, there were six football, whether any of those students then were the same ones impacted because the same kids then went and played hockey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5829.804s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I guess I'd like to trace it too because that's a concern if a kid plays football in the fall and gets a concussion and then plays hockey in the winter and gets a concussion and ends up with lacrosse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5846.295s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It's also across the board, not just sport by sport.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5911.741s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: I had one other question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5913.923s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: So I was surprised when I got down to the very last line and found out that one of our students had a concussion as a crew member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6309.043s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: May I ask a question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6310.083s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Very good, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6310.504s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: VanderKloof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6312.185s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Did that happen,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6314.648s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Once, was it a one time incident?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6317.43s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Or was it, it was when?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6321.132s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: Multiple times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6321.652s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: It was just the way that they operated, the advisory boards operated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6324.594s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: They did not realize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6325.294s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: They didn't realize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6341.903s">[Van der Kloot]</a>: But we should be posting it, and now we know.<br><br>
