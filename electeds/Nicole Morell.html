<h2><a href="../2025-11-24_EjYtsXUKFn4/2025-11-24_EjYtsXUKFn4.html">MCHSBC Full Monthly</a></h2>
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EjYtsXUKFn4&t=3932.28s">And</a> Jenny, I just wanted to ask specifically or explicitly, because I know there's concern about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EjYtsXUKFn4&t=3936.801s">You</a> mentioned a lot of being in the right of way or being out in the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/EjYtsXUKFn4&t=3939.542s">And</a> then obviously, because the property touches the fells, there are markings in the fells now. <a href="https://youtu.be/EjYtsXUKFn4&t=3944.783s">So</a> just making sure that's explicitly said why that's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/EjYtsXUKFn4&t=3947.944s">I</a> know you basically said it, but there are markings that are very close to wetlands and that feel deeper into the woods than I think people think the property goes to. <a href="https://youtu.be/EjYtsXUKFn4&t=3957.427s">So</a> if you could just speak to that a little bit more specifically.<h2><a href="../2024-09-23_XXXXXX00110/2024-09-23_XXXXXX00110.html">Invest In Medford</a></h2>
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=54.04s">Yeah,</a> my name is Nicole Morell she her, I am the chair of invest in Medford, which is the ballot question campaign in favor of questions, six, seven and eight. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=64.65s">I'm</a> also a former city Councilor and mom in Medford, and that covers it.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=125.915s">Yeah,</a> I'll go. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=126.736s">I've</a> been on before, and I gave the same question before, the same answer before, but I'm going to get into specifics. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=132.26s">So</a> we'll go with Chili Garden. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=133.701s">I</a> like the super spicy stuff, but I also like the bamboo shoots and sesame oil. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=139.866s">And</a> they've been extra good lately because my son is a huge fan. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=143.349s">So</a> that's just a win because he's a toddler. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=146.151s">So</a> anything he likes and will eat, it makes it extra good. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=150.295s">Thanks.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=185.911s">Sure</a> I can kick it off and then I'll let other folks join in. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=188.713s">So</a> the Invest in Medford campaign at its most basic is a ballot question committee for people who are in favor <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=194.733s">Of</a> question 678 which pertain to a debt exclusion for the new fire headquarters and to overrides for the schools and our streets and sidewalk. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=202.324s">The</a> campaign is like most local campaigns is made up of your <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=206.871s">your</a> friends, your cousins, your neighbors, people in Medford who are invested in investing in Medford and wanna see these campaign, these ballot questions come to fruition and have Medford be funded in the way that it deserves. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=219.878s">So</a> the ballot measures cover a number of different needs for the city and ask Medford residents if they're in favor of investing in the city in the form of a fixed dollar amount of tax increase to make these things happen. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=232.004s">And</a> I'm happy to go in more detail or if anyone else wants to jump in.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=247.107s">Yeah,</a> so I'll break them down into each question. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=250.329s">So</a> I'm just in sequential order. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=252.111s">So</a> by voting yes on six, voters are approving a debt exclusion, which would increase taxes for residents and commercial to fund the design and construction of a new fire headquarters that would cover the cost of the project as they are outlined today. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=263.879s">Any</a> kind of like small changes for timing of project or slight adjustment would be covered, but we're looking at roughly $30 million. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=273.305s">And</a> what makes it a debt exclusion is this is a tax increase over a set period of time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=277.248s">So</a> once the bill is paid for that project, that amount of tax increase is going to come off everyone's bills. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=283.662s">Seven</a> and eight are overrides, which are permanent, but like the debt exclusion, they're a set amount. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=288.245s">So</a> it's not a percentage increase. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=290.066s">It's</a> a set dollar increase to your yearly tax bill. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=294.728s">They</a> total $7.5 million together. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=297.75s">And</a> question seven helps to stabilize our school district and avoid cuts to our school system, as well as fund a permanent street and sidewalk crew in-house instead of always contracting out. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=308.215s">for</a> the huge amount of work we need down in the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=311.719s">And</a> question eight really helps the schools reach beyond just stabilizing and making sure everything can stay as it is and reach for things that would really benefit our students and our community through a number of different things that are outlined that I can talk about later or let someone else talk about.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=803.917s">Yeah,</a> you can't blame people because if a community says we don't want to invest in this, we don't care about our public schools. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=809.461s">That's,</a> you know, that's really jarring.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1029.096s">Um,</a> so yeah, so part of this is, none of us can see the future. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1032.357s">But</a> I think what that person is getting to is that we have something on the ballot right now that's asking people whether or not they want to invest in our public schools. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1039.959s">And</a> if they say no, that's going to signal to the MSBA that covers part of a new high school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1046.3s">It</a> doesn't cover the entirety of the community has to cover for part of it as well. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1049.681s">And</a> that requires another debt exclusion down the line. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1052.485s">If</a> we're already saying now we don't want to invest in our public schools, they're not going to likely want to go through the process with us to continue towards a new high school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1060.516s">If</a> they think that the next time it comes up to invest in our public schools in the form of new high school, we're going to say no again. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1065.823s">So</a> it's kind of them reading the tea leaves of what we're telling them with this vote. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1070.584s">So</a> it's really important in that sense, too. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1072.585s">And</a> I know there's some confusion, understandably, that people think that what does this vote have to do with the new high school? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1078.166s">It's</a> its own separate vote, but it definitely does have an impact in a different way.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1173.517s">Yeah,</a> I mean, I think it's an essential part of it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1176.159s">I</a> mean, this allows us to bring a crew in-house, allows us to be that much more agile, allows us to have people, you know, in our DPW that this is like the sole focus of their job as opposed to contracting out every single time we need work done, which not only is, of course, a cost, but it's also, you know, a scheduling challenge. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1193.092s">So</a> it's something completely different, allows us to be much more agile and allows us to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1197.676s">chip</a> away on that backlog of street and sidewalk repairs that's been talked about so often. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1203.639s">And</a> I think, yeah, I'll stop there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1208.302s">But</a> it's another equity issue though, too, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1210.343s">Because</a> we're all using the roads, whether we're walking, we're driving, we're biking. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1215.546s">And</a> this is something that asks for a smaller collective investment rather than someone repairing their car every time they hit a pothole or, you know, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1225.253s">Investing</a> in a different mode of transportation because the roads do not allow them to travel in the way they need to travel for their own mobility constraints. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1232.056s">So</a> I think it's, it's all part of a whole of just a collective investment in a city which may be, you know, it's going to be <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1241.533s">$40</a> give or take every month. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1243.194s">But</a> you have to compare to what if you address those issues out of your own pocket through expensive transportation, through tutors, through all of these things that a large amount of people don't have access to, don't have the funds for. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1255.982s">But</a> $40 to get them that is something completely different and something game changing.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1330.094s">Yeah,</a> definitely. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1331.035s">So</a> we got here because of Prop 2.5 that was passed in the early 1980s. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1335.659s">What</a> is the simplest way to explain this? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1340.164s">But</a> it basically limits, a city may increase its total property tax by up to 2.5% of the value of taxable property per year plus an additional amount for new construction, commonly referred to as new growth. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1355.618s">So</a> any increase beyond that must be approved by the majority of voters in the term of an override or a debt exclusion. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1361.942s">So</a> this was passed in the 1980s. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1365.124s">People</a> that were alive then and making financial decisions then can think about, you know, the financial landscape that we were in at the time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1372.589s">Perhaps</a> it was passed with good intentions, who knows. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1375.37s">But</a> basically any time inflation goes up more than two and a half percent, it's essentially, it's going to be a cut to your city budget. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1382.795s">This</a> was definitely a constraining statute that was established, but it was also set up with a tool of an override or a debt exclusion that allows the majority of the voters to say, hey, we want to collect a little bit more taxes because we want these things in our budget. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1397.605s">We</a> want to do more with our budget. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1399.186s">We</a> don't want to have our budget essentially cut little by little every single year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1404.149s">And</a> I think part of how we got here is it's a, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1408.672s">I</a> think it's a fairly well-known fact. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1410.293s">Well,</a> it's a fact that we had the same mayor for a very long time in Medford, and I think it's a fairly well-known fact that he was against bringing an override to the voters. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1419.782s">you</a> have the same mayor for 28 years, that is a long time of little cut, little cut, little cut, little cut. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1425.867s">And</a> we know things like healthcare, healthcare costs that we cover in the city for our employees go up much, much faster than 2.5%. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1433.874s">If</a> we want to pay our workers what they deserve, it's going to be more than 2.5%. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1437.938s">Look</a> at the contracts that are being settled. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1439.599s">If</a> they're getting more than 2.5%, we have to sit and think, where else is that coming from? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1444.783s">So</a> that's kind of how we got here. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1447.205s">I</a> think a lot of cities you'll see that maybe the first time they tried an override, sometimes they pass, a lot of times they pass in the first, sometimes they don't. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1456.833s">Sometimes</a> it's just getting it out into the lexicon and people realizing that this is a thing, this is a tool we have in our toolbox. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1463.498s">We</a> are pushing so that this passes, our first attempt at override passes because it's an absolute need. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1472.016s">If</a> it doesn't, hard decisions will have to be made. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1476.017s">Cuts</a> will come. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1476.658s">It</a> will be not good. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1479.659s">But</a> I know for one, I will try again. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1481.539s">And</a> we will get an override passed, ideally this November.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1489.482s">But</a> I think, you know, it's kind of like the the genies out of the bottle, you know, we've said we are Medford, and we can do an override. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1495.648s">So</a> these conversations are happening, it can be a little uncomfortable for some folks. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1500.132s">But</a> for so long, we wouldn't even say it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1503.235s">And</a> for 28 years for for, you know, for <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1506.118s">40</a> something years since two and a half was passed, that's how we get here. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1509.22s">And</a> that's how it can feel like how, you know, people are saying like, how did we suddenly get here? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1514.163s">It</a> was cut by cut by cut by cut every single year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1517.345s">Um,</a> and then the, the ARPA funding and ESSER funding that came with the pandemic kind of gave us a little bit of a lifeline. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1524.25s">And</a> it also let us see some things that we could have in Medford that are really nice to have in Medford that we really should have in Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1531.755s">And</a> now some of those things and some very basic things need to go away. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1535.753s">unless</a> we find another funding source.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1550.184s">Yeah,</a> absolutely. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1550.964s">And</a> I understand our, I think it's, we're lucky and we're also a little bit cursed about these home values. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1559.006s">So</a> as home values go up, our assessments go up and our taxes go up, but of course our tax rate comes down. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1564.127s">So</a> we're within those prop two and a half limits, but I know we're all in different scenarios for how, what our income is in our homes. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1570.809s">So</a> as far as folks that are affected, just number one, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1575.57s">This</a> is just an investment in the community, and it will absolutely pay dividends in our roads and in our students and in our community as a whole, but for the actual dollars and cents of it, there are a number of programs for seniors on fixed incomes that <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1591.556s">Medford</a> mandates that are not mandates that Medford operates that are really opt in programs to the state. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1597.641s">So</a> we have our work off program where seniors can work, put in some hours for the city to offset their bill. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1604.547s">There</a> are a number of exemptions. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1606.648s">And</a> then there is also the tax deferral program, which allows you to defer the entirety of your real estate bill until you either sell your home or the owner passes away. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1617.835s">And</a> there is, I believe, a 5% interest on that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1620.738s">So</a> the interest does accrue on that and that bill does have to be paid at some point. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1625.161s">But</a> I think understanding that a lot of our longtime residents may have paid a small amount for their home relative to what it's worth now, I think that's an option that may work for some people. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1635.65s">So</a> there are things out there to help folks with real estate taxes in a number of ways. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1640.114s">And</a> those are available on the city website, as well as the Invest in Medford website can tell you more about that.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1696.723s">It's</a> worth noting that that calculator is powered by the Department of Revenue for the state. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1701.306s">So</a> it's not some magical equation we made up, like this is the state that's saying, you know, here's how your tax bill is gonna be affected. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1707.649s">It</a> is based on this fiscal year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1709.11s">So</a> it's, you know, it will change a little bit, but this is our best guess, you know, from the Department of Revenue of how it's gonna impact, what that total bill is gonna look like. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1719.235s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1780.66s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1781.1s">So</a> this will impact our next fiscal year budget. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1783.742s">So</a> if these don't pass the fiscal year in June, July, well, not what goes into effect in July, what's being established by June, that's where the cuts are going to come in if these don't pass. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1794.427s">If</a> they do pass, we can avoid those cuts. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1797.249s">We</a> don't have to have this conversation in June and people will see the impact on their tax bills actually in January 2025. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1802.251s">So</a> very quick turnaround. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1805.513s">Question</a> six actually is a little different. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1808.315s">It</a> won't go into effect right away because that project needs to move on a little bit further is my understanding. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1814.28s">But</a> we do have the calculator just for simplicity. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1816.582s">It</a> includes all three questions. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1818.803s">So</a> that's the total amount. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1819.944s">But</a> seven and eight, if they pass, will go into effect in January 2025. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1824.968s">And</a> question six will be a little bit later, depending on how that project advances.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1946.843s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1947.083s">And</a> to jump on your point, Christine, about the vocational school, too, is one of the ideas I've seen is because there is such an interest in the vocational programming, some of the different offerings have waitlists and making sure every student that's interested in a specific offering can actually get into that class and get into that program. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1963.32s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1973.565s">Yeah,</a> so we are investinmedford.com. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1976.548s">That</a> is great for FAQs, the calculator, just going over the questions that say, here's what it's gonna say on the ballot and here's what this means, because there is specific language you have to use on ballots, which is sometimes not the way we all talk. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1991.58s">And</a> then you can learn how to volunteer or donate or just spread the word. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=1997.045s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1384.306s">Yeah,</a> and I think that helps just keep the number manageable too, because if you're putting down like 30 FAQs, people just check out and can't find what they want anyways. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=1393.152s">Right.</a>

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2517.386s">I</a> think that makes sense because I think my thought was like doing like a roadshow, but to your point, not everything is going to be relevant to everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2525.032s">And</a> we also don't want to exhaust the resources of the volunteers, but you know, in a very long process. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2532.457s">So</a> yeah, I think finding out where, what are different commissions or maybe dial in or be interested in an update and then using folks to, you know, have like a, <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2541.964s">Decided</a> upon presentation or something and having different representatives be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2545.568s">Hopefully.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2546.669s">Hopefully</a> we could do that in a way where it's not like, always, you know, Jenny Graham going to 16 meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2552.194s">But</a> we can have different volunteers from the committee go to different commissions and committees.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2765.593s">Some</a> of them are explicitly outlined in the charter and others are ad hoc. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=2770.356s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3365.363s">Yeah,</a> I mean, I think there's the option of attending community events or just I'm thinking like the farmers market or something doesn't have to obviously be every week, but just let people know this is happening and how they can learn more and get involved.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3448.049s">The</a> clippership lawn. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3449.689s">I</a> can't think either.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3453.351s">Something</a> like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3454.011s">I</a> can't think of it.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3803.171s">I</a> mean, I'm happy to be tagged in as like a support for anything that's like explicitly comms related since that's my wheelhouse among other wheelhouses, but that's what I do during the day.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3818.724s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wosXaL38meE&t=3822.888s">I</a> am happy to help with graphics and like putting slides and presentations together or generating new imagery or anything like that.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3167.712s">Motion</a> by Vice President Bears, seconded by Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3170.854s">All</a> those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3172.095s">All</a> opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3172.635s">Motion</a> passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3176.458s">Going</a> to 23471, offered by Vice President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3179.441s">Be</a> it resolved by the Medford City Council that we commend Councilor Caraviello for his outstanding service on the Medford City Council from 2012 to 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3185.566s">Vice</a> President Bears.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3283.007s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3283.427s">Councilor</a> Scarpellilli.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3950.196s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3950.856s">And</a> if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3951.897s">Councilor</a> Caraviello, I have a tremendous amount of respect for you and what you brought to this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3958.842s">As</a> everyone has said, you absolutely put your money where your mouth is. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3962.805s">I</a> know anytime a constituent has an issue, you're either on the phone or you're down at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3967.728s">I</a> think anytime I've been at City Hall, no matter how many days I'm here, someone's always saying, Rick was just here, you know, fixing whatever issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3975.097s">And</a> you don't hear about it the large majority of the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3978.539s">You're</a> not at the council meeting saying, I did this, this, and this. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3981.721s">You</a> quietly do a lot of things for a lot of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3984.723s">And</a> that makes, that's a really, it's just a really positive thing for the city and for individuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=3991.087s">And</a> as Councilor Scarapelli said, you put it all out there running for mayor, which is just, it takes a tremendous amount of courage and time and dedication to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=4001.914s">No</a> matter who you talk to, regardless of who they were supporting for mayor, there was never a bad thing that could be said about Rick Caraviello, the person. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=4009.217s">You</a> know, whoever politics may lie, everyone could say that you're a tremendous person. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=4015.339s">You</a> leave just a vast amount of knowledge when you leave this body and we're going to be, or they're going to be a little bit poorer for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=4023.421s">But</a> I think to Vice President Bair's point, I know that you're just a short phone call away when they have those questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=4029.964s">So</a> I, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=4031.52s">being</a> the kind of person you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=4032.641s">I</a> think that's just a little bit of comfort knowing we're losing you, but we know where to find you, and you'll give us a little bit of your time once more. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=4039.626s">So</a> I thank you for that, and I know there's folks here who want to speak in the audience, but I know if you want to speak now, we want to wait for everyone to kind of say their piece.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=4123.818s">If</a> folks want to speak, I don't know if Rep Donato, if you want to start, or former Councilor Marks.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=4710.188s">Is</a> there anyone else who would like to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=4714.669s">I'll</a> hand it over to you, Pastor Carmelo.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=4972.459s">Do</a> you want to do it? <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=4973.342s">You</a> do it.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5128.935s">Yes,</a> Councilor Caraviello, you wanna add?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5157.066s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5159.172s">Going</a> to 234, oh sorry, on the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5163.394s">This</a> guy, president. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5164.994s">On</a> the motion of Vice President Bears, seconded by Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5169.536s">All</a> those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5170.297s">All</a> those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5171.597s">Motion</a> passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5173.038s">Going</a> through 23472, offered by Vice President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5176.999s">Be</a> it resolved by the Medford City Council that we commend Councilor Knight for his outstanding service on the Medford City Council from 2014 to 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5182.442s">Vice</a> President Bears.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5323.334s">Thank</a> you, Madam President.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5706.417s">Oh,</a> no, go ahead again.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=5707.797s">There</a> you go.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6032.978s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6033.178s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6033.959s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6034.159s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Knight for briefly sharing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6036.121s">So</a> we'll go to Councilor Tseng.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6154.157s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6235.05s">Councilor</a> Knight, as has been said by most of us, or all of us, you make everyone on this Council better. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6240.931s">No</a> matter the resolution I introduce, no matter how innocuous or how controversial, part of my preparation is trying to get into your head and think as best as I can every legal, procedural, historical argument that you're going to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6255.208s">I'm</a> not sure I've ever gotten all of them, but I think I've started to get close. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6259.15s">And</a> I know that your skill and tenacity demands the same of every single Councilor behind this rail. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6266.132s">As</a> everyone has said, there is no denying how smart you are and how you know your stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6271.314s">And</a> on the off chance that you don't know your stuff, you know how to present it in a way. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6275.556s">that</a> makes the rest of us question if we know our stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6278.339s">So</a> you keep us on our toes, for sure, and that will be missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6283.565s">Your</a> dedication to Medford, to the workers of Medford, to labor, your knowledge and your humor will be greatly missed in this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6290.812s">I'm</a> sad to see you go, but it's been great to have you back, if only for a few meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6296.38s">and</a> remind us kind of what was missing, that little, that salt, that something that was missing that keeps us all awake and engaged. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6304.449s">So</a> I thank you for your service and excited and nervous to see what you do next. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6314.059s">We'll</a> go to former Councilor Marks and then anyone else.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6424.612s">Anyone</a> else would like to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6427.318s">Councilor</a> Knight.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6727.394s">The</a> clock is to count down to the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6733.925s">So</a> on the motion of Vice President Bears, seconded by Councilor Collins, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6739.547s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6740.287s">All</a> those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6743.148s">Motion</a> passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6744.329s">23473,</a> offered by Vice President Bears, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we commend President Morell for her outstanding service on the Medford City Council from 2020 to 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6754.352s">Vice</a> President Fares.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6766.257s">I</a> said that.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6954.599s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6955.119s">This</a> is a funny position to like calling people to say nice things. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=6959.403s">Councilor</a> Collins.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7171.175s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7172.195s">Councilor</a> Caraviello.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7251.85s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7257.6s">save</a> it out for last.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7475.186s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7477.688s">Councilor</a> Sen.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7706.825s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7708.846s">Councilor</a> Knight.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7911.933s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=7914.935s">Former</a> Councilor Marks.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8003.628s">I'm</a> keeping everyone engaged.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8075.131s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8076.052s">I</a> really appreciate you coming up and saying some kind words and some true words. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8080.035s">And</a> hopefully now that we're both out of office, I won't get so nervous every time I see you either sitting there or approaching the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8087.82s">So</a> one last time, I appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8091.323s">I</a> want to thank everyone for their kind words. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8094.679s">I</a> truly love this job and there are times that I think I'm not half bad at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8098.24s">There</a> are times I think I'm terrible at it and there are times I think I'm great, but they all even out in the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8102.922s">So</a> deciding not to run this year was one of the hardest decisions I've probably ever had to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8109.604s">I</a> think as comes through on the council is I usually <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8112.526s">know</a> exactly how I feel about something. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8114.047s">I'm</a> always listening, but I usually know how I feel. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8115.767s">I</a> know how I'm going to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8116.668s">And</a> this is something that I really wrestled with for months and probably, honestly, the better part of two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8124.631s">But</a> like everyone in these seats, I also have a full time job. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8129.082s">and</a> I have a favorite constituent who is just about two years old and who has shared his whole life with this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8142.125s">So</a> I'm stepping away to spend more time with him in those early precious years, which I know you all know, but I think, again, without the lack of paper and all these things, sometimes that's information that hasn't been shared. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8153.669s">I</a> care about this job. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8154.889s">I</a> love this job. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8156.61s">I</a> care about my son. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8157.29s">I</a> love my son. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8157.85s">I</a> want to spend some time with him. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8158.931s">You</a> know, there's a saying in parenting that the days are long, but the years are short, which I know all the parents here will agree with. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8166.694s">And</a> I think I'd like to extend that to city council where the meetings are long, but the years are short. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8174.436s">I</a> can't believe it's been four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8175.557s">I</a> can't believe it's only been four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8177.637s">I</a> can't believe it's been a long four years and it's been a short four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8182.599s">I</a> think starting this whole journey just before the pandemic I know we all have that feeling of time kind of collapsing in on itself and it feels like so long ago I started in this body, but it's only been just a few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8196.385s">We</a> did a lot of great work as a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8199.146s">There's</a> a lot of great work left to be done, a lot of work left to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8202.127s">I'm</a> not going to go through everything we worked on because this isn't a campaign speech, but there's a lot that I'm proud of. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8208.73s">And</a> I just want to note that <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8211.411s">We</a> often say that it's a privilege to do this job. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8214.513s">It's</a> a privilege to represent your peers. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8216.295s">It's</a> a privilege to serve the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8217.976s">And</a> beyond that, it's also an extreme privilege to have the opportunity to meet and strike up conversations with and friendships with people that simply wouldn't happen if you didn't have the access and the welcome that this role gives you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8234.221s">And</a> so I think every person that I've spoken with for that, whether we agreed or not, the ability to sit down with someone or pick up a phone call and have a conversation with something has been a privilege and really a gift. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8246.518s">And</a> another gift, which, you know, there are nights <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8250.819s">I</a> can't believe I'm saying this, but it's all of you behind the rails. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8255.926s">I</a> think there's something going on in this body since, you know, I think the past two years in particular that there's a camaraderie and a respect that I think we all know is <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8266.161s">quickly</a> or has already left much of politics, but I think it's still alive and well behind the rail where, as has been said, we all don't agree a lot of times. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8276.009s">It</a> gets heated sometimes, but I think at the end of the day we know there's a deep respect. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8281.194s">There's</a> usually, you know, after some of our, even during some of our most challenging meetings, <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8286.698s">there's</a> a time where we can have a few jokes and let out some of that tension and remember that we all respect each other and no one here holds a grudge. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8296.865s">I</a> want to say very briefly about people going around the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8299.326s">I've</a> already said my nice things about Rick and Adam, but Justin, it's been a pleasure to serve with you and just to have your cerebral and considerate approach to everything and also have a resident Harvard man. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8312.535s">Kit,</a> you are the epitome of speak softly and carry a big stick. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8315.677s">And</a> I think everyone learned that one or two budgets ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8320.079s">And</a> it's just been so good for my soul to have another woman on the council that I can kind of just look at sometimes or catch a smile from in those heavy meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8333.203s">George,</a> I think it may have taken us a longer path than some to get to that place of friendship, but we got there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8338.488s">And</a> I truly respect you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8339.99s">And</a> I just, we've been able to have some conversations this term in particular, just to say, Hey, you know, I don't agree with you on this, but I want you to know it's no hard feelings. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8348.198s">And</a> I know you're doing what you think you believe is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8351.282s">And</a> I think that's a, it's a two way street and I really respect you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8355.025s">And</a> vice president Bears, when I was first running and working really hard, someone pulled papers on the very last day and I thought, who is this Zach Bears? <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8368.035s">Why</a> is he trying to ruin me? <a href="https://youtu.be/PxdgL7RGrJQ&t=8373.038s">And</a> the answer over to that, who is this Zach Bears, is he's a friend, he's a confidant, he's someone who, when I had a one week old, a one month old, a one year old, allowed me to be in this position as president, who helped me with some of the logistics and all those things that go on behind the scene and allowed me to serve and fulfill this role and chair the body as I was home with a little tiny

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1202.241s">I</a> have a motion from Vice President Bears to approve for first reading, seconded by Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1206.083s">Mr.</a> Clerk, please call the roll.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1226.49s">Yes,</a> I'm in the affirmative, you're in the negative, the motion passes for first reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1232.754s">23467,</a> I believe that's my paper, so I will go in first to the chair, so vice president Bears.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1506.065s">Thank</a> you, Vice President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1507.086s">So</a> first, I'd like to amend my letter if I could, Mr. Clerk, for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1511.127s">My</a> language was not clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1513.028s">Though</a> the school committee has largely been women for the better part of a decade, it was more evenly split before that. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1518.49s">However,</a> my statement stands about the makeup of the city council and how hard it is for women to break in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1523.471s">Only</a> a small number of women have ever served on the city council in Medford's history, with two more joining in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1529.338s">I</a> would have meant to strike both references from the whereas if I could, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1534.58s">Historically,</a> the school committee has been the only elected body where women could serve while city council remains majority men to this day. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1541.063s">Going</a> back more than a hundred years ago, there've been multiple women on school committee in Medford, whereas the city council has been almost exclusively men until more recent history. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1549.446s">Historically,</a> school committees have been paid less and valued less than that of city council statewide, countrywide as an accepted fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1556.812s">One</a> reason I brought forth this resolution is to interrogate that fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1560.275s">School</a> committee has many statutory powers outlined at the state level. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1563.538s">They</a> play an essential role in the city, a role that's getting more involved and more complicated in the current political climate. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1569.423s">And</a> like many city Councilors, they're on call essentially 24 seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1573.186s">But</a> yet this body has always been seen and continues to be seen as less than. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1577.71s">One</a> reason to me comes from a conversation I've had many times with my mother, a 35 year public school teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1585.069s">is</a> that the school committee is an extension of the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1587.75s">Schools</a> and teaching are seen as women's work, largely because it's one of the few ways women could gain employment. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1593.512s">In</a> a country where we undervalue or often do not value women's work, be it caregiving roles, aides, paras, teachers, social workers, nurses, and the like, regardless of who is serving in these roles, men or women, we do not value them in the way that we should. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1607.697s">This</a> is not to equate any of these positions as they are very different. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1610.938s">I</a> absolutely understand that and believe that. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1613.305s">But</a> it is to note that when we undervalue work for a long time, changing the financials and the mindset around it becomes hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1620.03s">Simply</a> reaching for equity of pay seems like an overreach. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1624.653s">Equity</a> of opportunity is another important reason I brought this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1628.396s">This</a> resolution is about who's not in the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1631.078s">I've</a> been to many trainings and brainstorms where folks struggle with how to bring diversity of experiences and voices to the table in many, many spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1638.504s">Diversity,</a> which has been proven to make boards and organizations more successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1642.386s">It's</a> something we struggle with here, but it's not unique to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1645.969s">The</a> one answer that always comes back in these brainstorms and these thought projects is paying folks for their time. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1652.854s">I've</a> spoken with many folks in Medford who want to be more involved, but it doesn't make financial sense for them to get a babysitter to attend a school committee meeting, let alone commit to multiple years of pay that barely covers the cost of childcare or loss of learnings they would need to cover regular meetings, negotiating meetings, grievances, executive sessions, and the day-to-day essential role of responding to residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1671.957s">By</a> saying we don't value this position, we say we don't value the insight, experiences, and representation of folks who do not have the financial support and caregiver support that is needed to give to these roles. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1681.702s">This</a> excludes folks doing shift work, folks who need two jobs to get by, people without free or low cost childcare. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1688.326s">No</a> one does these jobs, these elected jobs for the pay, but the lack of it certainly keeps many folks from seeking them and having a representative body. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1697.674s">I've</a> been having these conversations long before I even ran for council, so I wanted to bring this forward before the end of my term. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1703.706s">This</a> equity discussion is important to me, and equity delayed is equity denied. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1708.134s">However,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1709.184s">I</a> absolutely do hear you, and I really want to thank the folks who have reached out to me on email over the past few days. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1713.826s">I</a> appreciate those just willing to hear what I have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1718.029s">I</a> understand your feelings, absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1720.15s">And</a> I know there are many folks eager to talk tonight, and I'm eager to hear from you. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1724.212s">So</a> reflecting on this, I would further amend this paper that I would hope for a phase-in over time to either these amounts or amounts that reflect similar cost of living increases to the council or other city employees over the past 24 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1738.991s">nearly</a> two and a half decades where there were no such adjustments for the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1743.215s">Also</a> understanding it's the end of my term, as I did not seek reelection to spend more time with my almost two year old, a testament to the trade offs of these types of jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1750.922s">My</a> motion is to send this to the committee the whole so that the incoming council may consider it if they so choose and explore what they would like based on the conversations we have here tonight and ongoing conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1762.588s">So</a> I thank you for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1763.449s">I</a> thank you for your respect as I share this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1765.831s">I</a> know it's a topic that people feel very, very strongly about, and I absolutely understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1771.036s">And</a> I thank you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=4041.255s">Point</a> of information, it's the way Zoom works, there's like a lot of sound, it cuts out.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=6125.581s">I</a> just have a brief point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=6126.861s">I</a> just want to note that no money has been moved anywhere just at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=6130.502s">No</a> vote has been taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=6131.363s">I</a> just want to make sure that's clear, because I understand the intent of what you said. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=6135.664s">I</a> just want to make sure that's clear, because that happened.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=6955.948s">I</a> do just want to thank Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=6956.749s">Douglas</a> for bringing that forward about the PFMLA. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=6958.93s">I</a> wasn't aware of that fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=6960.611s">Vice</a> President Bears and I actually introduced a resolution <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=6963.823s">two</a> years ago about extending PFMLA to the entire city. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=6968.327s">And</a> we were essentially rebuffed by the administration about it being a possibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=6972.53s">So</a> it's really helpful for me to know that that is continuing on. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=6976.894s">It's</a> something that still is on our books. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=6978.375s">It's</a> nothing that's been disposed of. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=6979.716s">So</a> I hope that the next council will continue the conversation around it.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=6988.306s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=6988.647s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=10039.058s">So,</a> I believe we are back from recess. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=10042.5s">I</a> know I motion to revert to regular business. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=10044.361s">Someone</a> would like to revert? <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=10046.462s">We</a> have someone from public participation that I thought had left and he has been here the entire time and I feel like we should take him.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=21.885s">Present.</a> Five present, two absent. The meeting is called to order there will be a meeting of the Medford City Council committee of the whole on Wednesday, December 6 2023 at 6pm in the Medford City Council chamber on the second for City Hall and via zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=36.752s">The</a> purpose of this meeting is to discuss an RFP for updating the Medford zoning ordinance paper 22-533. <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=42.394s">The</a> committee has invited Alicia hunt director of the office of planning development sustainability to attend this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=47.496s">For</a> further information, aids and accommodations, contact the City Clerk at 781-393-2425, Sincerely yours, Nicole Morell, Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=55.304s">So</a> what brings us here tonight is after completing... <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=58.806s">the</a> recodification work that we had engaged with Attorney Bobrowski over two years to do that work that was completed actually last March. <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=67.63s">We</a> requested more funding from the mayor's office to get to the next phase of zoning, which we had worded as reflecting the adopted comprehensive plan to work through the zoning changes that would be needed to reflect the comprehensive plan, as well as some minor adjustments to the recodification that have passed now that they're actually in force. <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=85.759s">I</a> think maybe a few <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=87.318s">just</a> small changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=89.3s">So</a> this request for proposals actually went out in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=92.142s">We</a> did not receive any proposals back. <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=94.625s">The</a> thought was purely timing. <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=97.007s">We</a> believe it was time to be back right around the 4th of July holiday, close of the fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=102.211s">So</a> we actually put it out again. <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=103.713s">Again,</a> this is with the help of procurement with Fiona and also with Director Hunt. <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=109.037s">This</a> was put out again in October. <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=111.421s">We</a> did get two proposals that were delivered to the council, shared with the council on November 21st. <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=116.686s">We've</a> had ample time to review. <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=117.827s">And</a> based on discussion tonight, what the next steps are are to score the two proposals we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=124.452s">We</a> have a little, all the Councilors have a little scoring sheet, and then that way we're able to pick out of the two who our first is, and then once we choose our first priority selection, then we can actually get the <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=137.083s">costs</a> data released and then there might be additional steps as far as negotiating costs, any additional questions like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=143.765s">So</a> really we have Director Hunt here to provide any kind of background she can as far as either process or her insight into the proposals that we've received and really just opening it up for any feedback from Councilors or any additional questions that we might be able to relay to the two applicants that have provided proposals that are before us tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=165.032s">So</a> I will <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=167.202s">Open</a> it up, if Councilors have any thoughts as far as the two proposals before us, or any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=176.951s">Vice-President</a> Bears.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=918.744s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=920.472s">Are</a> there questions or comments from Councilors? <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=923.896s">I</a> think to the point about the scoring sheet and having to follow up with references, I'm happy to take that on or Vice President Bears, if you want to split that, we'll each take one and we can call for references.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=945.916s">I</a> mean, I think, yeah, and I think we've heard from Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=948.597s">I</a> think we could definitely fill in, you know, 1A and, yeah, I think it's just 1A and B based on our conversation tonight, and then C would just be based on the references. <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=958.779s">I</a> think we're happy to, I would have to, I'm like, I don't know if that counts as deliberation if we sent the reference sheets around.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=1029.426s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=1029.726s">Yeah,</a> I haven't spoken, but I agree with everything that's been said. <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=1032.569s">And</a> I appreciate you, Director Hunt, for really kind of naming the players and the different roles that they play with the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=1037.914s">And</a> I do appreciate that Fisher Associates has had some work in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=1040.776s">So</a> I think if for whatever reason we couldn't get what seems to be our first choice, that's very helpful to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=1046.6s">But</a> I think knowing that we had, you know, Attorney Bobrowski, who's a partner in this, for recodification. <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=1051.041s">We</a> had Emily Innes, as far as the comprehensive plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=1053.962s">We</a> had her on a meeting just last week to help us understand the MBTA Communities Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=1058.864s">And</a> then Attorney Silverstein, who I know we've worked with a number of projects recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=1063.025s">And</a> then I think he also just, I can't remember what we worked with him on the council, but I know in his previous role at KB Law, we worked with him a bunch. <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=1068.847s">I</a> want to say it was over 5G or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=1071.488s">We've</a> had many, <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=1073.215s">You</a> know, I think we've all had great working relationships with him as well in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=1078.2s">So</a> I think seeing that combination of folks as well as a number of folks who we haven't worked with yet, but also seem to have great qualifications, I think it's very exciting for me.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=1269.314s">And</a> maybe reflecting the will of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=1271.735s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bxdTkh9HwuM&t=1313.75s">And</a> yeah, well, and somewhere they're reflecting the will of the council.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=182.076s">Thank</a> you, Vice President Paris. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=183.576s">Attorney</a> Stein, Attorney Everett, is that something you would be able to provide?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=502.902s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=504.322s">One</a> question I had I actually got from a resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=506.083s">So</a> you talked about, I think, the ability of <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=509.275s">all</a> I think you said, it has to be every abutter on a private way has to agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=512.656s">Could</a> residents on a private way, I'm not an abutter, but residents, could residents on a private way, if everyone on the street agreed, could they put like a speed hump on their road? <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=522.639s">Or</a> does that exist in some other plane of regulation?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=533.802s">Sorry,</a> can you hear me now? <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=537.783s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=545.205s">No,</a> they can't hear us, Kevin. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=548.906s">It's</a> just faint. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=550.426s">Can</a> you hear me now?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=553.127s">OK,</a> so could I had a question from a resident that asked if they got everyone on their private way to agree, could they actually install a speed hump on their private way or does that exist under some other regulation?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=653.075s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=653.475s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=653.836s">And</a> not that anyone is asking this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=655.177s">So</a> just making sure I'm understanding that kind of the way that, you know, every level up from the city is what Trump's like MGL, Trump, you know, you follow MGL and then city law and federal kind of that thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=666.066s">We</a> can't, people couldn't suddenly say, we want our private way to have a 55 mile per hour speed limit. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=671.25s">And</a> that, you know, just making sure that the city regulations apply first. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=674.913s">And</a> then if folks want to work within that city regulation to make some changes to their street, they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=683.376s">or</a> city ordinances apply first? <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=696.219s">I'm</a> just saying, so I guess another way to phrase it is like, we can't make an ordinance in Medford that supersedes or goes, supersedes MGL. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=704.061s">And</a> MGL can't make a, you know, the state house can't pass a law that supersedes federal law. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=708.583s">So</a> I'm just saying that the- <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=711.164s">Yeah,</a> so private way folks can't make some law that is outside of or some regulation that is outside of city ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=719.249s">All</a> city ordinances still apply.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=724.893s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=726.774s">So</a> I think actually a lot of the questions we get are related to services. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=731.437s">So</a> I think regulation, I think that makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=734.979s">I</a> think where folks get confused, understandably so, is <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=739.087s">you</a> know, they're told they have a, they know they live on a private way and outside of the fact that we all pay the same taxes regardless of what type of street we live on, they get some city services. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=749.613s">So</a> the street may be plowed or there may be, you know, if sometimes when branches fall into the road, like large branches, they may be picked up, things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=758.378s">If</a> folks request a stop sign, it gets installed. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=761.54s">So</a> where's the line there as far as services that cities with private ways <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=768.243s">can</a> or do provide and then ones that would be going outside and would be deemed using public funds for private goods?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=824.099s">Okay,</a> and could you, you were hard to hear a little bit before, could you repeat back the section of MGL that was adopted, opted into for that?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=872.022s">So</a> an example for that, I have a very specific example, is that on a private way, it just has a catchment basin that, because of increased rain events, it's just overflowing. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=884.383s">there</a> wouldn't be really anything that the city could do to fix that, because that needs a complete overhaul. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=888.866s">It</a> needs to be likely tied into the city sewer to avoid that problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=892.308s">And</a> that would not be considered a temporary repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=894.229s">That</a> would be a permanent.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=897.991s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=900.052s">I'm</a> going to go to Commissioner Gabert.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=984.957s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=986.478s">I</a> believe Councilor Scarpelli is on the call now. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=989.761s">Councilor</a> Scarpelli, I know you had requested this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=992.062s">If</a> you have specific questions that you wanted to ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1004.691s">I'll</a> give her a beat, assuming that's him. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1010.115s">One</a> question, again, a specific instance that we've had <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1015.242s">A</a> lot of, I live on a private way, I have no idea why it's a private way or where the papers are, you know, I don't get anything like, I did not get anything like that when I, you know, I bought my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1024.348s">But</a> folks have said, folks who have been in their home for a really long time, we had a specific example of someone saying that the city donated a tree, they planted a tree in front of my house on a private way before I was the owner of the house, I didn't ask for this tree, and now it's damaging the sidewalk in front of the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1039.999s">So</a> since the city planted the tree, isn't this the city's responsibility? <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1044.795s">So</a> what is the legal opinion on something like that? <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1048.898s">It</a> happens a few. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1051.339s">It's</a> happened more than once.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1117.122s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1118.964s">I'll</a> go to Councilor Caraviello.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1186.695s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1188.276s">Um,</a> attorney ever signed in your opinion, I mean, should there be <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1193.021s">I</a> know we just got a few new street trees planted on my private way. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1198.368s">Big</a> fan. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1198.908s">But</a> I mean, in your opinion, should there be something that folks are given notice or something now that this tree is on their private way? <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1208.379s">it</a> becomes their responsibility.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1233.5s">I</a> guess that as a question to Attorney Everett or Stein, is that something that would <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1238.322s">behoove</a> the city to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1239.227s">And</a> Commissioner Ray, I don't know if you have anything to add. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1243.086s">You</a> know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1244.626s">Oh,</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1245.027s">I'll</a> just go to Commissioner McGibbon just from the DP. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1247.007s">Sorry.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1283.198s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1284.218s">I'll</a> go back to you, Attorney Everett.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1475.223s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1479.044s">Any</a> other questions from councillors at this time? <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1480.885s">I</a> did see Councilor Favelli is unfortunately unable to join us, but I do think we're <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1485.285s">covering</a> the bulk of the kind of the recurring questions we do get. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1489.72s">Another</a> question, oh, go to Councilor Caraviello.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1540.938s">Thank</a> you for sure, Gabriel.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1598.586s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1601.088s">Vice</a> President Bears.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1848.913s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1849.794s">Commissioner</a> Gibran, in that same thought, <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1854.593s">This</a> might be a city engineer question, but I guess it's kind of all the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1857.677s">Has</a> the city identified any streets that they would want to convert to public ways, or is it the position of the city that they're only looking at resident-driven desire to convert, understanding it's costly and involved?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1963.901s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1964.401s">And</a> just to kind of go a little bit down that path, again, not that there's any specific plans, but thinking, again, I live in a private way, so <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1973.061s">Sometimes</a> I'd assume that to make those betterments, like we have a very narrow sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1976.604s">I</a> would think the sidewalk would have to be up to ADA standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=1979.127s">And</a> would that be, it would involve some, you know, some taking of like front lawns or, or widening the road or things like that.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2021.777s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vbOyOtHL1y8&t=2022.917s">Councilor</a> Caraviello, did you have another question or is your hand still up?

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1634.314s">So</a> it's not, yeah, so it's not necessarily excluded in that nothing can ever be built there. <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1639.315s">It's</a> excluded. <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1640.096s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1640.596s">Is</a> there somewhere that we can see, because excluded, this is like a term that was defined within the act. <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1647.258s">It's</a> not like a previously used term, correct?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1696.416s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1697.397s">Danielle,</a> did you have something you wanted to add? <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1698.797s">Do</a> you need to be unmuted?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1711.785s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1743.677s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1744.017s">Yeah,</a> that's really helpful to know because I think there's been some chatter on Wellington being kind of a neglected part of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1749.939s">And</a> of course, here's a big change. <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1751.84s">They</a> just chose Wellington because no one cares about Wellington. <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1755.621s">So</a> I think that's helpful information. <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1759.042s">And</a> then just one quick question for maybe ends up being longer just Alicia and Danielle and then I'll make sure to go to other Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1766.07s">I</a> think one thing that's been said as this has been presented to kind of help assuage just that this is a big change is that this of course this is a zoning change this does not mandate, the building of any of these units. <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1779.724s">But</a> of course, we make this zoning change then it is open, you know, it's open for anyone to present a development and because it is on this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1789.149s">There</a> is little space for. <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1791.19s">I</a> don't want to say refusal but I mean people can develop these things, stuff by right that's that's how it's designed right so I just want to. <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1799.614s">make</a> clear on that because I think we go we say this is just zoning it doesn't mean units but in a place like Medford and this is how it's designed because we're zoning there's very likely development to follow.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1877.863s">I</a> appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1879.884s">Go</a> to Councilor Caraviello.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=1913.167s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Tseng.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2167.565s">Thank</a> you both. <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2168.786s">Any</a> other questions from councilors? <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2172.765s">I</a> do have one more question. <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2174.447s">Director</a> Hunt, I know you've explained this to us before, but just help me. <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2178.252s">I</a> promise I'm not being obtuse, but I know when we talk about the number of units in an area like Wellington, some of those units already exist, or what is that? <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2188.445s">Like</a> some of those units are already factored into the calculation. <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2190.908s">Could</a> you explain that again?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2333.076s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2333.636s">Yeah,</a> that's really helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2334.376s">I</a> think that's what I was circling on without the words to ask it, so I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2339.199s">Vice</a> President Bears.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2363.508s">Yeah,</a> and I think that's, you know, my interpret or I received part of that is like, this is what happens when you write an act for such very different communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2373.057s">And</a> we're already Yeah, we're already pretty built up in many spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2377.922s">So</a> any further questions from Councilors? <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2383.247s">Or</a> any members of the public who have questions or would like to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2392.642s">All</a> right, seeing none, Alicia, Emily, Danielle, is there anything final you'd like to say as we're here tonight, knowing we're of course going to meet on this a few more times?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2625.827s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2691.73s">Thank</a> you, Vice President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2693.992s">Any</a> further questions or do I have a motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2701.769s">Seeing</a> no further questions, do I have a motion to receive and place on file?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2709.995s">Great,</a> so I have a motion from Vice President Bears to adjourn, seconded by- Seconded. <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2714.658s">Councilor</a> Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/_r--u5JPvtQ&t=2715.698s">Mr.</a> Clerk, please call the roll.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=523.46s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=523.701s">We'll</a> go by some bears.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=612.97s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=776.167s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=778.348s">I</a> think, yeah, just to build on, I don't see any councilors talking at the moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=782.048s">To</a> build on what Vice Mayor Bears and Councilor Scarpelli said, yeah, I think our intent was very much to just take the policy that was in place, make sure it's streamlined, and make sure it's very explicit in an ordinance, the steps that need to be gone through. <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=794.031s">and</a> of course deferring to the Board of Health for those approvals because as Councilor Scarpelli said, sometimes these come before us, they might come before us late, someone might realize they need it for an event on Wednesday, we don't need it again until the next week, so I think it's just taking this and moving it to the Board of Health which already sees these permits and just making them the deciding authority on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=813.027s">So</a> I don't think, or I know, based on past conversations, we weren't looking to go into <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=818.451s">zoning</a> and all this stuff and multi-day permits, I think, by design. <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=823.392s">We</a> really wanted to focus on special permits at this time because that's what we felt comfortable about. <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=826.893s">We</a> added the provision as far as how far away from a brick and mortar. <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=831.934s">These</a> food trucks need to be parked and things like that, but it really was to simplify it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=836.175s">And</a> Attorney Stein, some of what you said, I absolutely understand where you're coming from, but some of what you said sounds like this is just making it a little bit more involved than was our original intent. <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=848.2s">So</a> I can kick it back to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=849.741s">I</a> don't see any other councilors who want to speak at this time if you're able to respond to that.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1234.519s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1235.679s">Councilor</a> Caraviello.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1275.268s">speak</a> to that as far as others.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1306.594s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1307.095s">Vice</a> President Paris.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=1990.484s">I</a> think that'll get you there.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2049.819s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2050.099s">And</a> I'm gonna go to Director O'Connor, set her hand up.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2057.926s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2064.148s">Oops,</a> sorry, Marianne, I just muted you again. <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2066.35s">I'm</a> just gonna wait for the clerk to get that language, then I'll go right to you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2111.196s">I</a> think just to that point, Vice President Bears, that's kind of similar to what we did with outdoor dining. <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2115.8s">We</a> had an update to our ordinances, and then we had a number of recommendations and policy things that fell under the building commissioner.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2126.775s">Is</a> it?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2128.536s">Yes,</a> it is.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2131.157s">I</a> do so much, I lose track sometimes.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2136.539s">I'm</a> sorry, Director O'Connor, I'm gonna go to you, then I'm gonna have Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2140.181s">All</a> right, I'm gonna push unmute, and then I'm gonna not touch anything.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2225.896s">So</a> you're asking if within this language, we want the board of health, some specific language as far as regulating those food trucks, which are ran into the zoning as being allowed on site at breweries. <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2236.885s">That's</a> the question?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2265.963s">Right,</a> and I think, yeah, I think we're probably, we're looking at two issues now. <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2269.644s">We're</a> looking at what we were talking about with the special event, and then I think you've raised an issue that we hadn't considered, I don't think, since that was passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2276.346s">So</a> obviously that's something that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2278.646s">And</a> then we're also just trying to address the special event permits, so.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2314.999s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2315.2s">And</a> I think I don't think we want we're not in the business of drafting legislation for specific businesses, but we do have. <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2320.884s">are</a> one brewery, and I think they've mostly or exclusively been relying on area restaurants. <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2326.59s">So</a> they haven't asked for a food truck there to my remembering. <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2330.653s">So</a> they've been open however long now, and that has not been an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2333.776s">It</a> doesn't mean that it's not something that could be addressed in our zoning, but I just want to raise that for background. <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2338.38s">Councilor</a> Tseng.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2387.458s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2389.078s">Going</a> to Director Schrader.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2411.683s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JPQiQSTu8Ag&t=2471.074s">Yeah,</a> I think that's fair point.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2377.6s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2378.421s">I</a> just want to make it very clear, I believe my fellow councilors have covered pretty much everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2383.429s">I</a> do just want to note that elections are objectively more complicated these days. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2387.615s">There's</a> early voting, there's permanent mail ballots, there's election day voting, and <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2392.977s">The</a> council, I think, really under the request and advisement of our previous elections coordinator, moved to that commission format to streamline this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2401.064s">And</a> unfortunately, as a result, that commission and that office, well, not the commission, but the office was understaffed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2406.828s">And</a> this is something that council pointed out time and time again. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2409.31s">We</a> asked for that office to be staffed up, and it was not heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2412.613s">So</a> we did one thing, and then we got a negative outcome from it, because the <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2418.143s">the</a> mayor's end was not upheld essentially from our wishes. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2421.125s">So</a> again, I think just want to make both those things clear that there is a lot of moving pieces. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2425.648s">There</a> are more moving pieces than there ever have been in our elections or local elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2430.151s">And</a> we made a change that was asked for and we believe would absolutely streamline and make this process easier, but without the staffing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2437.094s">It</a> doesn't work, so I appreciate Vice President Bears bringing that up, as well as the appropriation for that staffing that we've been asking for this whole time. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2443.879s">So</a> I'll go back to Vice President Bears, and then I know there's likely a lot of folks who want to speak on this, so I want to make sure we can open up the floor.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4839.236s">Okay,</a> and then in the same vein, again, knowing this is zoning, thoughts for LEED certification or something you would go for?

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4941.053s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4942.134s">Any</a> other questions or discussion from the council at this time? <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4945.176s">Also</a> knowing that we do have council with an S on the call, if anyone has questions there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/sqNChclwBCY&t=4952.442s">Councilor</a> Caraviello.

track. <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1295.871s">I</a> believe for this one in case we have any questions as far as legal questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1300.652s">So</a> happy to turn it over if folks want a reminder presentation from Victoria Storrs or if folks have questions to start off. <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1312.116s">I</a> will hand it over to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1313.416s">I</a> believe Victoria is on the call if she was. <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1315.937s">Recording</a> in progress. <a

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1324.087s">I</a> will hand it off to you to just kind of give a summary of, again, what is before the council tonight.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1438.821s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1443.202s">Questions</a> from the council or discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1449.217s">I</a> have one question because I don't have questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1451.918s">So</a> as this is a simple ordinance, if that is something that future council decides they would no longer like to take part in, it's just reversing the process of which is changing the ordinance or removing the ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1464.743s">There's</a> no other additional hoops to jump through should the council decide they don't, a future council decide they don't want to take part.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1492.928s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=1493.795s">Councilor</a> Caraviello.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6497.103s">And</a> we do have attorney ever on the call, but I believe in correspondence with her, she's not intimately familiar with what's before us tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6503.987s">So</a> she's also not our city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6508.229s">Does</a> that cover your question? <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6511.692s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6513.894s">Yes,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DIkPlkfnj9c&t=6515.396s">Councilor</a> Tseng.

href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2744.445s">Dear</a> Medford City Council members, I hope this message finds you well. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2747.046s">I'm</a> ready to draw your attention to a matter of considerable concern regarding the property situated at 66 Lyman Ave in Medford Hillside. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2753.589s">Recent</a> developments have highlighted serious violations of the city's short-term rental code at this location, prompting the need for a thorough examination. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2760.652s">Key</a> points of concern, I want to emphasize that I have taken proactive measures to address this situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2765.546s">I</a> personally reached out to Medford Code Enforcement Department to report these violations. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2769.689s">See</a> click issue ID 15172926. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2773.132s">In</a> response, they promptly conducted an onsite inspection and acknowledged that the apparent violations by issuing an official violation letter to the property owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2781.419s">However,</a> despite these actions, the property continues to function as an apparent illegal lodging establishment. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2787.023s">At</a> present, the property remains occupied by a substantial number of guests and is fully booked for the upcoming year. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2793.126s">operational</a> practices and consequences. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2794.907s">Based</a> on my investigation, it appears that 66 Lyman Ave is operating in a manner resembling an unauthorized boarding house. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2801.73s">The</a> proprietors, who reside in Winchester, have been renting individual bedrooms through Airbnb since 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2806.952s">The</a> operational model has resulted in a continuous influx of approximately six new guests each week for over two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2813.015s">The</a> practice raises serious concerns about security and potential health hazards for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2817.543s">Security</a> risks in our neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2818.744s">Beyond</a> potential code violations, the security risks associated with operating in a legal hotel in a quiet suburban neighborhood are significant. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2825.37s">The</a> constant turnover of unfamiliar individuals entering and exiting the premises disrupts the tranquility of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2831.209s">The</a> dynamic presents security concerns that extend beyond the property itself, affecting neighboring houses and streets, the heightened traffic flow, possible disturbances, and the unfamiliarity of temporary occupancy with local safety protocols amplifies these concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2844.415s">Identifying</a> regulatory barriers, digital evidence listed in CCLX fix report shows that there are several violations of the short-term rental zoning regulations at 66 Lyman Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2854.12s">It</a> is crucial to investigate potential factors impeding compliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2857.381s">Three</a> key areas of concern include <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2860.074s">Operator's</a> primary residence requirement is a requirement that a short-term rental property serves as the operator's primary residence appears to be compromised as evidenced by the absence of the owner slash operator and the transportation of supplies from an external location. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2874.44s">Sole</a> renter party mandate, the practice of renting multiple separate bedrooms of distinct groups as indicated by multiple listings for different bedrooms concurrently raises concerns about compliance with the single party rental mandate and guest count limitation. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2886.985s">The</a> observed operational activity prompts questions <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2889.557s">about</a> adherence to the stipulated guest limits for short-term rentals. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2893.338s">Impact</a> on local rental dynamics. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2895.299s">In</a> addition to potential regulatory infractions, there are implications for our local rental dynamics. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2899.8s">Short-term</a> rental practices have led to substantial disparities in rental rates, while traditional year-long lease for comparable property rents for approximately 3,500 per month, the same property on Airbnb commands around 6,000 per month. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2912.904s">This</a> trend distorts the local rental market, rendering long-term leases less accessible for residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2918.632s">preservation</a> of our community's well-being. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2920.233s">As</a> these complexities unfold, it is vital to address the situation promptly. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2923.975s">Upholding</a> established regulations and safeguarding our community's well-being are paramount. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2928.498s">I</a> urge you to enforce the new short-term rental codes for 66 Lyman Ave and all other illegal short-term rentals in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2936.483s">Your</a> thoughtful consideration is highly valued, and I am confident that your appropriate measures will be taken to address this matter in alignment with existing regulations and the best interests of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2945.308s">Sincerely,</a> Elliot Jockelson, 60 Marshall Street, Medford. <a

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=1504.608s">Okay,</a> so to understand, <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=1508.648s">So</a> it would be the regular solid waste, composting, yard grease, potentially three contracts?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=1519.356s">Okay,</a> because at this point, the composters that we're looking at, they don't pair up with like a... It would be a separate contract with the composting company. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=1530.944s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=1534.446s">Yeah,</a> that's the only question I have at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=1536.067s">I</a> did just want to know, <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=1537.265s">Myself,</a> I know there's many people in the city that partake, since doing compost, diapers aside, since doing compost, I mean, we barely have a bag of trash a week, and we know those bins can contain two, three bags of trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=1549.912s">So</a> it's been a huge noticeable difference for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=1552.714s">And</a> I think it would be exciting, particularly in these very hot days, to have the compost picked up weekly. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=1558.817s">So</a> that's just a personal note there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=1561.039s">But</a> I will go back to Councilor Caraviellola for more questions.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=1947.086s">Yep,</a> we can hear you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=1977.666s">Yep,</a> we have the folks in the booth can hear you so they can work on that and vice versa and bears is turning off the fans. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=1983.848s">So</a> that will definitely help.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=2021.367s">Yes,</a> and I think it's probably usually rats. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=2023.107s">Rats</a> will chew through anything, so it's usually rats.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=2109.085s">Something</a> like what?

do not do through this intersection. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=3047.698s">And</a> I want to say that I am ecstatic. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=3050.26s">I</a> think it looked a little bit better. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=3051.981s">That</a> was, you know, there are spots in Winchester too, where the paint actually is smudged and doesn't look great either. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=3056.504s">These</a> things happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=3057.835s">But</a> every single, with the exception of the extremely long crosswalk about from the Whitmore Brook entrance towards the cemetery, every crosswalk in that intersection was a blind crosswalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=3068.74s">You</a> cross and you hoped someone saw you, whether they were coming off of Playstead, they couldn't see you cross Winthrop. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=3073.542s">Whether</a> you're crossing Playstead and they're coming off Winthrop, they couldn't see you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=3077.604s">Imagine</a> having a stroller and pushing it in front of you and you hope to God someone sees you before they hit the stroller you're pushing for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=3086.211s">I</a> saw a woman a few weeks ago and the MBTA bus driver was actually extremely helpful in this situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=3091.355s">He</a> was wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=3092.136s">And</a> she was on the far side. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=3093.857s">She</a> was on the fell side and she was, she had like a walker, a roller, you know, walker with wheels and she was with her grandson. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=3100.682s">She</a> couldn't figure out which, which bus stop she needed to be at. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=3104.885s">And</a> she crossed over Winthrop street and then she crossed over place said twice because it's so wide right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=3109.449s">And</a> she got to the MBTA bus driver who told her actually you were in the right spot in the first place. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=3113.846s">And</a> I had entered the situation at that point and I had my elderly dog, would not walk any farther, so I couldn't help her. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=3120.15s">So</a> I sat there and I watched as she crossed the three streets again, and I held my breath. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=3125.293s">I</a> absolutely held my breath because I know how scary that intersection is. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=3129.175s">And</a> I just wanna know at what point we decided that that was acceptable, that for people to move as fast as they can, as they can in their cars is the more acceptable route. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=3142.112s">than</a> doing what we can to allow pedestrians to travel safely across streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=3146.555s">So</a> that's something that really frustrates me. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=3148.135s">I've</a> seen the discussion on Facebook that we are designing for a problem that doesn't exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=3152.938s">Those</a> people don't spend time in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=3154.959s">I</a> have seen countless people trying to cross that street. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=3159.162s">Rarely</a> someone will stop and let you cross the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=3161.463s">Someone</a> comes flying from Winchester and tries to go around them and tries to not intentionally, but almost nail someone in the crosswalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=3168.027s">It's</a> an incredibly dangerous intersection. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=3169.728s">And</a> since the interventions have been put in, <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=3171.97s">I've</a> seen so many people in the area biking and walking, and it's not because they weren't there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=3176.873s">They</a> have always been there, but they said, I'm not gonna cross that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=3180.435s">I'm</a> not gonna walk that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=3181.896s">That</a> area is terrifying. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=3183.537s">And</a> now they're out and they're using it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=3185.458s">And</a> I think it's wonderful to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=3187.339s">I'm</a> really happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=3188.74s">The</a> barriers are a little ugly. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=3190.2s">Yes,</a> I will take ugly a million times over for safety improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=3195.223s">And</a> I just wanna point out the fact that those very same barriers were begged for in front of some of the tonier streets in the city <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=3202.01s">prevent</a> people from parking and accessing the lakes. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=3205.532s">So</a> those barriers exist in other places in the city that people seem to have no issue with because it prevents people from having access. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=3212.015s">But</a> when we add them to increase access, people get mad. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=3216.297s">So</a> I'll step off my soapbox. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=3218.158s">But</a> again, I probably walk through this intersection or bike through it or drive through it a half a dozen times each day. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=3224.261s">And</a> I want to be clear that I absolutely support <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=3227.516s">what</a> has been done there, and I've heard from many people that support it, and I haven't heard from any people that probably don't even think to reach out, because they're biking and they're walking and they're enjoying it, and they're not thinking of emailing people about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sJ05aGDSdsU&t=3238.804s">So,</a> I know we have a member of the public who would like to speak, so.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4477.825s">How</a> far did those abutter notices go out?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4524.114s">I</a> can search the corporate history for 400.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4688.32s">I</a> guess was there any additional legal understanding that attorney Bobrowski helped us in writing this was there any additional legal consultation in this process, as far as understanding that these are the steps that need to be taken.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4754.679s">So</a> is that enough? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4759.36s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4759.66s">Director,</a> just so I can understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4761.861s">So</a> this is, what's before us isn't the result. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4766.062s">This</a> is not triggered by our new zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4767.642s">This</a> is something that was already there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4768.882s">It's</a> just a series of papers together that has not been presented like this in a number of years, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4773.584s">That</a> is correct.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5810.48s">Do</a> you have a way of enforcing that?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5813.919s">Well,</a> in Medford we had a 18 wheeler I think that was supposed to be taking a certain route and they didn't and they slammed into an overpass and destroyed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5822.827s">So</a> I think we've, we've been a little bit burned on that in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5825.889s">So</a> just want to raise that as an example.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7107.005s">Can</a> I just ask one specific question about the building? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=7109.968s">The</a> roofing color, is it light or is it a black roof?

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8336.853s">Did</a> I?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8642.351s">Sure.</a>

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8919.314s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8919.755s">And</a> same with the street trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8921.237s">Is</a> that something that? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8922.358s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8944.753s">Whereas</a> this is a public hearing, we need to open it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8947.955s">So</a> I will open the public hearing, portion of the public hearing for anyone who would like to speak in favor of this petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8956.3s">So</a> speaking only in favor of this petition, assuming the petitioner, if anyone wants to, any of you say yes, you speak in favor of this, you are, yes, great. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8965.526s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8966.487s">Anyone</a> else on Zoom or in person who would like to speak in favor of this petition? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8972.199s">Jeff,</a> if you could stop sharing the screen just so I can see everyone on zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8977.104s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8978.425s">And</a> we'd like to speak in favor of this position. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8981.108s">Seeing</a> none, this portion of the public hearing is closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8983.51s">Anyone</a> who would like to speak in opposition, opposition of this petition? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=8989.075s">Just</a> name and address for the record, please.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9408.518s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9409.979s">Anyone</a> else who would like to speak in opposition of the permit, either in person or on Zoom? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9418.401s">Seeing</a> none. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9421.397s">This</a> portion of the public hearing is closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9423.4s">It</a> seems like we probably still have a few questions from Councilors, or if you want to respond to any of the questions that were raised from residents.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9783.848s">Any</a> other questions from the council at this time? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9786.009s">I</a> just had, I think Councilor Caraviello touched on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9789.95s">Does</a> Raising Canyon, or specifically this location, would it contract with like Uber Eats or Grubhub or something that... No. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9796.253s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9797.025s">Great,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9799.847s">You</a> don't do delivery on your own either? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9801.508s">No,</a> okay, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9805.21s">Do</a> I have any further questions or motion or? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9815.377s">Was</a> that a motion to approve or? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9820.12s">So</a> the public, I did close the public hearing earlier and I continued questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9834.11s">So</a> would that be to extend this to, it would be to continue the hearing to the next regular meeting?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9861.314s">But</a> I think we need to notify the petitioner when this would be voted on again. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9871.097s">So</a> you would want to call a special meeting of the city council to vote on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9878.239s">I'm</a> asking you, is that... <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9885.663s">Okay,</a> yeah, I mean, I think so be it July 11 is the next regular meeting we could hold a special meeting.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9900.808s">Well,</a> yeah.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9908.431s">I</a> close the opposition side. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9911.592s">You</a> can motion to keep it open. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9914.009s">motion</a> to keep it open or reopen or continue it to the next regular meeting?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9954.896s">Councilor</a> Knight, would you withdraw your motion in favor and allow Vice President Bears or?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10107.772s">So</a> there's a site plan approval, that's one vote, and then there's a special permit, correct?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10151.697s">Any</a> other conditions from councilors outside of what's already been stated?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10245.068s">Understood.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10247.03s">Councilors,</a> there's also the ability to continue the public hearing until we can have legal representation.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10278.332s">And</a> just for clarity, we did the last time we had a special permit, we did keep the public hearing open until we had legal representation, which we did the next meeting.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10440.01s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10441.519s">So</a> we have a motion from Councilor Collins, which is to move for approval, including the conditions from the CD board, a 30, 60, 90 day review. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10455.05s">Sorry.</a>

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10518.487s">So</a> we have multiple special permits so we can take them separately.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10545.539s">Okay,</a> so we have the drive-through special permit request. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10559.084s">We</a> have waiving the off-street voting special permit request. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10563.257s">And</a> we have the extended hours special request. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10567.1s">We</a> have the site plan.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10583.511s">Do</a> you wanna take this site plan last or first? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10589.014s">The</a> order we got it from the CD board is special part for drive through a special part for extended hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10593.717s">waiver</a> of off-street learning requirements, and then site plan review. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10596.378s">So</a> I'm happy with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10600.799s">Take</a> them over, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10607.18s">So</a> I believe Councilor Collins, your motion was to approve the site plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10610.061s">So</a> do I have a motion to approve the special plan for drive-through use?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10634.959s">Is</a> that what you'd like to apply the 30, 60, 90 day to? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10637.26s">Yes.</a>

are tired and want to go home. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5509.266s">So,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5511.512s">23-315</a> which I think we have next and if not that's what we're taking offered by Councilor Caraviello Councilor Tseng and Councilor Collins, whereas hundreds of Massachusetts residents die or injured from incidents involving firearms every year, and whereas in Massachusetts an average of 16 children and teens die by guns every year of which 21% are suicide and 78% are homicides and <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5535.384s">Whereas</a> the rate of death by gun homicide in Massachusetts is 18 times higher for black people than it is for white people, a vastly disproportionate threat of harm and whereas 38% of female intimate partner homicide victims in Massachusetts are killed with a gun and whereas Massachusetts police agencies reported more than 2800 firearms as lost or stolen to the National Crime Information Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5557.998s">from</a> 2016 to 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5559.96s">And</a> whereas Massachusetts law establishes legal requirements for firearm storage in homes and vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5565.624s">And</a> anytime the firearm is not carried by or under the control of the gun owner or other lawfully authorized user and whereas Massachusetts law contains criminal penalties for people who fail to securely stare store firearms as required by law and whereas gun violence costs Massachusetts 3.5 billion each year of which 85.4 million is paid by taxpayers and <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5587.785s">Whereas</a> beyond the Massachusetts safe storage law, the American Academy of Pediatrics AP states that the best approach to keep children and teens safe is to secure firearms locked and loaded with ammunition separately and whereas 4.6 million children nationwide live in homes with at least one loaded and unlocked firearm and whereas <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5605.561s">The</a> US Secret Service has found that 76% of school shooters under age 18 obtain their guns from the home of a parent or a close relative. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5612.863s">And</a> whereas over 80% of children 18 or younger who died by firearm suicide use a firearm belonging to a family member. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5619.985s">And</a> whereas raising awareness about secure firearm storage is one solution to helping reduce the risk of gun violence, particularly among children and teens due to suicides and unintentional shootings. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5629.468s">And</a> whereas across the country, <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5631.389s">lawmakers,</a> community members and local leaders are working together to implement secure storage programs and whereas safety and well being of our community is a top priority of Medford and whereas we believe that most gun owners want to be responsible gun owners and whereas both gun owners and non gun owners have a role to play in keeping our community safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5650.375s">be</a> therefore resolved that the Medford City Council reaffirms its commitment to the safety, health and welfare of all of its residents, including through the promotion of the secure storage and handling of firearms, be it further resolved the Medford City Council request that the mayor implement a secure firearm storage program <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5665.937s">including</a> the distribution of relevant educational brochures or materials about secure gun storage and state law regarding secure storage of firearms in Medford public buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5675.246s">Be</a> it further resolved that the Medford City Council requests that the Medford Police Department provide relevant educational materials pertaining to secure firearm storage, Massachusetts law regarding firearm storage and the risk of unsecured firearm storage when licensing new gun owners or renewing existing licenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-MzuLbfz14&t=5691.995s">for</a> the result of the Medford City Council request that the Medford Board of Health work with the mayor's office and Medford Police Department to assist with the dissemination of secure firearm storage materials throughout the community.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=3242.159s">The</a> town is what tipped me off.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=3252.092s">Please</a> continue.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=3272.488s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=3501.423s">On</a> that one specifically, I live right over there and I walk that delay so I'm intimately familiar. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=3506.924s">The</a> proposed stop, isn't there some significant trees there and some like, there's some like the sidewalks a little raised there, like not intentionally?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=3557.218s">Okay,</a> and then just because this just made me think of it, are any of these proposals, will there be removal of trees to make these accommodations? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=3565.759s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=3568.139s">Councilor</a> Tseng, sorry.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=3797.48s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=3798.04s">Vice</a> President Bears, did you have something to that point?

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=3902.621s">Okay,</a> and to clarify on that, so suggestions like adding the RFBs <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=3908.527s">that</a> would be considered as part of the affirmative vote? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=3911.552s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=3914.878s">Councilor</a> Collins.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=3995.805s">Just</a> one second.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=3996.625s">Your</a> mic's not on. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=3997.486s">It's</a> not your fault.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4039.255s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4040.216s">I</a> think we can move on to the next one. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4045.28s">I</a> do, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4053.972s">I</a> do see him on the call. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4057.535s">Director</a> Blake, are you available just to speak on this specific stop?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4065.601s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4068.743s">Councilor</a> Collins, you had a specific question or just deferring what the expert... Deferring. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4074.868s">Deferring</a> your expertise stop, Director Blake.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4186.591s">Thank</a> you, Director Blake. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4187.431s">And</a> also, I guess a comment is, there does start to be an incline on that street. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4192.774s">As</a> you move further up, further towards Winchester, I think if we're talking about accessibility, that's something that I'm sure you've considered it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4198.136s">But</a> I just want to put another plug for that.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4204.053s">Okay,</a> but I think just also just getting to, you know, getting up that hill, I think is something that perhaps should be considered. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4210.875s">Correct.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4215.717s">Councilor</a> Neill.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4263.34s">Okay,</a> first, right, you're saying you want to take the elimination.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4274.746s">I</a> mean, we can continue to go through the
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4286.406s">I</a> think you may have seen that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4287.606s">There</a> are some, there are some strong feelings about this.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4312.454s">And</a> I hear that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4313.015s">I</a> think what we're talking about now is the fact that there's an opportunity for improvements at the cost of the MBTA and making sure that we get all the improvements we can.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4392.16s">Yes,</a> and to be fair, I live right near G1, so I, you know.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4398.642s">Yeah,</a> it's a disclosure on the website.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4402.664s">Yes,</a> I'm just saying, we may, there's some spots some of us are intimately familiar with, and perhaps we might have a little bit more insight, so.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4486.32s">I</a> think everyone probably does. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4488.582s">Vice</a> President Bears.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4547.877s">It's</a> also incredibly dangerous for pedestrians, so.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=230.978s">Yeah,</a> one of the things for running that is something that it's a massive privilege that I will always go back to is I had a 9 to 5 job that was very respectful of my time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=242.707s">So</a> on the weekends, I can knock doors. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=245.089s">After</a> hours, I can knock doors. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=246.731s">I</a> did not have a child at the time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=248.032s">I</a> didn't have to worry about child care. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=249.313s">So</a> the ability to knock doors and have those face-to-face conversations <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=254.738s">I</a> think were really important. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=256.119s">And</a> that's that comes from a massive place of privilege. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=260.023s">I</a> also did have because I was active in my ward Democratic committee, I had a few old hands as as they're called. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=267.932s">So</a> people who, you know, one person who's been in Medford, you know, for 75 years, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=273.677s">could</a> really speak to just the history of politics and things like that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=276.438s">And</a> he was always willing, some of you may know him, Len Gliana, so he was always willing to just lend his historical perspective, which didn't always exactly align with my politics, but just like having that to be able to listen to, I think, and really understanding where I was running in a way I didn't before, I think was really important. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=294.661s">So</a> probably those two things, time, and if you can, an old hand, as they're called.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=314.025s">Yeah,</a> I mean, I think if, you know, depending, I'm not sure how active the Republican Party is in Medford, but I know the Democratic Party, there are ward committees, and that's a great way, you know, it's a great conduit just for those political conversations. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=325.33s">You</a> will, if you want, you can run to attend the caucus, and at the caucus, there's going to be hundreds, I'm sorry, there'll be the caucus, and there'll be the convention. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=332.594s">At</a> the convention, there's going to be hundreds of people like you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=335.895s">So</a> even though they might not be from Medford, they're people who kind of understand the lay of the land of local politics. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=341.237s">That's</a> really great. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=343.177s">Boards</a> and commissions, if you have the time to be able to dedicate that, or just, you know, watch the city council meeting, watch a school committee, watch a ZBA meeting. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=352.78s">It</a> can absolutely feel like they're speaking a different language at first, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=356.241s">But</a> you start to kind of understand, like, what are the issues people are talking about? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=359.484s">What</a> are the issues Councilors are talking about? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=361.165s">What</a> are the issues residents are talking about? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=362.586s">Because</a> they're not always the same thing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=364.848s">And</a> just kind of dip your toe in that way. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=368.051s">There's</a> also great, there's free trainings, they're mine, it's escaping me right now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=373.161s">The</a> free trainings I can't think of right now, but one I actually did emerge, which is training for democratic women. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=378.687s">I</a> did a boot camp for that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=380.169s">So</a> that's something else that was really helpful. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=382.511s">And</a> that gave information about you know what you need to do for fundraising and you know things you need to know here's how to pick. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=389.158s">or</a> narrow down your, you know, your five policy points that you want to talk about on the doors. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=394.823s">And</a> that was also just really helpful for the sense that I was in this room with like 40 other women who also wanted to do this, what feels like a crazy thing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=403.571s">So</a> that was just like a network to be able to go back to, too. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=406.414s">So</a> I think there's <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=408.415s">Try</a> to learn what's going on by popping into a meeting. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=411.856s">Look</a> for those training opportunities. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=413.276s">There's</a> also some great books. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=415.096s">I</a> think I read a book that's been around. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=416.536s">It's</a> kind of old. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=417.437s">It</a> may be 20 years old at this point. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=419.097s">But</a> it's literally called How to Win a Local Election. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=421.737s">And</a> some of this stuff isn't going to apply because it's written by someone not in Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=427.518s">I</a> think they were in Texas or something. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=429.979s">But</a> there's some stuff that now is a total no-brainer, but then wouldn't have even thought of. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=437.781s">Yeah,</a> look for meetings. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=439.243s">Google</a> is your friend. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=440.225s">Look</a> for free trainings. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=441.186s">There's</a> lots of resources out there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=443.069s">It</a> all takes time though, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=444.151s">And</a> we're not, not all of us have the privilege of time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=446.695s">Sure.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=490.566s">Sure,</a> so the Gender Equity Ordinance was something that actually a lot of surrounding communities passed as early as the 80s. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=497.85s">And</a> it's something that when it was passed in the 80s, it was called the Women's Commission or some form of that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=504.954s">And</a> then as we updated it for present times, Gender Equity Commission. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=508.116s">But</a> just understanding that in all ways, different genders are represented in city views in ways they might not be. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=519.766s">with</a> the current elected bodies. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=522.108s">So</a> it was a way of empowering folks, giving them the opportunity for a new boarding commission that they can look through things through the lens of gender equity, whether it's a new policy that school committee or city council is passing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=532.276s">And</a> not to say that they would have power over that, but they would be a board that would be organized in this intention. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=538.821s">And</a> as this work goes on, they could say, hey, let's reach out to the city council and say, we have some thoughts on this. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=543.625s">Whereas</a> right now you might just have individuals that if they're paying attention can say, oh, this thing, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=548.469s">you</a> know, it's harmful, this is important, and something like that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=550.851s">So</a> it's just establishing a new commission in the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=553.914s">It's</a> something that we actually haven't taken up yet this year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=558.198s">We've</a> got a lot of stuff we're moving on, and that one's been, it's been a little challenging as far as, like, how much power we can give it, how much power folks want to give that body, because, I mean, I think there's, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=573.321s">There's</a> some bodies that actually can subpoena as a women's commission and things like that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=578.043s">So</a> I think we're just trying to find the right balance of, we want to design it so it's a board that people who might be new to boards and commissions would be involved with, because I think, and they're doing important work, these people, but I think we tend to see a lot of the same people, you know, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=598.397s">In</a> these spaces in Medford and any city that they have the time to volunteer, they have the capacity to volunteer for these things, but you're not getting this representative view that you'd like. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=608.066s">So</a> we're trying we had been trying to design it in a way that we can make sure we have a representative from each board in the city plus 1 and things like that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=615.732s">And</a> it just. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=616.733s">It</a> just got a little bit into the weeds. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=619.574s">And</a> I think we're just trying to find the opportunity where we can pull it back up. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=623.776s">And</a> I think one of the things we're waiting on there is just not having our own city solicitor right now and really wanting that like in-house opinion on something that's kind of like as a very, very specific aim. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=635.881s">And</a> we don't want to copy and paste maybe from something that was passed in Somerville in 1984 because, you know, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=642.119s">It's</a> almost 40 years since then. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=643.28s">So,</a> it's still on the radar. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=645.261s">It's</a> still important, but we just, it's something that unfortunately when you want to do it right, it can take a lot of time.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=660.491s">It's</a> really a commission to make sure that, yeah, you know, historically it was a commission or when these other seas passed, it was commissioned to make sure women had a voice when they often didn't have a voice in politics. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=670.868s">And</a> now in present day, it's, you know, it's expanding that umbrella and making sure those folks, you know, those underrepresented folks, you know, whatever their gender identity is making sure that they have a voice and just specifically focused on these issues. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=682.252s">So</a> yeah, and it may be stuff that isn't, you know, even talked about at school committee or city council, it may go the other way where they say, oh, we have this policy that we think Medford should adopt. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=690.755s">So</a> it's kind of like, I think the idea is a two way street. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=693.156s">And</a> I think it's also, you know, just fostering maybe it's events or bringing in speakers. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=697.337s">So</a> just kind of, you know, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=699.098s">building</a> that group, probably not dissimilar for some of the ways the Human Rights Commission works, where I think it's, you know, having these certain focuses, sometimes it's policy, sometimes it's more, you know, broad events and things like that, and just trying to adjust what the needs are, and also what the commission wants to focus on.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=740.646s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=740.886s">And</a> that's a really good point, because I think, you know, I think this was something that was brought up in the debates, the last session on the council was kind of like, we have a woman mayor, we have this number of women politicians, this is an outdated thing, we don't need this anymore. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=754.675s">And</a> I think you bring up a really good point, Danielle, where it's like, this is the kind of random bips and bobs that actually, you know, it's like, oh, we forgot to write about women, or, you know, this kind of stuff. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=763.06s">But</a> it's just like, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=764.7s">you</a> know, sometimes we're on scary times and wouldn't it be great to codify that, that we exist and we're allowed to hold power in the city and things like that, that, you know, it doesn't seem like we have to do, maybe we do.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=796.612s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=797.892s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=798.193s">I</a> think that was intentional. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=799.853s">I'm</a> just really wanting to put that on display. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=802.454s">The</a> school committee has always had, not always, but in recent years has had a fair number, if not mostly women representatives, but it wasn't always the case on city council. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=814.057s">We're</a> still quite underrepresented. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=815.398s">It's</a> two out of seven. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=817.078s">But</a> just seeing that incremental shift and then seeing that the positions of power on each body and then the mayor, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=823.82s">I</a> think it's really important, like optics matter. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=825.808s">And</a> I think, yeah, it was really good to see that.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=868.363s">kind</a> of two main roles, and then like a lot of unofficial roles, but the two main roles are to chair the meetings. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=872.827s">And</a> then also you essentially set the agenda. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=874.748s">I</a> decide, you know, or I mean, I try to decide, like, I'll talk to vices or bears, but, you know, and of course, I'll ask folks for what kind of meetings or what subcommittee meetings they want. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=883.695s">But,</a> you know, I set the calendar for what our committees as a whole are. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=886.718s">So</a> that, you know, it helps me, you know, planning out, it has to come from the council, but then planning out when we're going to have these meetings. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=892.783s">So</a> it's in some sense, it's kind of an agenda setting role. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=896.332s">I'm</a> not going to ignore fellow Councilors if we pass a resolution for committee of the whole, we're going to have that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=901.994s">But</a> it does, it's a little bit agenda setting as far as like priority or how soon or making sure things move along. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=908.697s">So</a> as far as chair, I mean, my hope was, it's just like, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=914.265s">making</a> the council a little bit more, you know, comfortable place for people to speak up. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=919.626s">I</a> mean, we're still not quite there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=921.187s">I</a> mean, even just the building, just by design of the building itself, it's very intimidating. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=926.288s">You</a> know, these giant high ceilings, the lectern, you know, you've got cameras in your face, and the TV screens right there, you have to stare at yourself as you're talking, and that can be really challenging. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=935.731s">But</a> just making sure to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=938.145s">try</a> to make it clear that this is a space where we're going to be respectful. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=941.187s">We're</a> not going to yell at each other as much as we can. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=944.89s">And</a> everyone is welcome to speak, which has always been the case. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=948.592s">But</a> saying it's welcoming and doing the things to try to make it welcome are two different things. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=955.597s">I'm</a> absolutely not perfect on it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=957.899s">It's</a> very challenging to manage people that are passionate about things and really want to be heard. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=964.743s">So</a> it's a fine balancing act of, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=967.625s">not</a> trying to cut anyone off, but you're kind of always waiting a little bit, you know, for not someone to cross a line, but it's like, you know, I don't, you know, no one's getting talked bad about, no one's getting like yelled at as much as I can stop it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=979.813s">So</a> it's trying to manage just people who are really passionate about things, you know, all matter of things and making sure people feel heard and we move along in a timely manner and things like that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=991.6s">And</a> then, yeah, going back to the agenda setting, it's just making sure that <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=995.165s">the</a> issues that we're focused on get moved along, that we're able to just schedule those meetings. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1000.586s">And</a> we do keep a pretty robust calendar. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1003.527s">You</a> know, we, the council meets in some form, like usually at least twice a week, you know, and everyone else has a full-time job in addition to that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1011.808s">So</a> it's challenging, but that's how we're trying to move, or I'm trying to move, I think, some of the more progressive ideals forward. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1019.69s">Of</a> course, you have to have <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1021.561s">a</a> progressive majority to get those resolutions passed to then schedule those meetings, which is where we are now, but then just making sure that we're actually having those meetings that are called for and the right people are invited and we can get the insight and information we need to move forward.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1049.03s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1049.451s">So,</a> I mean, we've made progress. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1050.872s">We've</a> actually advanced some really big things in the past few weeks. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1053.794s">We</a> finalized some things that have been worked on, honestly, for years at this point. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1058.177s">One</a> was the Housing Stability Notification Ordinance, which is a series of paperwork that landlords have to reside so folks, the renters know the resources available to them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1068.664s">So,</a> it's just, you know, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1070.887s">Ideally,</a> just a minor extra step of paperwork. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1073.168s">So</a> renters know the resources that should they, you know, ever, you know, be housing insecure or anything like that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1078.789s">They</a> know the legal resources. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1079.969s">They</a> know that public offering resources and things like that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1084.791s">The</a> other was the CCOPS ordinance, which is citizen control over public surveillance use. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1090.172s">that's</a> something that's been in the works, I wanna say at least for four years, honestly, it's probably longer. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1094.655s">And</a> very simply, this is just asking anyone in city departments who are asking to use new surveillance technology to come before the city council, tell us what it is, provide a report by the end of it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1110.125s">And</a> the city council does have to vote on it, but understanding that we are not experts, we're not claiming to be experts, but I know I voted for it because I believe there's power in <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1120.897s">knowing</a> what's out there, knowing what kind of tech is being used. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1123.88s">And</a> I think there is, you know, some of this, a lot of this tech that's coming out, you know, can be questionable and it has a whole lot of issues. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1130.465s">So</a> understanding what is being out there, what is being asked to be used, and then also how it's being used after, you know, if it's approved, getting that report, just a very, a yearly, very short report on how it's being used.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1145.19s">Yeah,</a> so I mean, it's stuff, the idea is that it's things you can't even think of, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1149.893s">I</a> mean, I think we all, not to say we all, you know, if you do digging, it's, maybe this is like an oversimplification of it, but I think, you know, if we think of like, say, pharmaceutical companies, they have this great new drug, and they bring it to doctors and are like, cool, let me give this to my patients. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1167.484s">You</a> know, I believe, stories I've read, things I understand, similar stuff may happen with, you know, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1172.968s">just</a> city departments that some company comes out with XYZ tech, it's gonna solve all your problems, here you go. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1179.432s">And</a> I think the hope is that, you know, the city council and just in general, just the public, learning that XYZ tech, you know, may be put in, we can pause and say, hey, hasn't been tested, is this actually going to do what we want it to do? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1193.222s">Or,</a> you know, just letting people know it exists. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1195.904s">Because</a> I think, you know, there are issues with surveillance technology, as we know, it's, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1202.56s">It's</a> notoriously not good at all as far as identifying facial features of black and brown individuals. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1208.203s">It's</a> developed and tested by white folks, so it's like the technology has a number of issues. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1217.278s">So</a> I think just understanding that stuff as it comes forward. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1220.039s">So</a> there are a lot of things that, things that kind of count as different types of surveillance that are in use by the city that were exempted, you know, just making sure that like it's stuff related to like elections and poll pads and things like that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1233.224s">So</a> it's not just what the police are using, you know, it could be some new thing from the parking department. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1240.167s">So</a> just understanding like surveillance tech is kind of increasingly <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1244.007s">everywhere</a> and just making folks aware of what our city is using or maybe asking to use.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1270.032s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1270.272s">And</a> this is something that is like one of my main frustrations that I speak about and some other Councilors speak about where federal policy, state level policy is kind of woefully behind the eight ball as far as tech. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1282.725s">So</a> we're left, at the municipal level, we're just like, okay, what can we do? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1286.007s">If</a> they're not gonna write something about privacy and surveillance and security in Congress, or they're not gonna do it at the state house, what can we do here? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1293.911s">And</a> I think it was important for me to say, this isn't a comment necessarily on anything that's happening now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1299.794s">It's</a> just understanding that technology that we can't even conceive of is going to come down and we have to figure out how to deal with it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1306.058s">Otherwise,</a> they're making the decisions for us.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1313.48s">And</a> then the other big thing we just passed. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1315.541s">And</a> again, this two of these just passed for first reading, so they have to go over a second and third reading. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1320.182s">There's</a> generally usually not a hold up between those but is the affordable housing trust. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1325.764s">So</a> that gives additional kind of like buying and spending power within the CPA. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1331.465s">So</a> that's exciting to that gives us more power to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1335.201s">And</a> basically gives us the ability to put funds into an affordable housing trust to buy or finance affordable housing and just really increase the affordable housing opportunities within the city.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C20H0aSUeq50g0RQdbdhQ?t=1359.472s">Green.</a>

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6302.68s">So</a> the conditions- When you get some of the conditions, you'll understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6305.961s">There</a> are conditions of the permit itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6307.841s">So</a> if they do not meet these conditions, their permit will be revoked. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6311.542s">So</a> it's not just- That's why there's more security. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6315.122s">It's</a> not just a handshake. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6316.162s">These</a> are conditions of the permit itself.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6355.734s">And</a> I think that's really helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6356.615s">And</a> even just the, you know, people hiding stuff in the trees and the bushes over there, that's really helpful to know because we're not there all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6362.119s">We</a> don't know that.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6433.444s">evening.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6433.724s">Name</a> and address for the record, please.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6764.032s">Name</a> and address for the record, please.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6899.453s">Thank</a> you.

href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6925.974s">Any</a> further thoughts would like to comment? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6930.27s">Before</a> we get to the conditions, I do just want to reiterate my point from two weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6935.254s">This</a> is not something I want to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6936.655s">If</a> it were my choice, we would not be approving any more fossil fuel infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6941.719s">It's</a> not something we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6942.56s">It's</a> not the way the future is going. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6944.301s">And</a> I'm also, to the attorney's previous point last week, I do not believe BJ's is doing this out of the goodness of their heart. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6950.886s">I</a> do not believe that, no offense. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6953.609s">And</a> it is because that, that I do believe I have to go yes for this because we have set these conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6958.376s">that</a> address the issues that the neighbors have had. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6960.657s">And</a> I believe that if we are losing court, if we were to go back again, we're not going to get anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6965.119s">And</a> we won't address any of those conditions because I don't believe this is a goodness of the heart issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6969.3s">This</a> is a legal matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6970.24s">This</a> is a agreement that we're trying to set forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6972.761s">And</a> that's why I'll be voting affirmatively. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6974.802s">I</a> could vote no. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6976.163s">And</a> my conscience says that to get the neighbors what they need, it has to be a yes vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6984.127s">going</a> to the conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6985.608s">So</a> we have a motion from Vice President Bears to approve with the conditions and the conditions are and these are from the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6991.371s">These</a> are in addition to the plans that came before the council, which have a number of traffic and safety changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6997.415s">So</a> landscaping one BJ's will implement an advance in advanced maintenance program, which will consist of weekly parking lot sweeping <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7005.058s">and</a> day porter service three days a week to remove any litter in BJ's parking lot. <a

dead trees with new trees and shrubs in the public right of way along Woodruff Avenue, consistent with the plans discussed at the January 17th hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7080.394s">The</a> new landscaping will become city property upon planting. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7083.966s">If</a> any such new landscaping dies of natural causes and not because of snowplow or other inflicted harm caused by the city or other third parties, BJs will replace each such landscaping for as long as the gas station is in operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7097.479s">BJs</a> will have no other duties in the right of way other than landscaping replacement if and when needed. <a

activities to confirm that the conditions of its fuel storage license are satisfied to a representative of the city to be designated by the City Council. <a

will not publicize such contact information or place the contact information on the city's website, but the city may provide such information to residents or public officials who request such information. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7148.216s">Pedestrians</a> and traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7150.257s">BJs</a> will employ vehicular traffic patterns for the

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1274.735s">Thank</a> you vice chair Graham for that introduction and for the work that your colleagues have done in the past years. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1279.557s">I</a> know some people say that school committee is actually the hardest job in politics and I'm chatting with you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1284.6s">I</a> would agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1286.141s">Thank</a> you to mayor Longo Cohn for inviting me to speak tonight to share some highlights from the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1291.464s">If</a> there is a child squealing during it, it's my child. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1293.745s">So</a> it's totally fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1295.846s">I'm</a> honored to serve as the president of the Medford city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1298.627s">And</a> I'm very proud of the work that we've accomplished in the more than 100 meetings we've held since January, 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1305.182s">We</a> worked on new ordinances, voted for a charter review, approved funding for some transformative projects, and completed the recodification of our zoning code, all in support of a more livable, vibrant, and sustainable Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1317.956s">So</a> much of what we do as a council is a work in progress, because good work takes time. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1322.52s">Time</a> to work with one another as Councilors, like Councilor Carballo, who I see here tonight, <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1327.153s">time</a> to hear from and work with residents, time to balance competing viewpoints, and time to respond to the tremendous efforts from our city departments, boards, and commissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1336.039s">Over</a> the past year plus, the council has been focused on housing, continuing the work of establishing an affordable housing trust, providing suggestions for the city's comprehensive plan, voting in favor of the housing production plan, and working to establish a housing notification ordinance, all of which aim to provide housing opportunities and support for residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1354.434s">Early</a> last year, the council finalized and voted in favor of a zoning recodification, the first comprehensive review and reform of Bedford zoning in decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1363.337s">The</a> updated zoning is clear and concise and lays the groundwork for sustainable development and housing opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1369.439s">I</a> look forward to phase two of our zoning work, and I thank the mayor for allocating funding for that, and in this work where we can once again work with city departments to update our zoning to support residents and work in concert with the comprehensive plan for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1381.809s">In</a> addition to our zoning work, the council has worked to modernize ordinances and policy around outdoor dining and food trucks in the city, responding to our business community and our residents to support a bustling Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1392.475s">We</a> passed a polystyrene ban within the city, spearheaded first by students in the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1398.999s">And</a> with this, Medford joins communities around the state, taking seriously the harmful impacts of this type of pollution and our commitment to sustainability. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1406.994s">The</a> council also voted to tie the senior property tax deferral limit to the senior circuit breaker tax credit, which automatically expands eligibility for this program each year and helps seniors stay in their homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1417.799s">Last</a> year, we updated our snow removal ordinance and delivered a number of policy suggestions to the administration to streamline snow removal guidance and hopefully someday pilot a city run sidewalk clearing program in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1430.425s">We</a> did all of this with the help of residents and importantly, the city boards and commissions and the staff in this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1436.445s">They</a> are partners in this work and they provide invaluable expertise and insight. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1440.546s">And</a> I thank those city staff for being so giving of their time to support this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1445.668s">We</a> still have much work to accomplish and I'm confident we can work together as one in city hall to move forward with zoning updates, move forward with a more sustainable and resilient Medford and move forward with review of our city charter to ensure it reflects the city that we are today. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1458.292s">I</a> want to thank you all for your time and allowing me to share some of the highlights that we have done as a body working together and working with the people in this very building. <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1466.584s">And</a> with that, I would like to introduce the Honorable Mayor of Medford, Brianna Lundekarp.<h2><a

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=284.39s">And</a> nice to see you all, and nice to be back.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=904.225s">Thanks,</a> Brie. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=906.444s">So</a> before we get into kind of the five themes, we wanted to take a bit of a step back and I'll move pretty quickly through this since there's a lot of overlap with what we shared with you all last summer and also since you've been sitting with the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=921.723s">but</a> thinking about the fact that Medford has done a lot of planning work at different levels and on different topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=927.828s">And</a> so part of the role of this plan is to really bring together current and past plans and to understand how these components relate holistically to one another. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=936.193s">And</a> so we looked at the history of land use and development in Medford and considered that together with current trends and citywide patterns. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=948.102s">And</a> then <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=948.865s">projecting</a> that out to the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=950.886s">And</a> so this is sort of, the future land use map is this diagrammatic way of thinking about the different areas in Medford and the strategies this plan has for addressing those areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=962.254s">So</a> here you can see some highlighted elements such as the green corridor along the rivers, gateway entries to the city shown there in blue, civic and institutional anchors, those centers and squares of economic activity, <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=977.772s">and</a> then also kind of smaller, more village centers at the neighborhood scale. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=981.294s">And</a> so thinking about how all these different areas of investment and a different character relate to one another and what they look like in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=992.319s">And</a> so, as Brie mentioned, the five building blocks really came out of community engagement and input, and all of these were themes that were refined over the course of this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1005.657s">And</a> these were open and engaged communication, welcoming and supportive neighborhoods, vibrant places, access for all, and climate resiliency. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1017.147s">So</a> we'll dig into those just a little bit to provide a high level overview of what these look like, but there are many more actions and elements within the chapters themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1028.156s">So</a> I encourage everyone to take a closer look and looking forward to discussion with you all after this. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1034.685s">So</a> first, open and engaged communication, and this includes the relationship between the community and City Hall, how plans like these get implemented over time, allocation of funding, and how the City relates to other potential partners who can help to implement elements of this plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1052.229s">So</a> some of the goals that came out here were to grow and strengthen community trust, to implement the plan according to community-supported priorities, <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1064.677s">and</a> also allocating resources effectively to make sure that this plan can be effective going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1070.038s">And</a> so just to highlight a few of the actions that are contained in this chapter, the plan recommends issuing an annual comprehensive plan update that will show progress made on the plan and really create that transparency with the community about actions that have been taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1090.981s">Offering</a> communication and training to <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1094.468s">residents</a> and staff, including mediation training and thinking about how we're communicating with the rest of the community, tracking participation demographics in planning processes and on boards to really see who's in the room and how we can expand the reach of both membership of boards and commissions, but also of who's engaged in public processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1121.924s">And</a> then also identifying partners who can help to implement this plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1124.965s">There</a> are a lot of actions and recommendations and steps in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1128.887s">So</a> how can the city now do this alone and thinking about how to strategically allocate some of these steps to some supporting organizations and partners. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1143.473s">So</a> the second building block or theme is a welcoming and supportive community. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1147.414s">And</a> so, <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1150.264s">One</a> of the big goals here is ensuring affordable housing for all and housing was a big theme that came forth throughout the engagement process. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1158.84s">As</a> Brie mentioned, part of moving this chapter up in the structure of the plan was really to emphasize kind of the weight of that piece within the plan and the emphasis on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1169.765s">And</a> this plan builds a lot on the housing production plan that was recently completed, but really emphasizing that the affordable housing goal is a main component of this plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1182.053s">Another</a> goal within this theme is enlivening open spaces and facilities and really having those Medford's abundant open space, really leveraging that and making it be the most welcoming and supportive and engaging places that they can be. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1198.367s">And</a> then also honoring Medford's rich history, roots and culture that are really present throughout the neighborhoods and how we can bring those to the forefront and think about how to leverage those resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1212.695s">And</a> so highlighting a few examples of actions here, diversifying housing options by allowing multifamily and small diverse housing options through zoning changes, retrofitting existing facilities for universal accessibility, and beautifying centers by working with local artists to highlight history and culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1235.151s">So</a> kind of that mix of addressing affordability and open space and
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1251.708s">And</a> this relates to economic development and land use and open space and how these work together to kind of create a more vibrant and active community. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1263.435s">And</a> a few goals here were something that was heard a lot in engagement was about creating these live and work communities in Bedford and sort of the 12 and 18 hour communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1275.08s">So</a> having something to do and extending the hours of when these resources are available and activities happening in centers. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1285.605s">Also</a> supporting businesses and the workforce. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1288.146s">So</a> through workforce training and making sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1292.193s">economic</a> development growth in Medford supports Medford residents and the members of the community are prepared with the skills and resources for that growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1303.978s">And</a> then increasing the enjoyment of natural resources, also within this by replacement element and balancing growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1311.102s">So</a> really seeing <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1313.033s">you</a> know, the areas that are appropriate for growth and how to balance that with investment in infrastructure and transportation to really make sure that the investments needed are in place to support that growth.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1335.443s">Leveraging</a> city-owned parcels to develop and promote multi-family residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1340.465s">Attracting</a> companies that will provide well-being jobs to residents in Bedford. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1346.086s">And</a> encouraging that small-scale neighborhood retail and services to provide services within neighborhoods and those walkable communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1358.991s">So</a> then the fourth theme or building block here is access for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1363.657s">And</a> this relates to mobility and facilities and services and how people get around the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1369.821s">And</a> so the goals here relate to connecting multi-mobile networks and building on recent investments that have been made and really creating the connections between where people want to go in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1383.429s">As</a> I mentioned a bit with Fiber Police is to coordinating that mobility and development so that where growth is happening, there is the transportation infrastructure to support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1393.848s">And</a> then improving the mobility experience for all users. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1396.929s">So</a> from pedestrians and bikers to transit users and universal accessibility, really making sure that experience is improved for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1411.134s">So</a> a couple of actions that I'll highlight here are auditing pedestrian crossings and school adjacent routes for safe crossings. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1421.054s">working</a> with the ongoing bicycle master plan update to really create a safe and well-connected network for all users, promoting density and mixed use and walking distance of MBTA train stations and major bus hubs, and then also determining how to integrate currently unaccepted streets into the city ownership, since that was a topic that came up a lot in engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1445.398s">And</a> then finally, and we sort of move this to the end, not because it's not important, but because it's sort of looking ahead to the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1454.002s">And</a> also it's building on so much work that the city is already doing with the climate action and adaptation plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1462.785s">And</a> so climate resilience goals within the plan include raising community awareness about the impacts of climate change. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1470.794s">really</a> achieving and evolving the climate action and adaptation plan so that it's time to support implementation of that plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1478.679s">Preserving</a> and enhancing my current existing natural resources to really leverage those existing assets, and then supporting community health and resilience. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1488.844s">So</a> really <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1490.835s">trying</a> to create the resources necessary to support the Metric community and in particular, environmental justice communities or communities who are at greater risk of negative impacts and climate change. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1506.907s">And</a> so a few key examples here of actions to highlight are using streets and open spaces for stormwater management, focusing public tree investments in priority areas like places of high heat vulnerability, <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1520.934s">adopting</a> environmental performance standards for large projects, and updating flood resilience and cool surface design guidelines and standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=1531.062s">So</a> with that, I will turn it over to Emily to talk about our implementation section.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2189.825s">It</a> is. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2190.226s">The</a> only thing that's remaining to be swapped is that order of the chapters and the graphic of the implementation table. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2196.811s">So</a> Alicia, we might leave it up to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2199.693s">If</a> you think the video is final, it just needs that replacement swap out of the implementation page. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2205.937s">And</a> that should happen any day now. <a href="https://youtu.be/oefytL6ycdo&t=2208.286s">We</a> just have it here in case it would be helpful and we can sort of share it around after the fact as well once we have that updated literacy.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5983.923s">going</a> to I mean, I mean, I could also if there's any other councils of which to speak at this time, I think I also will ask for clarity on the motions, but I will wait till the clerk returns. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5999.007s">I</a> just want to affirm what many councils have said. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6002.328s">I</a> agree with vices and bears that I don't think we should add another fossil fuel station, another gas station in the city, period. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6009.247s">Unfortunately,</a> that is not the power we have right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6012.49s">And</a> I very much understand the, and I should say not the power we have, but I mean for the power for that to uphold in core. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6019.375s">And</a> I very much understand what the letter from the neighbors noted that the state's climate action plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6026.281s">Unfortunately,</a> the state puts these things on cities and then doesn't give us the power to enact things that would be powerful movement towards moving away from fossil fuel. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6037.559s">Unfortunately,</a> in this position as Councilors, sometimes we have to make the least bad decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6045.082s">Again,</a> I don't want to permit this. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6047.182s">Unfortunately,</a> we have been basically told by the courts that we get this or we go back to court and we don't address any of the issues that residents have before us, that neighbors have before us that are very valid issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6059.466s">And</a> what I see before us is an opportunity, not the way I would like to address some of those issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6065.643s">Um,</a> again, I want to make sure that I support the Councilors motions to keep this open here. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6071.087s">Additional</a> public comment on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6072.848s">Um,</a> as we do still have a little bit of time, be able to hear additional public comment on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6077.591s">Um,</a> and I'll wait for the clerk to return. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6081.073s">Um,</a> anyone else to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6089.031s">I</a> know I made up. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6092.552s">I</a> was trying to trying to guess based on how how verbose you guys are and I guess wrong.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6099.307s">I</a> figured since you were talking, I figured there was time.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6126.945s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6127.205s">And</a> I think to build off that point, I think part of the reason, again, this extended public comment period, this is a different project, but I think the council permitted a large project in a similar area, in the area in the same neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6140.089s">And</a> there are some issues that have come up with it that I think if we had foreseen those issues, we absolutely would have put conditions on it so that we can do the best for our neighbors, for the abutters. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6148.951s">So</a> I think that's a really important process or the process we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6152.882s">Vice</a> President Bears is about to make a motion.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6187.134s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6187.454s">And</a> I would also seek a motion just explicitly continuing the hearing, keeping the hearing open 31st.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6199.196s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6202.717s">Um,</a> Attorney Austin, would that satisfy? <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6204.937s">Um,</a> what's in front of us tonight?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6263.325s">Yes,</a> if you could, to make sure we don't have anything missed from what was brought up.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6355.165s">Any</a> further discussion at this time? <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6357.306s">I</a> will take the motion to continue first since the other motion is predicated on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6361.99s">So</a> on the motion of Vice President Bears to keep the hearing open until our next regular meeting date on January 31st, seconded by Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6371.057s">Mr.</a> Clerk, do you need a roll call for that? <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6372.218s">Yeah,</a> we'll take a roll call.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6392.552s">Yes.</a>

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6404.501s">And</a> then we have a second motion from vice president bears to compile all the conditions as presented by BJ's the council tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6411.986s">And</a> does that cover it and disseminate to the council?

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=866.848s">We</a> do have Attorney Jeffrey Blake from KP Law on the call right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=871.77s">Would</a> any Councilors like to speak or ask questions before we hear from Attorney Blake?

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1146.049s">So</a> just to understand, and I think this is where it came up in BJ, so we would have to, if it were to be a vote to denial, we would have to cite a specific reason and that we as a body would have to agree upon that specific reason?

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1420.138s">Any</a> further questions from the Council at this time?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1464.966s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1466.247s">Vice</a> Mayor Bears?

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1666.663s">Any</a> further comments from the council at this time? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1668.524s">Director</a> Alicia Hunt.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1765.059s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1768.062s">Any</a> further questions of the council at this time I do have one person embarrassed. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1773.747s">Attorney,</a> Attorney Blake, could you speak to the timeframe so just <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1777.984s">hearing</a> from what councils are saying, if the council were to move to table this again or to a date certain, what timeframe are we looking at that we must approve or deny this?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1832.381s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1832.822s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1939.582s">And</a> I didn't, I'm sorry, Councilor Knight, what was your question earlier? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1942.003s">I</a> didn't catch the first part.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1953.35s">Okay,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1962.716s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1964.257s">So,</a> Attorney Blake, just so I know, <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1967.183s">we're</a> doing this the right way. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1968.083s">If</a> we were to move it to committee with that, we could continue the public hearing in committee or we would need to close it here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1974.766s">That</a> would start the time clock.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2004.345s">Any</a> other my questions that satisfied this time.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2015.53s">We'd</a> like to request a traffic study or
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2055.122s">I</a> think we just don't have the traffic study before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2058.684s">We</a> have the sign off of no anticipated impact, but we don't have the actual report out. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2064.768s">I</a> mean.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2089.777s">You</a> mean for the original permit?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=2109.439s">Well,</a> Attorney Blake did say he believed it's within reason for us to request it, so.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2899.504s">Yeah,</a> would any Councilor like to do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2901.906s">I</a> mean, I'm happy to. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2903.387s">Sure,</a> we'll make sure it's on the next agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2904.888s">So</a> that would be in two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2905.728s">And</a> yep, we can speak to it.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1867.772s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1868.013s">Seven</a> in the affirmative, zero in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1869.194s">The</a> motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1872.725s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1873.385s">22-462</a> to the Honorable President and members of the Metro City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1878.089s">Water</a> meter replacement project funding recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1881.291s">As</a> you may be aware, the current meter system the city uses to measure and record water use is nearing its end of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1886.435s">We</a> plan to replace the existing water meters in the city with new meters that meet the current needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1891.238s">This</a> is a three-year project with a cost of an estimate of $8,500,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1894.661s">The</a> Department of Public Works, DPW, prepared the following information in support of funding the water meter replacement project. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1902.487s">This</a> information summarizes and documents the plan to fund this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1906.57s">The</a> DPW recommends that this be funded from two sources. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1909.753s">The</a> first is the MWRA Tier 2 Local Water Assistance Program, LWSAP, and the second is ARPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1917.218s">The</a> project is eligible for both sources and has been pre-coordinated with the MWRA program. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1921.722s">The</a> MWRA program is typically used for water and sewer capital improvement projects and regulatory compliance programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1927.927s">However,</a> these types of projects are eligible for other funding sources, including but not limited to ARPA and retained earnings. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1933.891s">The</a> following is a recommendation funding breakdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1935.933s">The</a> MWRA loan portion will require an approved loan order from the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1940.476s">The</a> purpose of this memo is to inform you further about the project and begin the process to obtain support from City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1945.3s">$7,800,000</a> borrowed from the MWRA Tier 2 LWSAP program. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1947.942s">This</a> is a 0% loan paid back over 10 years and $700,000 paid from ARPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1957.27s">MWRA</a> local water system assistance program assistance program information. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1962.232s">This</a> program is a 0% interest loan program that has paid off over 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1966.074s">The</a> city currently has phase two and phase three funding available. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1969.555s">Phase</a> two will only be available through the end of 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1971.616s">The</a> tier two portion of this project is a restricted amount of funding within each phase that can be spent on certain types of projects such as meter replacements. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1980.78s">The</a> breakdowns of each phase and available restricted tier two funds are below. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1985.044s">Phase</a> two total available is $3,662,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1986.225s">Phase</a> two tier two available is $2,518,006 of the total. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1987.587s">Phase</a> three total available is $5,400,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1989.368s">Phase</a> three tier three available is $5,370,526 of the total. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2005.424s">Total</a> available for a tier two restricted amount is $7,888,532. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2007.685s">This</a> recommendation includes using most of the phase two tier two available funds leaving $1,143,994 available for other eligible projects and using $5,281,994 from the phase three tier two available funds leaving $88,532 for other eligible projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2032.864s">There</a> are other projects we would typically target MWRA, LWSAP for funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2036.866s">However,</a> they are also eligible for other available sources. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2039.868s">Due</a> to the smaller size of these projects, they're more appropriate for either ARPA retained earnings or remaining funds from MWRA, potentially other sources. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2047.532s">Water</a> and Soil Superintendent Dan Stoneking and Head Meteor Technician Ron Baker will be available to answer questions on this important project. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2053.935s">Thank</a> you for your time and attention to this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2055.496s">Respectfully</a> submitted, Mayor Brianna Leno-Kirk. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2058.918s">President</a> Paris.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=5283.748s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=5284.689s">So</a> this, I'm sure this happened to my fellow Councilors as well I had a number of residents reach out to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=5290.953s">Some</a> good neighbors are spreading the word about this bus redesign project which counts are saying, to his credit, I did bring up a previous motion letting people know about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=5299.86s">It's,</a> you know, not everyone watches the city council meeting so we're just now getting around and one of the main issues that we're hitting against is <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=5306.805s">A</a> lot of elderly people, a lot of people, you know that take the bus may not have access, you know, to a zoom meeting maybe at work during this time and so this is asking that the MBTA hold an in person meeting for those folks impacted in the inner core which is what includes Medford so the MBTA is hosting a number of in person meetings but the vast majority of them are in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=5327.413s">and</a> communities that aren't Medford and communities that aren't actually, I believe, in the inner core. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=5331.617s">So</a> they're leaving a lot of folks out from this decision making. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=5335.4s">So</a> my hope is perhaps we do have someone who has some close contacts at the MBTA, perhaps the city clerk who worked for the MBTA could help us in nudging them to have an in-person meeting so that folks can submit their feedback to this and also <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=5354.768s">I</a> will work my hardest and also again, working with the city clerk so that we can have that committee of the whole as councilor center requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=5360.873s">So</a> also in lieu of a dedicated MBTA meeting, perhaps we can have a committee of the whole where we can have an MBTA representative attend before the comment period is closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=5370.46s">So</a> that would be something we'd be looking at for before or around our summer meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=5375.324s">That</a> way residents can at least attend that in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=5378.486s">We</a> can communicate that feedback through the public comment form. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=5382.009s">I</a> also do just want to note that, again, there is a public comment form if folks aren't aware. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=5386.91s">So</a> if you've already seen the plan and you have thoughts on it, please submit your comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=5391.411s">This</a> is not a done deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=5392.672s">This</a> is a lot of ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=5394.892s">And</a> we want to get feedback from as many residents as possible and get feedback from those folks that are actually using these services who might not be able to attend that Zoom meeting for a variety of reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=5405.915s">So</a> letting them know about the Zoom meeting if they can attend, working with the city clerk to see if we can get <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=5412.076s">the</a> MBTA to host their own meeting, and then also working with the city clerk to see if we can get the MBTA, get an MBTA representative to attend a future Committee of the Whole so that we can solicit feedback from all of our residents that are gonna be impacted by this redesign. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=5426.579s">And</a> I move approval.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=5935.982s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=5936.543s">Just</a> quickly, to Councilor Caraviello's point, we actually, we got a notification, or I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=5941.327s">I</a> don't know how the map is drawn for these things half the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=5944.05s">Got</a> a notification that streets would be closed around City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=5946.712s">Click</a> for more information. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=5947.873s">You</a> click, there's no more information. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=5949.895s">So</a> if we could get a little more thought process behind what we're putting out, I think that would be good for all residents.

href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=970.386s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=971.916s">Pricers</a> and bearers, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=973.816s">All</a> those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=975.097s">Motion</a> passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=975.957s">So</a> 22360. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=976.997s">So</a> what this paper is, it goes just into the efforts of corporations like Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash to keep their employees classified as independent contractors. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=988.18s">And</a> as such, these employees do not get benefits or pay into things like social security. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=993.281s">A</a> lot of times they are not getting a living wage once, or even a minimum wage once the hours and their shifts are calculated <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1002.159s">These</a> companies contend that these folks are independent contractors and not employees, despite the fact that they are required to perform a set number of shifts. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1012.53s">They</a> do have flexibility in scheduling. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1015.753s">They</a> are not allowed to refuse a certain number of rides or they won't be able to be on the app anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1021.915s">So</a> this is in response to House Bill 1234, that would continue to exempt these gay economy businesses from paying into Social Security unemployment, which costs Massachusetts taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars, and we can use these programs for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1035.523s">And</a> it would affirm our support in joining Councilors across the greater Boston region, workers, consumers, community members, faith organizations, environmental and racial justice advocates, labor rights, civil rights, and union organizers to urge Massachusetts legislature to oppose House Bill 1234, <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1051.403s">and</a> the proposed 2022 state ballot initiative with similar language. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1055.924s">So</a> this is just really something to affirm our support. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1058.945s">I</a> understand Councilors, you know, certain times don't like to go on issues that go up to the state level in this way, but I would just argue that this is something that very much impacts our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1070.149s">These</a> are people who live in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1072.209s">These</a> are workers that are <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1074.953s">As</a> I said, oftentimes not making a living wage they're not making a minimum wage. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1078.959s">And</a> these are services that use our roads our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1083.326s">And</a> we talked about the congestion and the dangerousness that happens because of all these services, and they're essentially. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1090.417s">they're</a> allowed to do whatever they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1091.658s">They</a> say these people aren't employees, we're not going to give them benefits, we're not going to make sure they have a living wage, and they want to codify that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1097.582s">So</a> this is just asking the council to join with other councils and leaders in the area to stand up and say that these workers deserve the same rights as all other employees, because that's what they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1109.069s">Vice</a> President Bears, Councilor Caraviello, Collin Sands, go around. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1113.532s">Vice</a> President Bears first.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5129.364s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5130.224s">Any</a> further discussion from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5134.067s">Just</a> as a member of the council I'm just going to speak from the chair as I've been relatively quiet on this just trying to manage debate but I, I support this because I do believe this reflects this the format of how work gets done in this council as Councilor Knight has spoken. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5145.558s">I</a> understand the concerns of my fellow Councilors they're absolutely heated they're heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5150.523s">You</a> know, to counter Carlos point I understand along meetings but you know right now sometimes we'll have a meeting that starts at five we start with the committee the whole, and then we keep going so we're in meetings four or five hours even if we're not going late you've been meeting for a long time so allowing for, you know, more freedom with those meetings to to get the work done and not have things kind of running into each other as we did, did tonight and I think also. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5171.806s">The</a> Committee of the whole the subcommittee structure does allow for for more voices to be heard for different voices because there are a lot of folks that are focused on a single issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5180.054s">And</a> they might not come to a council meeting, they might not have the time for that, but they're at that subcommittee they're at that committee the whole you can look back on recent meetings on different topics and <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5188.32s">there's</a> a lot of dialogue and there's a lot of folks that you might not see in a regular meeting, but will come out to that meeting and they will speak about their single issue, whether it's curb appeal or relief blowers or food trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5200.242s">So</a> this is why it has my support. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5202.643s">I</a> absolutely do believe that this will facilitate the council to do the work that it does best and that it's statutory work. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5209.204s">So</a> it's ordinances, it's policy, it's reviewing the budget, which we do in communities as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5215.883s">and</a> just getting that work done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5217.383s">So</a> this has my support and I just wanted to say that just to go on record and share that as I have been fairly quiet, just managing to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5224.846s">Any</a> further discussion from my fellow councilors? <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5226.686s">I</a> know we do have members of the public who would like to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5231.148s">Name</a> and address for the record, please.

<a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=1619.892s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=1622.032s">Just,</a> I do have one letter to read into the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=1624.493s">I</a> don't see anyone who wants to speak in person, seeing on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=1630.294s">I</a> do just have one letter from a resident to read into the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=1635.075s">This</a> is from Luke Prisner at 144th Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=1638.336s">Dear</a> city councilors, I address you this evening to ask for unanimous support for Medford High School's application to the state's School Building Assistant Program via Statement of Interest, SOI. <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=1647.923s">Today's</a> vote is about SOI priorities and community unity. <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=1651.326s">It</a> should not be confused with other subjects such as tax levies or project specifics, neither of those is in play as a result of this vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=1658.151s">Instead,</a> the district working on behalf of thousands of Medford parents and residents ask each of you to endorse the priorities they've selected to highlight before the MSBA Board of Directors. <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=1667.605s">Medford's</a> application will be one among probably 100 such applications to the MSBA this year, out of which only about a 10th are selected into the MSBA program. <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=1677.228s">Therefore,</a> it's very important to show the MSBA that we in Medford are all united in this cause. <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=1682.47s">The</a> high school is now over 50 years old and fixing all of its problems on our own falls far beyond the current needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=1689.212s">We</a> need MSBA's help. <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=1690.673s">MSBA</a> can only help school districts that compellingly state the case for need and urgency and are admitted into the MSBA program. <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=1697.902s">Selection</a> is a game changer and may put Medford on a structured path in a several years long process to resolve our high school's woes, perhaps even in time for the graduating class of 2029. <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=1706.508s">The</a> current SOI is Medford's third in the past five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=1710.491s">It</a> is normal and common for a district to apply multiple times, making refinements along the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=1716.055s">In</a> 2018 the City Council endorsed the district's SOI priorities, but unfortunately the MSBA did not select Medford that year. <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=1723.139s">Then</a> again in 2019 this process repeated the City Council support for SOI priorities, but the outcome was the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=1729.282s">In</a> between then and now the COVID-19 pandemic began disrupting normal activities starting in 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=1734.602s">Now</a> in 2022, normal activities are resuming and the acuity of Medford High's need and urgency has grown. <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=1741.684s">As</a> a community, we must act together and act quickly to re-engage on the SOI process. <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=1745.764s">It's</a> the first step. <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=1747.025s">No</a> money is committed and no decisions are made apart from the decision to ask the MSBA for support. <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=1754.166s">That</a> is the real purpose of today's vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=1755.787s">Namely,</a> do each of you agree that Medford High School needs either rehabilitation or renovation? <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=1760.568s">If</a> you do, then please vote yay. <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=1762.55s">Many</a> residents I've spoken with believe it is time, and we all hope you agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=1766.354s">Medford</a> High School's condition has not improved over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=1768.837s">In</a> many ways, the burdens on its old bones have increased, and the urgency with which we must act has never been greater. <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=1775.184s">I</a> thank you for your thoughtful consideration on this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=1777.527s">Please</a> unanimously endorse the district's SOI priorities today. <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=1780.611s">Best</a> regards, Luke. <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=1784.047s">Anyone</a> else like to speak on the motion of Councilor Caraviello second by second bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/9SFAP6mTapI&t=1792.754s">Mr.</a> Clerk, please call the role.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5004.05s">Yes,</a> deferments can be applied for beyond one year, and then also just going to the penalties and fines for violation. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5010.212s">The</a> ordinance shall be enforced by the health department or its designees. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5013.153s">Whoever</a> violates any provision of this ordinance may be penalized by a non-criminal disposition process as <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5020.015s">provided</a> in general laws chapter 40 section 21 D.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1912.598s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=1913.458s">Vice</a> President Bears.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2087.333s">Thank</a> you, Vice President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2088.233s">And</a> then actually, if I could just read the update from Planning, Development, and Sustainability, that might just be helpful to any questions that come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2094.395s">But</a> of course, everyone is still welcome to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2097.256s">So</a> this is from Alicia Hunt, who is the Director of Planning, Development, and Sustainability. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2102.198s">And</a> some of this is coming verbatim from the person who purchased the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2105.719s">So</a> if this is incorrect, I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2107.84s">This</a> is just the story that they are getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2110.341s">So</a> it's a 34-unit building. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2112.885s">So</a> the director of planning development sustainability and the housing planner spoke with the owner and some of his representatives this past Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2119.851s">So</a> it's a 34 unit building and the owner let them know that 18 units for tenants at will, 14 have leases until the fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2127.59s">The</a> new owner purchased the building one year ago in March 2021, and he said that all units that are tenants at will were in that status when he purchased the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2136.96s">It's</a> clear that his plan is to renovate kitchens, bathrooms, and redo floors, and that the tenants must vacate the apartments for this to occur as they are one-bathroom units. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2144.808s">It</a> was clear that rent would go up after the renovations. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2147.691s">He</a> agreed to extend the notice for the tenants at will an additional 30 days for those who needed an extension. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2153.217s">His</a> representative, Jay Walsh, contacted the department on Friday night to let them know that everyone who had received a notice to quit had been notified that they could have an additional 30 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2164.225s">The</a> director with the city requested that the owner give the tenants with leases as much notice as possible as it's necessary to look for now. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2172.248s">New</a> rental units in September, given this market, look sorry, look now for rental units in September, given the market. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2179.736s">The</a> owner indicated that he understood and would take into advisement and give more notice that he had been planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2186.102s">The</a> city director requested that he give the tenants the opportunity to stay in the building, potentially by giving them the option to return to the renovated apartment. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2194.249s">This</a> seems to be a new idea to him, but he seemed to think it was very reasonable and suggested that once some apartments were renovated, those with longer leases could be offered the option to lease one of the renovated apartments rather than being required to move out. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2207.459s">we</a> emphasize, the city emphasized that we very much would like to retain Medford residents in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2212.222s">And</a> I will make sure you guys get this. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2213.483s">There's</a> just like two more paragraphs. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2216.045s">The</a> city also presented him with information from the Medford Housing Authority on their opportunity for landlords to receive $1,000 for leasing a unit to a section eight voucher holder that hadn't previously leased to someone with section eight and let them know that the maximum section eight rents are what the maximum section eight rents are in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2234.094s">It's</a> the city director's hope that he would consider Section 8 voucher holders for the renovated units. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2239.017s">The</a> current Section 8 tenants are through the Arlington Housing Authority, and the landlord has been in touch with them to verify that everything that they did was legal. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2246.982s">The</a> city director did not ask him about current or future rent rates, as they were focused on keeping Medford residents housed at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2254.127s">And</a> they just went out to note that they did flyer every door in the building with the flyers with regard to ABCD and the move in, move out program. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2262.557s">Um,</a> if anyone didn't get that information, we can make sure that that gets to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2266.219s">Um,</a> so any further questions we can relate to them and as fellow council just said, we, as a, we, as a body don't have any statutory power, but we can absolutely advocate. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2276.222s">We</a> can reach out to, you know, the city departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2278.863s">I</a> put in a call to Senator Jalen to see if there's anything that, you know, we may not be thinking of that can be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2284.105s">So</a> I think even though we don't have direct power in this situation, <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2288.607s">As</a> fellow Councilors said, you know, my heart breaks for you guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2290.888s">This</a> is obviously also this is the tip of the iceberg, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2293.228s">Like,</a> this is stuff that we've been trying to stave off for the past two years and the housing market being what it is, we're unfortunately going to keep, you know, this is going to keep happening to our residents and it's not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2306.462s">we'll</a> do what we can to stop it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2308.283s">But</a> unfortunately, we don't have a lot of power in this situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2310.645s">But</a> thank you for bearing with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2313.566s">Please</a> just name and address. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2316.068s">I</a> mean, we know the address, but name and address for the record, please.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=775.557s">Councilor-</a> Yes, thank you for that clarification.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_s4ePTNAg4Nw/2024-11-19_s4ePTNAg4Nw.html">City Council 02-08-22</a></h2>
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1200.302s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, yeah and I will be brief because as Councilor Scarpelli or someone already noted there's a lot of people here who want to speak on this but I mean, I'm in favor of this I'm also in favor of you know getting that stronger vote I understand that some Councilors have their concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1214.925s">I</a> voted for this in the past I will vote for it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1217.866s">If</a> nothing else in the fact that this is step one in a review of a document that has not been reviewed in the lifetime of the most. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1224.967s">of</a> almost half of this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1226.528s">I'm</a> just on the edge. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1227.408s">It</a> has been reviewed in my lifetime by a year, but most of the council are, you know, three members of the council, we have not looked at this document in their lifetime. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1235.911s">So</a> I think it's just prudent that it's something that is reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1238.492s">And</a> I think we've seen a lot of good work out of commissions in the city as of late. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1242.553s">And</a> I think this is something that could have further good work done on it, but I'm also open to getting to that stronger vote so that hopefully the state house can act on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1251.676s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3041.598s">Thank</a> you as I want to thank Councilor Knight my fellow environmentalist for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3046.679s">As</a> he said this isn't just about pests, it's also about groundwater and aquaculture that can be really impacted by road salt so I also, you know, I don't have too much faith that we're using. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3057.281s">It's</a> very tricky to get salt that doesn't harm our pets and aquaculture but I think having that information is helpful so I support this motion, I appreciate him bringing it forward.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3246.584s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, yeah this is pretty self explanatory I had a few residents reach out to me with some confusion about the most recent storm as far as parking procedures I do know that the city goes through great effort with our reverse 911 to put out calls about snow emergencies there is information on the website but people moving from other communities that do have signage around this. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3268.057s">Sometimes</a> they're at a loss they don't see signs saying they can't park on the side of their street and then their car is gone so I know other communities Somerville specifically puts out some temporary signage simple yard signs around the city indicating what side of the street to park on if your street is under a snow emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3283.799s">I</a> know we've had success in our city with simple signage as far as around elections information that we haven't done in the past so just see if this is something the administration will consider so that we can reach those residents who might not know how to get city alerts, they might be new to the city and not understand city policies and they would like to not have their car, remove surprisingly during a snowstorm so I move approval.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3380.778s">Mr.</a> President, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3383.63s">I'm</a> just the thought I mean, I think in Somerville it's literally, you know, they'll have a yard sign, like a lawn sign and like a rotary, you know, a city owned property that just indicates, it's just a suggestion for the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3394.893s">There</a> are you know I did, I did hear from people that somehow they don't, they don't, the information did not reach them, their car was towed, something you know we could look into potentially.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4203.302s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4204.622s">Since</a> I submitted this encore has since walked back their proposal for this entertainment venue they are looking at a less than 1000 seat venue. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4213.525s">But</a> as since Councilor Caraviello brought this forward to the, I believe Councilor Caraviello or he's been doing work on this brought this forward to the council encore has changed their plans a number of times so I do think there is still merit to sending a letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4227.649s">resident</a> Ken Krause who's also been working on this mentioned that we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4231.671s">He</a> supports us coming out and just basically stating that the city of Medford or the council rather is against when presenting live entertainment anywhere within its gaming establishment unless they're under 1000 seats or over 300 3500 seats. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4247.621s">And</a> again, the reason for this is this would be anything outside of this would be in direct violation of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4256.065s">surrounding</a> community agreement that was entered into so just stating as a council and going in line with the administration who sent a similar letter that we are against any proposed entertainment venue that would violate the terms that we that were agreed to many years ago as far as the number of seats and would do harm to local smaller venues such as the Chevalier.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5658.564s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, I understand the intention of this I am with the other councils I'm not having a separate committee the whole simply because the zoning meeting the committee the whole tomorrow is to review the, the CD boards recommendations and since this is outside of it doesn't feel like we have the proper. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5673.451s">I'm</a> sorry, agenda like agenda notice time for such a topic that would be my opinion on this so like other issues tonight I just want to make sure we're doing this the right way so we don't get caught not being able to do what we're intending to do here.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6524.01s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6524.651s">I</a> do see Eric von Berg has his hand up as well on zoom, I can unmute him.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8012.877s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8015.748s">I</a> do see Chief of Staff Nazarian has her hand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8018.29s">I</a> don't know if that would be helpful.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8110.885s">I'm</a> gonna note that I'm going to vote yes for this just because this is a paper that was brought forward by the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8116.768s">And</a> since they're noting their own willingness and desire to take a beat to review this, I think that that makes sense if that is their wish and they are the folks who delivered this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8132.218s">So</a> that's my reason for voting yes for this.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8159.195s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8164.797s">Councilor</a> Knight could use his microphone.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8314.59s">Councilor</a> Caraviello could use his microphone.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8365.721s">Mr.</a> President, if I can move for reconsideration.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8532.279s">He</a> did ask that just procedurally this is a question for the clerks for them to present, be able to speak next week as this doesn't have a paper number when he just need to resubmit or could this be tabled.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8567.526s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8567.786s">Yeah,</a> Mr. Petrella asked just that it be on for next week if the clerk is so obliged to leave that on.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8600.876s">I,</a> we had a date and then we could only get a Tuesday date from the Department of Transportation so let me follow up because that your recommendation, a Wednesday day to allow more open ended so I'll follow up first thing we could do any Monday, Tuesday, Monday or Thursday if you need to.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_OV8H6CfzDMQ/2024-11-19_OV8H6CfzDMQ.html">City Council 02-01-22</a></h2>

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1648.476s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, yeah I just want to note that for those watching who maybe weren't at our meeting on Wednesday we didn't have a meeting on Wednesday on each of these projects with a great overview on all of them and again I also wholeheartedly support them I think it's a great mix of projects and we did get word from. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1664.807s">I'm</a> friends with the CPC that there are other projects that will be forthcoming that they are still reviewing based on the amount of projects that came in and the amount of funding that is available. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1673.254s">So</a> I just want to note that there will be more coming because I know if people have been attending those meetings, there's many other very worthy projects and I look forward to those coming before this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1682.442s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_cxtnrZly_dE/2024-11-19_cxtnrZly_dE.html">City Council 01-18-22</a></h2>

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1327.419s">I</a> mean I can ask them separately I don't I. Yeah, I'm fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1331.762s">I</a> can ask them separately. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1333.664s">Oh,</a> I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1336.526s">I'm.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1338.708s">It's</a> a little loss of resume I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1340.789s">So</a> yeah, so the, the number for the gender equity commission is 19-312.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1382.845s">Yeah,</a> if I could, Councilor Caraviello, <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1386.192s">And</a> I absolutely hear what you're saying, Councilor Scarpella, and I think that's valid, and those are conversations that need to be had. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1391.215s">I</a> just don't want to, I think Councilor, Vice President Bears has the same concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1394.777s">I</a> don't want to inhibit, somehow inhibit ourselves from being able to form the subcommittees, particularly if we're sending things to rules right now, get stuck in kind of a catch-22 where we can't have that rules subcommittee because we're trying to hold for this committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1408.786s">So</a> I'm curious if the language, if you would be satisfied the language were clarified, that this is something we'll <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1415.762s">you</a> know, have a meeting about down the road, but it doesn't inhibit the president from forming subcommittees, you know, in the interim.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9201.687s">Um,</a> yeah, thank you, Vice President Bears I want to echo what Councilor Collins said I understand, you know, the, the concerns of the council I have the same concerns I absolutely would like to see this as an assistant city solicitor position and build up that institutional knowledge and, you know, have that office at a staffing level it's historically had. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9222.204s">But</a> with that said, I don't want to interrupt service and the support that's being provided to the city solicitor at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9228.348s">Um,</a> you know, I'm definitely conflicted and I would like to see at the budget that as Councilor Collins said, really considering the assistant city solicitor position so that we're not at this crossroads where our hands are, um, in some way tied where I don't want to remove support from solicitor Scanlon and all the work she has before her. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9246.155s">Um,</a> but I, I'd love to see it not done by KP law. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9250.277s">Um,</a> so that's all I have for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9252.598s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9843.827s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9844.207s">If</a> I could, through the chair, just Chief of Staff Nazarian, do we know when we're expecting results from that classification study? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9852.612s">I'm</a> sure I've asked this before. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9855.374s">I</a> apologize.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10913.996s">Mr.</a> Vice President, motion to take 21-631 off the table for its third reading.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11125.822s">Mr.</a> Vice President, also motion to take 21-631 <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11132.235s">the</a> third one that was tabled, which includes amendments FIJ and parts of amendments L and M off the table and move for approval for first reading.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11465.616s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11466.737s">Just</a> to reiterate the point that this is about the CAF approval, not appropriation. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11470.82s">And</a> I do believe there is some debate whether <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11474.494s">positions</a> of this, you know that I know it's not grant funding it's a special funding from the federal government whether they even need calf approval so I appreciate the count, the administration coming forward for the approval of these positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11487.123s">And</a> again, it's a proof of the calf not an appropriation approval point of information, Councilor scarpelli.<h2><a href="../2022-01-03_XXXXXX00018/2022-01-03_XXXXXX00018.html">Reimagym Your New Year</a></h2>
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=19.27s">Nicole</a> Morell, Medford City Councilor. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=26.851s">The</a> first guiding question you have is what am I proud of from this year? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=30.732s">And</a> I think what I'm most proud of is really <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=33.54s">fighting</a> for issues that matter to me and matter to residents, even though it may have been clear that we didn't have the votes to get that issue through. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=42.146s">So</a> one example is fighting to give ABCD the full funding they requested through their CPA request as far as funding the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=53.335s">emergency</a> rental assistance program for those facing housing insecurity in Medford as a result of the pandemic. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=59.619s">This</a> was something that other Councilors really wanted to kind of chunk this money up and make ABCD come back to us, you know, every few months asking for more money, asking for more money as part of that full request. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=71.266s">And,</a> you know, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=72.643s">For</a> me, seeing the dire situation we were in and are still in, it made the most sense to just get that money to ABCD, help them facilitate the programs and support residents without adding additional bureaucracy. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=84.45s">So</a> that's something I fought for when it came time for the budget. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=89.444s">pushing</a> for an increase in the tree budget, which the mayor responded to and increase the budget there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=95.446s">And</a> then also advocating for increased pay for the diversity director position. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=99.167s">So</a> these positions got separated out. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=101.448s">We</a> now have the chief people officer and the diversity director position. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=105.49s">And</a> I saw in the budget that the diversity director position was the lowest paid, one of the lowest paid, if not the lowest paid, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=113.035s">directors</a> in the budget. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=114.476s">And</a> I advocated for an increase in the salary of that because we can't say we value something and then underfund it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=120.299s">Particularly</a> this time, diversity and inclusion officers are incredibly in demand. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=125.621s">And</a> if we actually value this in Medford, we need to pay those positions and demonstrate that, live our values. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=132.465s">And</a> I attract people that have top talent doing this work who really want to do great work in Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=139.706s">I</a> also push for monthly updates and information on Medford's fight against the coronavirus and really advocating for sustainability and transportation and walkability issues wherever I could. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=153.813s">So</a> any project that came before us, whether it was a zoning recodification or there was another large project regarding the old Whole Foods Bakery, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=161.77s">saying</a> what are we doing for sustainability? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=163.691s">What</a> are we doing for making sure this is pedestrian friendly? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=167.214s">How</a> are we getting bike lanes out of this? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=169.276s">How</a> are we getting protected bus stops out of this? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=173.619s">And</a> just really seeing every time something came before us, trying to view it through the lens of sustainability, through the lens of a multimodal Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=182.065s">So</a> another issue you talked about is inclusivity. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=185.188s">So</a> when I think about inclusivity, I think about speaking and being heard and represented in the chambers specifically. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=191.652s">as</a> that's where, you know, my job requires me to spend a lot of my time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=195.335s">And</a> as we look at the new term with two new Councilors, I'm really excited about the voices that will join us officially behind the rail. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=201.26s">So</a> Manfred's first Asian American Councilors serve and a vast increase with, sorry, a vast increase with a renter representation through both Councilors, both new Councilors, as well as different neighborhoods having that South Manfred representation and also having that experience growing up in Wellington. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=219.956s">but</a> also what this means for residents. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=221.837s">So</a> I'm hoping that this new term offers a much more welcoming space for people to attend when safe to do so, offer their insight and share their unique lived experience. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=231.225s">So</a> the chambers and the procedures of meetings can be intimidating. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=235.589s">And</a> I'm hoping that's something that we can change in this new term as a new council. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=240.773s">And</a> I really want us to operate in the way of nothing about us without us. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=244.977s">I</a> mean, we've seen <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=246.63s">recently</a> how that's happened. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=248.771s">Decisions</a> being made at different levels with, you know, decisions about people, decisions that affect people, and not having those people in the room or part of the process or offering insight to make sure we're doing things right and make sure we're not harming people in the process. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=266.579s">Another</a> topic you mentioned is charter review. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=268.981s">I</a> remain hopeful for charter review. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=270.541s">This</a> goes back in my mind to inclusivity and representation. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=273.883s">I</a> see, and I'm really excited to see more folks mobilizing around this. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=278.566s">And</a> I know that it has my support and I'll do everything in my power to see that we get a strong vote on this through the council. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=285.669s">You</a> know, what are other Councilors looking for? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=288.171s">What</a> concerns do they need to have addressed to get a yes vote on this? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=293.053s">as</a> we've seen time and time again as this comes before the council, demonstrating that strong support from the council has an impact on what the statehouse decides. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=302.479s">So</a> we want this vote to get to them and have, you know, as strong a vote as we can to say this is something <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=308.662s">that</a> the people of Medford want. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=310.445s">This</a> is something that is just simply long overdue. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=313.268s">I</a> mean, it's just good politics. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=315.171s">It's</a> just good policy to review an operating document that has been unchanged for decades at this point, when the city has vastly changed. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=325.362s">And</a> priorities for next term. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=327.225s">My</a> biggest priorities, you know, as I said before, the lens I view things through is sustainability and transportation and I view these as two sides of the same coin. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=337.018s">So</a> a more sustainable Medford is a Medford that we have less emissions and less fossil fuels. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=343.763s">and</a> less traffic or more ways to get around. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=346.504s">So</a> doing everything I can to support bike lanes and multimodal streets and public transportation and making public transportation easier to take, which, you know, advocating for increased bus service or just the return to the bus service we once had, doing everything we can to make sure that everyone in the city <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=365.208s">has</a> safe pathways to get to the new Green Line extension, they can use that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=371.252s">Improving</a> our streets and sidewalks, improving our sidewalks so that people with strollers and wheelchairs and mobility devices can use the sidewalk because <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=382.25s">parking</a> and traffic enforcement so there's not cars blocking the sidewalk or bike lane so that people, regardless of their dependence on vehicles and I know you know different life circumstances require you know different transportation needs but those who <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=396.376s">can</a> not, you know, can avoid using a car, can avoid adding to those emissions, can get around Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=402.581s">And</a> there's things to do around Medford on foot. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=405.424s">So</a> really just supporting a more sustainable Medford in the sense of climate change or in the sense of individual sustainability, making it a sustainable place for families to live and people without cars and people who can't drive, people who are too young to drive to get around the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=419.376s">So</a> really trying to view everything from the budget to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=424.915s">zoning</a> changes to ordinances through that lens of how do we make Medford more sustainable and more multimodal. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=432.223s">I</a> think a lot of stuff comes from that and hearing from more people and hearing from people who have different experiences with traveling throughout the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=440.373s">Yeah,</a> that's all I have. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ynnc7J72cuzCa0uptGpny?t=443.596s">Thanks</a> so much.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_kp64eg_WEKE/2024-11-19_kp64eg_WEKE.html">City Council 12-21-21</a></h2>

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7929.667s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7931.108s">Councilor</a> Marks, I mean, it's no secret that we don't always agree, but I have always truly respected just the amount of homework you do before every meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7940.995s">And</a> I can see it on the papers next to you, the amount of preparation you come <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7945.564s">to</a> meetings with and ready to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7947.525s">And</a> I don't think a meeting has gone by where you haven't asked a question or raised a point that's made me kind of rethink or reframe how I'm thinking about a topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7956.807s">It</a> may not totally change my vote, but it absolutely provides a perspective that I didn't think of and is so needed and so welcome in these meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7965.169s">As</a> someone who perhaps my signature is my brevity, I am truly impressed and amazed at your ability to speak at length on topics <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7972.935s">and</a> not repeat yourself, it's truly, it's unlike anything else anyone else can do, and it's very impressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7979.899s">And</a> really, in the two years we've worked together, you've never phoned it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7985.363s">I</a> think even at 11 p.m., which maybe sometimes some of us would like you to phone it in, if it was an issue that you were passionate about, that residents cared about, you were ready to fight, and you were ready to speak your piece on it, and that's absolutely admirable. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7999.231s">And</a> as Councilor Scarpelli just said, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=8003.141s">door</a> knocking campaigning talking to residents around the city I've met many many members of your fan club people who are very appreciative of the work you do, and you as an individual and you leaving the council, you're going to be deeply missed by the community and I thank you as others have said for for challenging me challenging me to be a better Councilor and know just, I have to come to every meeting and be on my toes because of you and I thank you for that and your service to the city for so long.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_LV3E3edqaKU/2024-11-19_LV3E3edqaKU.html">City Council 12-14-21</a></h2>

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=992.442s">I</a> mean, I think you just addressed this, but the question is, you know, if we find that there are, this is not up to snuff, is it going to be a full pass again, or is it going to be piecemeal work already?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=1128.694s">And</a> it's your position that's the final decider as far as it being accepted or not?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=1136.329s">Okay,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=3902.959s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=3952.689s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=3954.952s">Yeah,</a> of course, let Councilor Falco speak I'm sure he has to want to extrapolate this on this more but I mean this is something I understand that the blasting company received a permit for two months worth of blasting, and I believe it began on August 31, so we are pretty much at that two month point. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=3972.51s">I'd</a> like an update on how much longer they're going to be blasting, how the weather impacts this. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=3977.953s">We're</a> talking about the end of construction season. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=3979.954s">Is</a> it the end of blasting season? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=3981.354s">Is</a> this something that's going to pick up again in the spring? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=3983.475s">I</a> think residents are feeling this and hearing this much farther than they anticipated. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=3990.159s">I</a> think partly because, and I live right over here, the neighborhoods are on a lot of ledge and they're essentially on the same ledge that's being blasted <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=3999.543s">you</a> know, a quarter of a mile away. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4001.204s">So</a> there's this, you know, conduction that's getting to people's houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4004.885s">And</a> I think some people are starting to see issues that may not have done the insurance assessment because they thought they were far enough out. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4012.047s">So</a> in addition to getting an update on, you know, how long is this blasting going to continue? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4017.067s">I'd</a> like to know what avenues residents have who are being impacted by this, who did not expect to be impacted by it, and what it's doing to their homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4026.952s">Additionally,</a> I just, it's an unnerving situation, I think, for a lot of people in the area, because some days there's no blasting, some days there's one blast, some days there's two blasts, and it impacts people in different living situations in different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4040.718s">So</a> I'd really like to get an update <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4042.619s">and</a> have, you know, have this information be open to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4046.061s">I</a> mean, the fact that residents have to chase down this information when they're, you know, yards feet away from this massive blasting project, it's not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4056.626s">And</a> the fact that they have to chase us down and then we chase people down to try to get these answers is kind of ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4063.089s">So</a> I'd really like to see an update on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4064.869s">And</a> I pass on to Councilor Falco if you'd like to add.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4620.251s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4621.032s">And</a> you bring up an excellent point of just trying to navigate that area, particularly when people are trying to get to high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4626.255s">It's</a> completely crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4628.237s">You</a> have to get through three work crews. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4630.459s">A</a> lot of times in the morning, the work crew that does the blasting lines up on Winthrop Street near the cemetery, completely blocking viewpoints. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4637.704s">It's</a> absolute chaos in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4639.605s">And</a> I think to Vice President Knight's point, this has been going on for so long, and neighbors were pushing back against it for so long, and then it kind of went quiet. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4647.451s">And</a> then all of a sudden we get an email that blasting starts next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4650.494s">And</a> I think that's why a lot of neighbors were caught off guard and maybe did not have the insurance assessment or have done what they needed to get done beforehand to protect them in this situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4659.963s">So</a> that's what I really want answers on is what kind of recourse do residents have that are being impacted by this, that thought that they were far enough away that they wouldn't be impacted by this. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4670.912s">Yeah,</a> I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4671.493s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4977.743s">It's</a> not confirmed, which I think is something residents continue to look for, understandably so. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4982.426s">And</a> they, you know, email after email kind of get this understandably, you know, mixed messaging about what's actually going to happen.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5029.449s">Perfect,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5031.74s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, just one last point is I do sincerely hope it would be great to have the company there to confirm that it's, you know, only 20 more blasts because you drive by that project. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5041.429s">It's</a> hard to believe it's only 20 more blasts for them to put 10 houses in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5045.693s">So,</a> and to Councilor bears point. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5048.215s">Right</a> now you get a text message a couple hours before a blast. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5051.177s">You</a> don't know if it's a two blast day, a no blast day, a one blast day. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5054.78s">And</a> you know, that's really unnerving for a lot of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5057.682s">So</a> I would love to see a schedule, but right now, you know, it's a couple hours notification and that's, you know, it doesn't work for a lot of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5065.567s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5236.746s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5243.491s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6749.522s">I</a> mean, it hasn't been disbanded, it just hasn't been meeting.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6758.407s">I</a> think that the task is complete, but I think the committee is still active in the sense that it can be engaged whenever needed.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1980.823s">Thank</a> you, Vice President, and I want to thank you all for coming out here. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1984.845s">When</a> my dog wants to walk that far, I walk down there, I'm forcing the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1987.766s">It's</a> the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1988.346s">I'm</a> very familiar with the issues that go on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=1991.267s">And</a> you would think that because it's so close to the school, because kids are walking, they're biking, people are taking their kids down the street, that it would have priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2000.03s">Unfortunately,</a> we haven't seen that yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2002.19s">I</a> think Councilor Scarpelli's resolution is a great idea because what these meetings have allowed us to do, you guys presented so many great ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2010.213s">You</a> can be there in real time with the traffic engineer and they can say here's what's feasible here's what's not from a ADA point standpoint from an engineering standpoint from a funding standpoint, and we were able to leave with some concrete solutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2023.125s">The</a> last time we did this so I know it's not an immediate fix, but hopefully we can schedule that very soon because <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2030.305s">we're</a> able to leave with actual action items that we can follow up on. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2034.689s">Because</a> otherwise, like you said, we can vote tonight, we can end up on an email chain, we can end up on a paper trail, and we can end up with nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2042.355s">So</a> at least if we have that meeting, we can have those conversations and have those concrete steps, because there's no denying it's a serious issue there. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2050.042s">It's</a> just a matter of how fast we're gonna act on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2052.344s">So</a> thank you all for coming out.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=439.445s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=440.045s">And</a> vice president, I just alluded that, um, the illumination would be different. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=445.187s">It</a> would actually be lower and less disruptive with the led, the digital billboard, as opposed to the current illuminated one. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=450.708s">Can</a> you, is that correct?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=483.539s">Do</a> you know how close this is to the other digital billboard? <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=485.941s">I</a> don't know.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=499.102s">Okay,</a> that's all I have right now.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3353.353s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3354.253s">Yeah,</a> this is something we discussed in April of 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3356.674s">The</a> council voted to raise this to $50,000 per year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3361.216s">So</a> this is a state program that the city engages in, and the city council has the ability to set the maximum income cap for people who can participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3370.579s">And</a> it can be raised up to the senior circuit breaker number, which is adjusted every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3377.561s">When</a> we discussed this back in April of 2020, <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3381.682s">We're</a> you know the council is rightfully concerned to see what we're going to get as far as real estate receipts and didn't want to raise this too high. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3387.824s">I</a> believe Councilor Vice President Knight brought up the idea of just automatically tying it to the senior circuit breaker so we don't have to revisit this every so often as the state already adjusts that number reflective of cost of living. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3400.467s">This</a> is a program that not a lot of people participate in, but for some people it is, you know, a lifesaver, a game changer program. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3407.253s">So</a> I would just want to see that it be opened up to as many residents as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3411.717s">But</a> I mean, we're still talking single digits, I believe, as far as people who participate in the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3417.402s">I</a> did ask Ellen for an updated number on number of participants. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3421.225s">I</a> don't have that number just yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3423.666s">We</a> do have time. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3424.547s">I</a> believe this has to be set by April for the fiscal year 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3428.93s">So</a> if my fellow Councilors would like to see this as a committee of the whole, I'm more than happy to move it there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3435.194s">But</a> I think this is just a smart way to approach this program and then have it match that level set by the state.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4535.878s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4536.458s">I</a> just want to reiterate my point that this is a state program. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4539.88s">I</a> agree with what everyone said about just using all the tools in our toolbox. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4542.802s">It's</a> something that's easy for us to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4544.803s">It's</a> something we talked about revisiting, you know, a year and a half ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4548.725s">It's</a> something that Housing Medford, I believe, first came to the council about, like, three years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4554.248s">So</a> that's all I'm advocating for. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4556.549s">And</a> I hope my colleagues will agree to send this to the committee to further discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4562.573s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=219.104s">If</a> I could just go on record as just noting that I think using this body as a forum for civil and legal matters that are ongoing that the council has no jurisdiction over and no involvement with only further confuses the public about the duties of this actual body, which are clearly stated in the city charter, Massachusetts general laws and the open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=240.419s">So</a> I just want to go on record as saying that.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=248.932s">I</a> just want to go on record. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=249.933s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=250.314s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4631.459s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, I think Councilor Marks and Councilor Bears bring up a really good point in that the intention of this art was to drive conversation that didn't happen in the way envisioned because of the vandalism, but there was multiple other opportunities there was a missed opportunity as far as promoting there was a missed opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4649.407s">as</a> far as sharing what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4651.189s">These</a> are opportunities for conversation and for dialogue and to do better. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4655.152s">And</a> if it weren't for a receptive council, how would we hear about this? <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4659.436s">So</a> I think Councilor Bears brings up a really good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4661.677s">Councilor</a> Marks brings up a really good point and we're having this conversation now, but the conversation was intended to be had by the public, by the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4670.204s">We</a> get the pulpit every Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4672.306s">We</a> want that opportunity to have more people have this type of dialogue and that was missed on multiple accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4679.548s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5592.381s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, I want to thank Councilor Bears for bringing this forward I brought forward a similar resolution, a number of months ago, asking similar questions about the social justice roadmap as I pointed out then and I'd like to point out again. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5603.889s">This</a> roadmap was essentially a retrospective, you know, I appreciate the work that has been done and it was outlined but there was no. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5612.075s">concrete</a> plans for moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5614.436s">And</a> I think similar to the conversation we were just having, there's a missed opportunity for communication with our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5620.939s">I</a> was speaking with a resident recently who asked about the declaration from both the mayor and the council declaring systemic racism, public health crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5630.083s">And</a> they said, what does that do? <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5631.764s">And</a> as it was explained to us by the administration, <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5635.265s">Having</a> that declaration can unlock certain grant funding to address social determinants of health, and we haven't had an update on that since. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5644.512s">I'm</a> sure some of the work is going on, but it feels like a real missed opportunity to communicate to our community what this declaration means, what happens as a result of it, what work is going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5655.9s">And</a> despairingly, I had a conversation with a resident on Sunday that shared, you know, their father-in-law had a racial slur shouted at them in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5664.462s">So</a> there's, our residents are dealing with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5668.603s">They're</a> facing these issues and the least we can get is an update and talk about where we go from here because promises have been made, declarations have been made, and their residents and this council deserve an update about where we go from here. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5682.405s">What</a> work is being done? <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5683.586s">How</a> is this being funded? <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5685.306s">who's</a> being engaged around this. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5686.808s">So</a> I thank Councilor Beres for bringing this forward and keeping this top of mind and hopefully getting those answers soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5693.314s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19__tT-sIarT8Q/2024-11-19__tT-sIarT8Q.html">City Council 09-21-21</a></h2>

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9203.976s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9204.636s">I</a> just want to add, I want to thank Tom and Marsha for coming out and just the entire commission for the work they do, because these are issues that if they don't affect you, it's so easy to not see because you're not experiencing them. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9216.082s">And</a> working on these issues and raising these issues is so important. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9218.603s">And</a> what President Caraviello said stuck out to me talking about what the MBTA had said previously about shutting down and making the whole station inaccessible. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9229.308s">for</a> the work that needs to be done, but for as long as the station's been around, it's been completely shut down. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9234.689s">It's</a> been completely inaccessible to a large group of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9238.13s">So</a> I really hope that now is the time we can actually get something done and make this an accessible station for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9244.171s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9394.879s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9395.739s">I</a> know Councilor Marks introduced something, a similar paper probably over a year ago at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9400.842s">I</a> know sometimes it feels like we're banging our head against the wall asking for DCR to do anything on the many streets they operate in our city, but I'm responding to requests from a number of residents that have concerns about safety in this area, a need for <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9414.287s">crosswalks</a> around the Rotary at High Street and Mystic Valley Parkway, similar to what exists in Arlington, which I believe is what Councilor Marks requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9421.192s">There</a> is now a beautiful, you know, master parkway plan from DCR. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9425.514s">Of</a> course, if there is one thing we know in Medford, we have no shortage of plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9429.077s">It's</a> the action that we really struggle with. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9431.498s">I've</a> spoken with Representative Garbali about, he did put in a request for DCR to put in something in the interim, whether it's crosswalks or anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9440.165s">I</a> think as people are home more, they're noticing how much people are speeding, they're noticing their neighbors as they try to cross the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9446.409s">They</a> simply cannot. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9447.33s">So</a> I'm just asking that we put out, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9450.292s">another</a> request to DCR to take some action on this, you know, action before they even start working on the master plan, because we know how long those can take, how long I think it can take to actually get funding, but there's a need for immediate safety improvements right now for residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9464.661s">So</a> that's what I'm looking for here.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10000.662s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10001.323s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Bears for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10003.046s">I</a> was curious if we could have a minute just to get an update on the sharrows that, so they're supposed to be the updated bike infrastructure when Winthrop Street is repaved whenever that happens, but there is the portion that was repaved, but they did not add the sharrows. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10016.186s">I</a> know showers aren't perfect but I think it does contribute to people just understanding that this is a multimodal road. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10022.007s">This</a> isn't just a road you fly down. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10024.028s">This</a> is what people walk, bike, they're trying to cross on. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10026.628s">So</a> if we could just get an update on that because I believe something strange happened, why the paint wasn't put down. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10031.749s">So</a> if we could get an update there.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10064.99s">If</a> I could, as a cyclist, I would say that it's perhaps divided how people feel about Sharrows.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10941.25s">I</a> think Councilor Bears for putting this on, and my fellow councilors for their thoughtful comments on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10945.474s">And</a> I thank Dave for bringing that forward, because I think we've seen what happens when Medford doesn't have a seat at the table in these state-level decision-making. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10952.4s">So</a> I really, you know, whatever comes out of it, I really hope that the administration will respond and make sure that Medford is in the room when these decisions are being made. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10960.246s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12504.414s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12505.555s">Thanks,</a> Councilor Fragedel. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12507.733s">bringing</a> us forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12508.934s">This</a> is I fully agree with the idea of this going to a committee the whole because I think we've all heard from residents who have lived in their homes for decades and they're experiencing flooding instances that they've never seen before and really bizarre scenarios that with extreme climate events are only going to increase so it's something that we need to get out ahead of even though we're already a little bit behind but <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12528.002s">something</a> we actually needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12529.643s">I</a> know the engineering department is working on it, but so that we're all fully in the loop. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12533.104s">So</a> how we can report back to residents and make sure that we're really focused on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12536.645s">So</a> I thank you for bringing this forward.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=13232.503s">I</a> found the extensive records to be in order and move approval.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=13244.511s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=13244.772s">Aye.</a>

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=617.118s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=617.839s">I</a> just want to echo what my fellow Councilors are saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=619.919s">And</a> thank you, Ron and the whole team for the tremendous amount of volunteer hours you've put in over 25 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=625.161s">Like</a> my fellow Councilors, I'm someone who benefited from youth sports, but those things don't happen on their own. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=630.143s">Someone</a> has to put that together, hold it together for as long as you all have. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=633.105s">So</a> I thank you for the tremendous effort, just this great community offering, and really just this offering, this inclusive offering to our young athletes in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=641.608s">So</a> thank you and congratulations on 25 years of great work.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1278.566s">Thank</a> you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1281.133s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Fabio, and thank you for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1283.914s">Congratulations,</a> Desmond. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1285.874s">As</a> someone who dropped out of the Brownies after about one year, the level of dedication and commitment that it takes to get to the rank of Eagle Scout is just something that will serve you so well in your life, but already serves the city of Medford and will continue to serve us as long as you choose to stay here. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1301.479s">So</a> I just congratulate you on such an achievement and all of your hard work to get here. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1307.781s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2067.293s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2067.953s">I</a> just have a question for the clerk for the chair for the note about for both elections in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2073.075s">Early</a> voting can begin not less than 10 days before the election. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2076.997s">Um,</a> this it seems for the September election. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2080.819s">That's</a> it's in a smaller window of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2083.14s">Is</a> that because of the Labor Day holiday? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2084.621s">There's</a> like special exception for that.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2097.99s">Okay,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2896.216s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2897.256s">I</a> understand the rationale of Councilor Marks' motion, as well as what Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2902.737s">Gail</a> is sharing. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2903.897s">I</a> personally don't feel comfortable cutting the days for early voting for the preliminary. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2908.998s">I</a> would support the original four days that were recommended. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2913.019s">And</a> that's just, as an elected official, I don't feel comfortable limiting the days. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=2917.38s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3230.744s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3231.585s">Councilor</a> Bears job. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3232.845s">My</a> memory. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3233.306s">I've</a> seen some people if I could for coordinator Gail through the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3238.248s">People</a> voted absentee for the first time last November. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3241.49s">They</a> still need to request to vote absentee to vote mail in ballot again. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3245.872s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3246.112s">They're</a> not going to automatically get something.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3277.868s">Great,</a> thank you, because I've seen that question posed in a number of places, and I just want to thank you and the clerk for doing the work on the banner and the signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3285.391s">That's</a> a request I've seen for a number of years, so I'm really excited to see those go out. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3289.752s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3641.598s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4198.212s">It's</a> a motion to accept.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4200.614s">It's</a> a motion to accept the suggested language. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=4203.375s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6421.577s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6421.937s">I</a> just want to say thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6423.138s">I</a> agree with Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6424.278s">I</a> think it may seem like this is a simple one off. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6426.34s">But</a> what we're doing right now is setting precedent. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6428.581s">And</a> if we don't get this right this time, the next time a petitioner comes before us, they're going to cite this case for their reason for why they're doing something a certain way. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6435.825s">So</a> we need to get it right. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6437.066s">And</a> I agree with Councilor Marks that this is <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6439.706s">this</a> is a public right of way, and we need to treat it as such and figure out the right way to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6443.97s">And</a> if that's charging, then that's charging. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6446.752s">But</a> I agree that I don't think we should move on this without just insight from our city engineer at this point.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7715.197s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7715.897s">Yeah,</a> I support the intention of this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7719.119s">I</a> think there's, I know personally there was a tree chipper down the street from me the other day, and he'd go running to the window to see which beloved tree is coming down. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7728.163s">And</a> I think that notification is really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7731.065s">You</a> know, trees don't benefit just the direct abutters, they direct, you know, they benefit the whole block, they cool the whole block. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7737.248s">So</a> I think just as advanced notification gives people a chance to, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7742.67s">whether</a> it's just get on the list for a new tree, buy their own tree, or just wrap their head around what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7747.253s">I</a> think this is important just for stewardship in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7750.216s">And</a> I also, I don't know if we need amended language to include the emergency situations or if the tree we're in would offer that if she joins us. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7760.703s">But</a> I do support this, but I also support the inclusion of emergency language.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8753.066s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8754.246s">Yeah,</a> I have this on here because I've had a number of bike commuters reach out lately just about certain improvements to streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8761.248s">A</a> lot of those streets are referenced in the infrastructure master plan that was put together by the Bicycle Advisory Commission, which I know was meant to be used as a guide suggestions for DPW and a city engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8774.111s">And</a> it is my understanding that these improvements are generally implemented only when a street is repaved. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8781.133s">And</a> as we know from <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8782.353s">this</a> very council, a very small number of streets are repaved each year, and a number of them just aren't even in this plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8790.196s">So,</a> you know, noting that we've got the Great Clippership Connector, which is connecting a number of greenways and a number of bike paths that they, bikes are mentioned in the draft of the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8807.064s">And</a> also just noting that ideally there will be hopefully substantial infrastructure money coming down from the federal level. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8813.89s">I</a> would just love an update from the administration on priorities around these improvements for bikes around the city if it's something that it's just going to keep being done kind of as we slowly repave streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8827.483s">or</a> if there is something in the works that if we do get infrastructure money, it'll be something we'll be moving quickly on. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8833.789s">So</a> I would just love an update so that it's something I can, you know, that can be shared with the cyclists and would-be cyclists in Medford.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9288.152s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9288.972s">Yeah,</a> since the implementation of these fees for essentially ride share, these have been used for a number of projects, but because of the pandemic, I know these companies took a hit, they weren't going out as often. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9300.375s">So</a> I'm just curious if there's any update that the administration can provide on what those numbers actually look like this year based on the lower rates of use. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9307.976s">I</a> know it was some topic of debate with the transportation bill, but just, it still stands the fact that these, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9315.425s">these</a> companies went out so much less during the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9318.347s">So</a> I'm curious what we can look at, what we're anticipating with that, and if there are any specific projects that this money is earmarked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9325.431s">So</a> just seeking an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9327.972s">Second.</a> <h2><a href="../2024-11-19_sPI3fdyUva8/2024-11-19_sPI3fdyUva8.html">City Council 07-13-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1210.922s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1211.663s">So</a> Tim, if I understand it's the access ramp is extending out onto the existing sidewalk is what's happening.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1220.788s">So</a> if you're, you know, parallel to the building, you know, you're walking down the sidewalk, so there will be, I guess, ramps on all three sides, I'm assuming so people who are just continuing down the sidewalk are able to, whether they're in a, you know, stroller mobility device are able to just go up and down that new ramp.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1253.64s">It</a> wouldn't necessarily break the path of anyone coming down the sidewalk, and they would have enough space for, you know, a stroller, a wheelchair, anything like that without having to, um, come in contact with this ramp.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1266.61s">Okay,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2215.84s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2216.46s">I'm</a> just, I do believe this, I'm thinking, I believe the citizens on High Street has this similar setup where there is a ramp that goes out onto the public sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2226.063s">Just</a> if that offers any precedent for these questions we're asking.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2591.379s">jump</a> the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2592.4s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2593.181s">Yeah,</a> I think Councilor Falco for bringing this forward, um, throughout the budget season and any financial paper that's come before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2601.308s">Alicia</a> is has spent countless hours with us and it's just a wealth of knowledge and helping us understand what's coming before us the impact and <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2608.374s">There</a> was rarely a question she couldn't answer, particularly in this time when where there's, you know, there's ARPA, there's COVID relief, there's so many things to understand in a short amount of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2617.8s">And</a> she really did an excellent job. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2620.741s">And</a> not because we just spent 30 hours in budget meetings, but I'm dreading next year's budget without her. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2624.864s">So</a> she'll be sorely missed and I congratulate her on her new appointment.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3786.058s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3786.918s">To</a> that same point, I don't know what the plans are as far as updating the website to reflect the new name of the Columbus School to the Mississauga. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3793.1s">I</a> know stuff has been changed in, I don't know the status of the physical signage, but I know there have been updates made in mapping tools. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3800.901s">So</a> if people are looking up, they may have issues ending up the right place. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3804.362s">So</a> I know it remains Columbus on the website for the polling location. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3807.803s">So</a> I just don't know what the plan is for that.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3837.702s">Absolutely,</a> yeah, and that makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3838.663s">I</a> just wanted to make sure in terms of wayfinding. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3840.744s">Okay,</a> thank you.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4837.537s">I</a> just want to echo vice president. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4839.018s">I</a> think councilor bears bringing this forward, but I think I have the same concerns as far as process and timing, just understanding if the pool does grow exponentially, which it can, you know, where are we then? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4847.984s">So</a> just can we drop this paper after the deadline? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4851.706s">Can,</a> will we get a response in time, which I don't know if we'll get those answers until it's too late. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4856.649s">But</a> I do think this is something that warrants for the discussion.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7634.735s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7635.455s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7635.595s">I</a> would thank you, madam mayor for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7637.457s">I</a> would, I'd agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7638.217s">I</a> have like that idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7638.918s">And</a> I think as councilor Scarpelli is pointing out, it's part of it is just, we're not getting our needs met. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7644.161s">You</a> know, sometimes it's just a quick question about what is the proper way to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7647.921s">And</a> to your point about the different attorneys and KPO offer different areas, I'm not sure that's ever even been presented to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7654.283s">It's</a> like, we'd go to a meeting and we'd see a new one there and be like, who are we getting tonight? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7658.223s">So</a> I think just understanding that would go a long way, but I really appreciate the idea of just, you know, someone dedicated to the council that can help us with, you know, just being above board, doing everything properly, because we hit on these new challenges all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7672.347s">And</a> I think to the point of, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7673.755s">KP</a> Law's experience, they have experience in these other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7676.276s">A</a> lot of times the question is, you know, asking Attorney Scanlon, what have other communities drafted? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7681.619s">What</a> are they doing in this area? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7682.859s">So</a> it seems like something that they could assist with, but we're not getting that assistance right now.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13047.345s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and I wanna thank the mayor for being here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13050.986s">I</a> think your presence has gone a long way in just helping us get those final questions answered and really hammer through some stuff, and I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13057.687s">And</a> I also appreciate the responses from the administration, really over the past day or so, helping to respond to some council calls, particularly for me, around the diversity director, bumping up that salary and the money for trees as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13074.23s">you</a> know, I think the administration for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13075.75s">And</a> I think just highlighting the fact that, you know, it's not about the council, it's about, you know, just our request to support city services and the essential staff that make it possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13085.373s">So</a> I thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13086.113s">And</a> also the essential staff, but I also wanna echo Councilor Scarpelli and thank Alicia for being with us for countless, countless hours and really answering all of our questions and answering them so fast and so thoroughly in a way that enables us to do our job, even if it takes us 30 hours of meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13103.532s">So</a> I'm in favor of this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13105.653s">It's</a> not a perfect document, but nothing is. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13108.875s">I</a> think it was, a lot of it was negotiated in good faith. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13112.017s">And</a> I believe the administration heard us last year and this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13116.48s">So</a> I hope it passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13118.781s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=272.435s">But</a> it's my understanding that because of the reason we would be using to go into this executive session, it's triggering that. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=279.156s">So</a> by using that reason, <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=281.465s">it</a> already triggers that 40 hour notice.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=930.525s">I</a> understand why it would be an OML violation to go into executive session as you're explaining it. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=936.246s">I'm</a> just frustrated that we're finding this out right now, as opposed to finding this out like Saturday, you know, when we had the time to invite the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=944.527s">So</a> that's just where my frustration lies right now, where we could have invited the parties to attend and had this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=951.769s">But</a> that's, so that's just where, and I absolutely understand what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=954.469s">I</a> thank you for explaining it, but I'm just kind of frustrated that we're finding it out now, as opposed to earlier when we could have planned. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=960.663s">I</a> understand, I do.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2553.272s">I</a> just have, it's a question similar Councilor Marks, maybe it's a little more. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2556.914s">If</a> parties are unable or unwilling to attend on a Friday, but they were noticed and invited, are we still able to, <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2563.977s">discuss</a> them or no?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2579.629s">So</a> there's like a potential that could last for 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2582.271s">We</a> could invite all, yeah, we could invite all these people and we can't get them to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2587.475s">So</a> we can't discuss it anyways.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2596.313s">I</a> know it's getting, I mean, we're just still just talking in numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2600.755s">I</a> know it's getting, you know, we're wavering to the hypothetical, but because we're talking a number of parties, I just want to understand, you know, if similar to what Councilor Mark was saying, if some of them cannot attend, but some can, are we able to discuss those who are in attendance or can we not discuss anything? <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2616.541s">I</a> wouldn't recommend it. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2617.502s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2618.868s">So</a> there's a likelihood that we put out this notice we invite these people we still can't have the meeting.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1581.846s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1582.506s">I</a> also want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward and for also taking the time to read all those career highlights and accolades, which are much deserved. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1590.711s">I</a> haven't had the fortune of knowing Deputy Chief Cronin as long as others, but in my short time of knowing him, I found everything Councilor Marks said to be true. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1599.076s">Just</a> be an incredibly kind, gracious, service-oriented person. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=1602.678s">And</a> Medford has been lucky to have him for 40 years, and I thank him for his service for 40 years, and I wish him all the best in retirement.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2502.948s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and thank you President Caravelle for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2506.016s">As</a> Councilor Falco mentioned there's a number of issues going on here I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2510.517s">Great</a> concern with the public safety issues in public health between the trash and the swimming and the open fires. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2516.178s">I've</a> been reaching out to DCR probably as long as I've lived here about the trash in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2519.799s">It</a> seems they have a carry and carry out policy, which essentially in practice is just carry and leave wherever you can find it in bags wherever else. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2527.66s">So</a> that's a major issue and I would love to have our state delegation help and see what we can do there because you can see it with your own eyes. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2535.442s">This</a> isn't something that can be ignored. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2536.862s">If</a> anyone from DCR ever drives by, they can see all the challenges that are faced. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2540.501s">public</a> health, public safety, and otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2543.061s">I</a> do have concerns just about the private ways as far as enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2547.942s">It's</a> my understanding by state statute that because these aren't accepted as public ways, we can't use city money for the police to enforce parking on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2559.204s">I</a> support Councilor Scarpelli as far as moving to a committee of the whole and just exploring this. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2564.445s">I</a> would be interested in because the ideal way to do this is these streets become accepted as public ways, <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2570.418s">If</a> we could get just insight from this, the city engineer the traffic engineer, or the process of accepting these private ways as public ways so we can enforce them as such. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2581.386s">And</a> if there's a priority list, or you know any process that exists already for moving a number of these private ways that have a number of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2589.903s">And</a> accepting them as public ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2592.567s">And</a> I do just want to read also from the Commission on parking and policy and enforcement, they did address this issue and one of the recommendations was. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2601.083s">to</a> consider a program where residents of private ways can enforce parking by towing, which is allowable by the state statute. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2607.625s">This</a> program would allow residents of private ways to file a permit notifying the city of the preferred tow company for that private way to tow away vehicles parked illegally on that private way. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2616.189s">I</a> guess this is a program that's done in Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2619.09s">Medford</a> isn't alone in having private ways, but we are specific to having very desirable private ways for parking for a number of resources within the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2628.679s">So</a> I would love to have that committee of the whole to really talk this through and address this. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=2633.641s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3081.98s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3082.76s">I</a> just want to note that by I believe our current ordinance and our number of legal cases at the state level enforcement related to public safety is allowable and encouraged. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3093.905s">And</a> there's a number of reasons related to public safety that the street, the police can enforce on private ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3100.308s">So</a> I think to Councilor Behr's point, there may be something easy we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3105.43s">The</a> city solicitor can help us out with because this is a public safety issue.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4557.944s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4558.804s">Councilor</a> Bears mostly covered it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4560.285s">So</a> this was actually, there was an article about this recently about, you know, those most likely to benefit from this are probably largely unaware of the program and some 53% of people may not know about this tax credit. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4573.132s">So</a> a resident brought this to our attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4575.573s">So</a> just getting this out there and also it may be beneficial just as a side comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4582.035s">The</a> board of health I know is working really hard as far as snap gap and identifying people who are not enrolling in benefits that they are eligible for. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4590.698s">So</a> this seems like something similar to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4592.418s">Perhaps</a> the schools could reach out to the board of health to see how they're identifying and reaching out to people to ensure that they are enrolling in programs that they are eligible for. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4601.582s">So</a> move approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4608.144s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=4608.304s">On</a> the motion, and Council Member Beall is in the room, I'll second it by Councilor Belco.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=425.908s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=426.929s">I'm</a> curious if we could also request from the city solicitor just if this does, in fact, open us up to liability, if it's up to code, you know, does that open us up to liability? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=436.474s">I</a> mean, I know people can sue for whatever, but are we, in fact, opened up to liability if this meets the code?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=445.039s">An</a> amendment, if you'll oblige. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=448.581s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1799.664s">If</a> we could move on to Laurel, I mean, Laurel.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2831.059s">I</a> want to thank Vice President Knight and Councilor Falco for bringing this forward, as well as my <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2835.625s">fellow</a> Councilors for their amendments and particularly Councilor Scarpelli for really raising the issue of volatility in the weather. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2842.429s">You</a> know, one thing with climate change, we know we're going to have these more volatile patterns and also we're going to have an increase in above 90 degree days. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2850.297s">than</a> we historically have had. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2851.578s">So</a> I think as mentioned also by Councilor Bears, these arbitrary timelines or dates are really putting people in danger and not serving the people that I think perhaps they were originally designed to protect. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2862.904s">So</a> I support the council action on this and really appreciate the efforts to make sure we're protecting our residents.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2951.35s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, Director Durham, like everyone, every Councilors mentioned your speech on Memorial Day really struck me and stuck with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2958.453s">And</a> I think you have, you know, I've heard you speak a few times before, and you have such a way of delivering, you know, the commitment, the challenges, the reality of your experience and the experience of many other veterans that I think is really <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2972.018s">impactful</a> to people and you highlighted unprecedented challenges that are being faced by today's veterans. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2978.186s">And</a> I think it's so important as you said that as you're saying now just, you know, the mental health issues and really addressing those the unprecedented on employment crisis, you know, worse than our Vietnam veterans when they were returning so. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2991.711s">Highlighting</a> that and the work that we can do today to support today's veterans I think is so essential and I thank you for bringing that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2998.897s">Both</a> of my grandfathers are Navy were Navy veterans they both passed away and knowing that there's someone like you, helping out people like them in the current generation, I think really means a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3010.286s">You</a> know, even just looking at the, the budget narrative and the budget book, the incredible amount of work you do in such a small department, not just for Medford, but beyond beyond is something that is so needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3022.979s">We're</a> so thankful for and something we should be really proud of. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3026.583s">I</a> thank you for raising, you know, talking about Post 45. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3029.665s">I</a> live near the cemetery and there is no corner of that cemetery where you don't see those little flags. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3035.248s">And</a> I think it really demonstrates just the people of Bedford have fought and, you know, fought for our freedoms in every single war we've been involved in. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3043.892s">And</a> the work that Post 45 and the volunteers do to honor that and mark that is so important. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3049.956s">And</a> lastly, you know, I thank you for taking the time to really talk about D-Day on the anniversary. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3053.898s">It's,</a> you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3055.718s">what,</a> again, what everyone else said, what more can you say about the greatest generation, but I think it's just tremendous sacrifice. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3062.143s">And</a> I think as we talk about the realities of coming home from war today, it maybe gives us a different framing on what people were facing them that maybe didn't get talked about or often didn't get talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3072.211s">So</a> I just I thank you for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3074.613s">And</a> I thank you for really speaking so eloquently on all those topics.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=2734.78s">Great,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=2736.221s">And</a> what is our, remind me, what's our city, what's our vaccination rate in the city right now?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=2753.011s">Okay,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=2753.531s">Thanks</a> so much, Marianne. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=2754.231s">Thanks</a> for taking the time to be here tonight.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=730.798s">Is</a> there anticipated either traffic or pedestrian impact while this project is going on? <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=735.204s">Will</a> people have to be diverted at all while this work is happening?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=743.254s">I'm</a> sorry?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=747.88s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=750.202s">I'm</a> not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=750.823s">I'm</a> not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=751.463s">But,</a> uh, timing wise, since the other grant of location we have, um, is kind of diagonally across the street is are these being tied together? <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=759.349s">You</a> know, as far as the intention of when to do the work, I know there's still, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=763.312s">Some</a> requirements from our city engineer, but I'm curious the desired timing as far as the work of the two projects.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3117.215s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3118.236s">I</a> also want to thank Councilor Mark for his board and his due diligence. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3121.718s">I</a> like Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3123.519s">I</a> obviously wasn't on the council at the time, but it was my understanding as a resident that the sidewalk would be continued the whole way. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3128.703s">So</a> I really appreciate Councilor Mark's pointing that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3132.105s">I</a> think the issue here is too that because of these promises from Eversource and also I believe there's the project on Winthrop Street, the giant pool, <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3141.972s">has</a> also, you know, there's been some promise that they will do the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3146.193s">Because</a> of this, we're lacking sidewalk in perpetuity. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3148.674s">We</a> keep on being told, we're not going to handle it as a city because XYZ is going to handle it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3153.816s">And</a> we're going on several years now of a very obvious dangerous situation that we have no date in sight when this is actually going to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3162.578s">And</a> I wish I wish what Council Marks was saying was true. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3165.759s">I</a> think it is true sometimes that people do slow down the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3168.08s">A</a> lot of times they don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3170.221s">They're</a> also trying to avoid the plates. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3171.942s">So</a> you have areas where maybe there's sidewalk but there's not appropriate curbing and your cars that are kind of driving you know zigzagging around the plates and it's just incredibly dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3182.058s">So</a> I really think Councilor Marks for bringing this up and really staying on this because this is a major issue in our community and something that, you know, we've been promised a safety update that the finish line just keeps on moving and it's unclear when it's ever going to be made safe for residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3197.626s">So</a> I fully support the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3199.287s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3754.249s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3754.989s">I</a> just have one question for the city engineer, if I could, through the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3758.471s">Does</a> the city, so I mean, the hope is that Eversource is going to meet the council's and residents' demands about the sidewalk extension, completing it to place that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3768.556s">But</a> I'm curious, does the city have a contingency plan or a plan for the sidewalk portion? <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3774.219s">Is</a> it met? <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3774.619s">We're</a> talking about one of the busiest thoroughfares in the city that a lot of people are walking down or trying to move down as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3781.422s">And</a> I'm curious if there's a city plan <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3783.723s">to</a> make up that missing sidewalk if these companies don't.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3885.816s">Okay,</a> yes, it does. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3886.657s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=200.204s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=201.425s">Yeah,</a> this is just seeking an update from the administration on the three ongoing projects, which to my understanding are still making their way through council. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=208.65s">As</a> you know, this is a recurring item. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=210.511s">This</a> has been placed by yourself on the agenda before. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=213.274s">Just</a> seeking information and update from the administration, particularly because <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=217.877s">These</a> three developments are listed in the housing production plan that was delivered to us as affordable housing in the pipeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=223.963s">So</a> I'm just seeking to understand if this is affordable housing that is actually coming through or this is actively being fought by the administration and what the update is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=232.751s">So</a> just seeking a written update from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=235.734s">I</a> don't know if there's anyone on the call tonight either.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=518.445s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=519.726s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2269.116s">I</a> don't, I know this came before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2271.858s">I</a> don't think we actually, if I'm wrong, I don't think we had a meeting on this one specifically. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2275.18s">I</a> know this came before us, the multiple awnings, but I do not believe that this made it through our committee for this LED message center.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2321.208s">I</a> mean, I'm happy to vote on it tonight, unless Councilor Marks is also on the subject.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2525.196s">I</a> would move to vote on this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2526.637s">I</a> agree with my fellow councilors that there's no shortage of signs at this location. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2531.259s">It's</a> pretty clear in our sign ordinance that movement is prohibited, which the business should be familiar with our sign ordinance at this point, considering the previous petitions for reversal. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2540.923s">So</a> I would move to vote on this tonight and I would move for a denial.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2998.795s">Sure,</a> it was a highlight of the report, which had several charges from the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3002.957s">We</a> discussed a lot of policy, policy suggestions, some of which really conversation hinged on just simple enforcement of laws or statutes that are already on the books. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3015.582s">And</a> we also explored what it might look like for it to take things in house, as well as kind of another, several common issues which are mentioned in the report and we're waiting to see what the administration does in it and seeing also what, how we can act on this as soon as possible and not leave it as just a report.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=8214.554s">I'm</a> just not sure what we're going after at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=8216.435s">We're</a> just engaging in open debate at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=8218.216s">I'm</a> not really sure what's happening.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1705.149s">How</a> many street trees do you know?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1717.745s">Okay,</a> and inclusive, so I would understand the ones on the property would obviously be managed or by BJ's landscaping. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1724.971s">For</a> the street trees, would those also be managed by BJ's?

Bone of contention and that it's essentially Verizon coming in for all of their benefit. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5269.711s">No</a> talk about how this could benefit the city of Medford or what impacts, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5274.392s">Could</a> be for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5276.172s">Um</a> I also, um, being on the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5278.913s">I</a> definitely took issue with the, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5281.714s">The</a> representative from Verizon. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5283.054s">I</a> uh, the scientist that was <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5290.731s">different</a> times. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5291.651s">I</a> don't think that did anyone any favors by having that gentleman really talk down to residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5296.634s">A</a> lot of people have very valid questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5299.295s">And</a> again, as other councils have pointed out, we don't have the people we should have independent experts to help answer that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5306.398s">We</a> are in no shortage of people studying this at our many great universities surrounding us. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5310.72s">So</a> I think it would be, again, as others have pointed out, very beneficial. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5314.879s">to</a> have those people to speak to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5317.84s">I</a> very much support more research on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5320.101s">Unfortunately,</a> that's not what's before us right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5323.202s">I</a> would like to add, I guess it would be a C paper at this point, in that it's my understanding that if we were to either adopt an ordinance or if the policy were to be updated, I don't know if that could be applied to the 44 <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5343.863s">Um,</a> that applications are already in. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5345.584s">It's</a> my understanding from the FCC, the way the legislation is written, that these aesthetic requirements or any conditions have to be set prior to receiving applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5356.573s">So</a> I would just seek clarity on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5358.614s">You</a> know, if we were to adopt, um, additional conditions, if the city were to adopt additional conditions, could they actually be, uh, could they stand? <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5368.902s">Could</a> they be legally applied, um, to existing applications?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=7327.889s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=7328.81s">I</a> think Councilor bears for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=7332.231s">This</a> year marked the first time the state had a presidential proclamation, and it remains really more important than ever to celebrate and recognize transgender and non-binary people, and also acknowledge the violence and discrimination that many transgender and non-binary people, especially trans women of color and black trans women still face. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=7352.141s">So</a> as Councilor Bears alluded to, I want to note that so far, and this is as of last week, according to the HRC, there are 192 <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=7360.689s">anti</a> LGBTQ bills under consideration state legislatures across the country at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=7365.752s">And</a> of those 93 directly target transgender people. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=7369.774s">So</a> this resolution is very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=7372.636s">And</a> I very much support it.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=10589.252s">You</a> may see her, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=10590.013s">Sharon's</a> had her hand up for quite some time.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2638.288s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, I want to thank you and Councilor Falco for bringing this forward because I think this is so important. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2646.403s">I</a> think that every route that someone relies on in the city is essential to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2649.784s">And</a> I think it's really important that the City Council continues to be loud and communicate this to the powers that be because the MBTA has suggested and walked back a number of cuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2662.448s">And</a> I think it's really important that we raise the issue that this needs to be brought back immediately and get them to make that change. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2668.951s">And</a> Councilor Falco brings up a really good point that when these routes go away, they tend not to come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2676.226s">the</a> councilors for bringing this forward because I think it's really important that the council and the city sends this message. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2681.027s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3189.872s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3190.993s">This</a> resolution is pretty self explanatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3193.374s">But</a> as we all know, not too long ago, we were talking about the deficit we're looking at for this year's budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3199.598s">And</a> now within the past few weeks, we've heard tell of, you know, perhaps $39 million in direct local aid coming to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3207.403s">And</a> the most recent estimates published in the globe last week were $50 million for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3212.746s">I</a> do understand that, you know, even just by those changing numbers, this is <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3216.843s">obviously</a> something that's kind of hard to keep track of. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3218.924s">Everyone's</a> learning as we go along, but as we're looking to do, you know, really the most important role of the council in a few short months, I think it would be very helpful to have an idea, any information, any official information we can get from the administration about how this money, you know, what they've heard about how this money has to be used, the timeframe, how they're hoping to use it, what ideal scenarios would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3243.687s">Um,</a> so I mean, I did have the chief of staff reach out to me earlier, just saying that director and only Benjamin couldn't be here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3249.268s">So</a> I'm just hoping we can get an update on this soon, because this is, this is an incredible amount of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3254.329s">And</a> I do understand it can't likely cannot be used for everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3257.43s">And</a> there's going to be strings attached, but it's still a large amount of money that we haven't gotten any update on what it might look like for the city and what the administration is thinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=3266.731s">Uh,</a> so I move approval.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4587.811s">Yes,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4588.712s">Yeah,</a> that's correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4589.353s">That's</a> my understanding was more about looking at, you know, zones. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4593.097s">And</a> I mean, there was a number of things I addressed, but yes, it wasn't, it didn't really, it didn't touch on our public parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4598.622s">So</a> that was kept separate from the commission.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5179.652s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5180.233s">I</a> do just want to note that there are, I can find the best way to get it to the council, but there are a number of public folders and documents about the work that the commission has been doing and what the charge from the mayor is specifically, I think is actually on the city website. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5194.83s">just</a> to add some clarity to that, that that information is readily accessible for those questions around it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=5201.271s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_YjIKMi7y7_Q/2024-11-19_YjIKMi7y7_Q.html">City Council 03-23-21</a></h2>

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1457.702s">So</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1459.343s">And</a> then following up on that with the registration or the sign up for that, is that something that <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1464.118s">we</a> would have to build or that would be all through the state, they would handle that?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1503.427s">But</a> okay, so yeah, just the follow up would be, so if someone's, you know, they're, they're already pre registered, or they go and pre register, this may just be an option that comes up for them when it's available. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1516.293s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1517.233s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1517.693s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1518.514s">That's</a> all I have.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2284.615s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2285.596s">My</a> point was addressed earlier, so I'm all set, thank you.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=1472.149s">And</a> then thinking to the housing authority, everyone in those buildings, those people are already being contacted. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=1480.375s">That</a> kind of rule I just said doesn't apply.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2461.561s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2462.442s">Yeah,</a> I thank the mayor for introducing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2465.404s">It's</a> very much needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2467.906s">And</a> I read something this past weekend that was startling, but I guess not too surprising at this point, in that one in three people has lost someone to COVID, someone in their lives to COVID, and more than half of those people who have died in the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2482.397s">have</a> passed since November. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2484.74s">And</a> I say this to just note the incredible impact and the long haul of this, something that's been felt acutely by those working diligently in community health, supporting Medford residents through loss of their loved ones, loss of jobs, loss of incomes, loss of normalcy and stability. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2503.59s">And</a> this past year has been an incredible weight to bear for all of us, but really no one has shouldered the burden quite like our community centers or volunteers or public health workers <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2514.126s">that</a> are on the call tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2515.467s">And</a> these staff and these volunteers have given endlessly of themselves at a time when we're all facing collective trauma, grief, and loss, and sometimes makes us act in ways that doesn't make their jobs any easier. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2527.511s">So</a> again, I thank the mayor for introducing this proclamation to commend and honor the work of such an important group of people, really led fearlessly by Marian O'Connor, who has had no shortage of difficult and light speed decisions to make under a microscope. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2541.942s">And</a> I don't think I can commend her enough for that work. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2543.862s">And</a> I think the whole community is so appreciative of that work. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=2546.843s">So</a> I wholly support this, and I'm really honored to have these individuals in our community and working for our community.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5139.624s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5140.485s">Yeah,</a> it's hard to hard to go last when someone such a hard working and highly committed person this community, but I like everyone else on the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5149.052s">Seemingly</a> everyone else in the community have had the pleasure of working with Brian through some through some things at the West Medford Community Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5156.892s">He's</a> a stalwart there. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5157.772s">He</a> does an incredible amount of work there. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5159.853s">And</a> thank you, Councilor Bears and thank you for Brian for speaking on it, the girls basketball program, because that's something that I think when your name comes up, people just talk about, you know, recently, just how wildly popular and successful that program was and really loved and you know, as as things get back to normal, hopefully coming back. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5177.021s">So</a> I think that's just a really great example of the kind of work you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5180.342s">And</a> as far as that listening, so I, I <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5183.166s">support</a> this appointment and I think you would be a great addition to the Hormel Commission.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2533.495s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2534.896s">So</a> this was brought to the council's attention by someone very near and dear to us all, Mr. Gordon, who helps to make these meetings possible and accessible. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2543.3s">So</a> these bills, it's the identical bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2546.142s">I</a> know they, identical docket number, docket. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2549.244s">I</a> know that these haven't been assigned a bill just yet, but I think it's something that needs to come with our support early. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2554.907s">Essentially,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2555.925s">These</a> are seeking to assess fees for streaming services that rely on digital infrastructure that's at least partially in public rights away. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2563.369s">And</a> then a portion of funds collected in this way would go to the Commonwealth General Fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2566.951s">And</a> most importantly, to municipalities proportionally based on population and to community centers proportionally based on population. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2574.294s">So</a> this is really important at this time as more and more people cut the cord from cable and money to public education and government media gain through these agreements is really impacted as a result of those changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2586.032s">So</a> this is really a measure to encourage our local delegation to support these. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2593.974s">And</a> I did get word that Christine Barber did sign on as a co-sponsor after I submitted this item. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2600.896s">And</a> it's really just to make sure we have the funding from these systems in place to continue to support our diverse community, robust and diverse community media, and to really respond to the changing behaviors of both providers and subscribers.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3326.102s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3327.163s">Yeah,</a> I agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3327.843s">I</a> really, I understand where Councilor Scarpelli is coming from, and I really appreciate the way and the consideration with which you introduced this. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3335.645s">So</a> I'm just trying, I am also going to be voting against this this evening, but I just want to explain where I'm coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3340.975s">I</a> do still have some concerns about duration. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3344.537s">Ideally,</a> hopefully we're all vaccinated by budget season. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3347.439s">This</a> is not something we even have to worry about, but we do have some exponentially long budget meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3353.223s">I</a> think we had a 10 hour meeting last year and, and duration of exposure really comes into effect with the virus and aerosols. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3360.787s">And</a> again, just concern over the variant. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3362.849s">So</a> I very much feel like we're almost there. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3365.651s">This</a> just feels a little bit premature to me, so I will be voting against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3368.632s">But</a> again, I very much appreciate the way it was introduced and your concern and respect for other people's positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3374.793s">Councilor</a> Scarpelli, thank you.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4049.51s">Thank</a> you, President Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4050.431s">If</a> I could ask a question of Chief of Staff Rodriguez to the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4055.233s">The</a> language that establishes this special revenue fund in one section notes that <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4060.657s">the</a> treasurer of the city of Medford shall provide a report to the mayor and city council, which shall include but not be limited to the amount of donations and appropriations received the amount of grants and loans made and to whom and the balance of the special fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4073.228s">I</a> know this was just recently passed, so I'm curious when we might be able to expect to see something like that.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4085.829s">sure,</a> in the in the acts that establishes special revenue fund, there is a section that says annually, the treasurer of the city of Medford shall provide a report to the mayor and city council, which shall include but not be limited to the amount of donations and appropriations received the amount of grants and loans made, and to whom and the balance of the special fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4103.245s">I'm</a> just curious, as I know, this was recently passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4105.648s">I'm</a> just curious, we could maybe expect to see something like that.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4167.448s">Yes,</a> that would be much appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4170.03s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4832.896s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4833.696s">I</a> just want to thank Councilor Falco for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4836.158s">I</a> agree this is very important, and I have seen in surrounding communities that they always ensure that these notices are translated in a number of applicable languages. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4846.183s">I</a> know that's to be discussed as this goes to subcommittee or committee of the whole, but I just want to note that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4851.645s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5565.294s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5567.675s">I</a> just want to read off a few stats in addition to what was worded in the resolution itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5573.216s">So</a> the amount of carbon monoxide emitted from a typical backpack leaf blower for just one hour is equal to the amount of carbon monoxide coming from the tailpipe of a car operating for over eight hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5584.518s">that's</a> going to be a lot of dust and particles in the air. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5587.84s">The</a> floors push 300 to 700 cubic feet of air per minute at speeds of 150 to 280 miles per hour with the resulting dust containing particles that can include pollen, mold, animal feces, heavy metals, break lining powder and chemicals from herbicides and pesticides. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5604.012s">And</a> for the user of a leaf blower, the noise <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5612.061s">a</a> lover that has been demonstrated to trigger increases in blood pressure and heart rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5617.264s">So</a> these stats stand on their own, but the main reason I introduced this resolution is that I've heard from countless residents over the constant onslaught of leaf blowers year round with really, the only time these machines aren't being used is when there's snow on the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5631.21s">So</a> we have a little bit of respite right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5633.471s">And</a> these residents aren't reaching out because they're disturbed by a leaf blower for an hour when the neighbor's yard crew comes because <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5641.617s">they</a> spend hours a day listening to yard crews that sometimes have three leaf blowers going at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5648.62s">We</a> know how big our lots are in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5650.601s">They're</a> not that big, but I think they require three people simultaneously using a leaf blower. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5656.323s">And</a> this, of course, is all happening while people are working remotely, while students are trying to learn remotely, while people are trying to sleep after working the night shift. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5665.871s">And</a> also we spend a lot of our meetings talking about a respiratory disease that has gripped the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5670.495s">And</a> a lot of these issues contribute to respiratory issues are exasperated by this gas-powered liquor use. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5678.561s">I'm</a> not naive to the fact that I understand that sometimes this can be a controversial thing to raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5683.766s">But</a> what I'm asking for here is to send this to the Environmental Affairs Subcommittee so that it can be studied. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5689.483s">you</a> can hear from residents, people that would be affected by this, and look at, you know, regulations that are working in places like Arlington, Cambridge, Newton, and Brookline, and also look at other things that may exist, whether there's grant opportunities for incentivization for transitioning to electric leaf blowers, which are much less, obviously, you don't have the emissions, they're much quieter, and they operate in a slightly lower <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5713.823s">speed.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5714.363s">So</a> I'm asking to move this to subcommittee to really work on this and see what's something that can work for as many people as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5720.967s">But</a> I cede to Councilor Bears.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5887.724s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5890.626s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5891.247s">I</a> just, I wasn't clear in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5893.268s">This</a> is something I'm looking, I think looking at private lots, I understand the need of DPW and larger scale. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5900.234s">So</a> I just want to clarify that looking at, you know, private use for this kind of stuff, private lots.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6231.082s">I</a> mean, the intent is to study the issue to come out with, you know, common sense regulations that I think work for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6236.866s">One</a> thing that I fail to be specific about is something that's working in other communities is looking at the number of leaf blowers allowed per lot size. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6246.112s">Again,</a> we have, you know, a 6,000 square foot lot and we have three people running gas powered leaf blowers, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6253.298s">there's</a> somewhere we could meet in the middle there, but I mean, the idea is to study it, to find and hear from the people, hear from the stakeholders in the community, find a way to meet all of, you know, meet as many goals as we can, as far as people having better quality of life, you know, not harming businesses, seeing what we can do here.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6308.506s">The</a> resolution doesn't say that?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6342.465s">I'd</a> like to keep it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6343.045s">I</a> don't want that amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6344.686s">I'd</a> like to keep the paper as is.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6612.854s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6613.835s">To</a> Council Mark's points, I'm happy to have that folded in. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6616.096s">I</a> think that is reason, I guess I would agree now with the amendment to make this study and report back out to the council because it seems that we shouldn't limit it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6627.622s">And</a> I'm happy to have all of these things on the table to study.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6640.484s">I</a> believe we're having a discussion right now and I'm happy to adjust based on the very valid points that councilors have raised.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6661.116s">Yeah,</a> I believe that's why I introduced the resolution so that we could look at this and discuss this.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6689.244s">I'll</a> withdraw that denial if I can.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6702.752s">Can</a> I withdraw my denial to Councilor Knight's amendment and change it so I accept it?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6712.517s">The</a> amendment's seconded. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6714.998s">No,</a> it has to be... All right.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6741.451s">Yes,</a> and also I do know there are people here who want to speak on this as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6744.491s">Mr.</a> President, just so you know, that's not what the
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6751.647s">I</a> thought we were discussing an amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6753.79s">I'm</a> happy to amend the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6754.911s">I'm</a> not, I don't understand where Councilor Knight's amendment, I'm being told it's accepted, it's not accepted.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6799.737s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6799.978s">I</a> just don't know if the amendment from Councilor Knight still stands or not.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6822.536s">And</a> it says- Yes, I'm happy to amend the paper to say for study to report back out to the council.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6850.717s">I</a> see Norman Kaplan has his hand up.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6342.915s">Mr.</a> President? <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6343.736s">Yes,</a> Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6346.458s">I</a> know there are a number of people who came to speak on this, so I don't, if they're unable to speak because this is ruled out of order, if it can be made clear that they can speak at public participation at the end of the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6356.664s">That</a> is fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6358.065s">And</a> I do, since I know since a number of fellow councilors raised the issue, the resources that the city does have to offer, the city does have a number of resources people can access. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6368.23s">Unfortunately,</a> people have to remain in their homes to be able to access them and have these relief programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6374.713s">So</a> if people are evicted, their rental assistance does them no good if they are already evicted. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6379.728s">their</a> apartment. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6380.569s">So</a> I just want to add that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6381.83s">So</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6382.351s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6870.628s">Councilor</a> Moreau. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6872.698s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6873.638s">I</a> don't even know who can see me. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6875.259s">I</a> just want to thank Roberta and Danielle for coming out and for the presentation we got last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6880.641s">I</a> think it's really exciting that all of these projects are focused on outdoor space, which is ever more important to us with the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6888.464s">And</a> I think we'll really be looking forward to in this summer and the coming summers as these projects are completed and increased access to all of these projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6896.626s">So</a> I support all of them and I'm excited to move forward with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6900.388s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=8533.941s">Mr.</a> President, if I could, sorry.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=8538.463s">Okay,</a> I just wanted to share, to address Mr. Schnapp's question, I did have someone just send me a tableau visualization. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=8546.487s">And</a> the note is that there are currently 50 court cases in Medford related to non-payment of rent. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=8554.931s">To</a> address that request for that number.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=8559.614s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=9517.573s">Yes.</a> <h2><a href="../2024-11-19_L-hLu0ibDYc/2024-11-19_L-hLu0ibDYc.html">City Council 12-08-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=88.575s">Councilor</a> Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=89.796s">Motion</a> to take paper 20-672 out of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=92.959s">I</a> know Anne-Marie with the Medford Streets program is only able to be on for the earlier part of the meeting.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=177.327s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=178.007s">It's</a> my understanding that Annemarie Aigner is on the call. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=181.71s">She's</a> behind this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=182.751s">I</a> think she can speak more specifically into what they're seeking.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=213.825s">Yeah,</a> it's Anne-Marie Aigner, A-I-G-N-E-R. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=218.548s">And</a> I think it's just that their request has been updated.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=353.434s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=354.475s">I</a> did speak with Anne Marie and I know a few just food trucks are operating this way and that they're taking all orders ahead of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=360.758s">So</a> it's really people placing orders ahead of time online. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=363.159s">People</a> come out to the food truck. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=364.38s">It's</a> a, you know, a contactless handoff to get their meals, social distancing, waiting. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=369.382s">I</a> think it's really just another way to kind of get get take-out in these times.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1271.761s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1477.781s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1478.601s">I</a> don't know who's here to answer questions right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1481.343s">I</a> have some questions, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1483.425s">Are</a> all the same people present on this to address questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1486.467s">Yeah,</a> you can ask questions now if you like. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1488.668s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1490.169s">I</a> have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1491.99s">I</a> know, I apologize, I didn't print out the tip. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1495.433s">I</a> just have it on my phone, the actual proposed agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1498.515s">But</a> I know there's the option that if the, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1501.937s">there's</a> the opportunity and process to decertify the TIF. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1507.52s">Is</a> there a process for through the state or I guess other measures for clawbacks if the terms of this weren't met and it were decertified? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1517.966s">I</a> don't know who's on the phone.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1530.093s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1530.433s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1559.098s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1560.039s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1560.199s">The</a> question is just if, you know, if the process to decertify happens because the terms of this agreement aren't met, is there an opportunity or mechanism through the state for clawbacks or is that something that the city would have to pursue otherwise? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1572.501s">Or</a> have you seen other cities do this again? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1576.602s">Not</a> that I don't want this to happen, but I'm just trying to understand what that process might look like.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1667.223s">I'm</a> just trying to understand what that would look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1669.305s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1669.445s">And</a> but there's nothing prohibiting clawbacks. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1672.007s">If</a> that were something that were to happen again. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1673.588s">I</a> don't want this to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1674.588s">I'm</a> not speaking this, but I'm just trying to understand what that would look like.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1681.233s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1682.995s">And</a> then I just have one more question specifically about the tip. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1685.096s">I</a> believe it says. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1685.937s">And</a> again, I <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1699.029s">So</a> the hiring would occur over those five years to get to the total of 250. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1701.872s">Let's</a> see.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1736.845s">And</a> then I believe the chief of staff said last week, then that the terms of the TIF are so that those jobs are held at least until the end of the TIF in 2030 or I guess 2031. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1749.983s">Correct?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1751.024s">Or</a> that's how I understood it?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1754.349s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1785.415s">OK,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1785.915s">Yeah,</a> that was my original question. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1786.995s">I</a> was just trying to reflect the language I see in the actual proposed agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1791.016s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1791.397s">That's</a> all I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1792.417s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Morell.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1989.232s">Councilor</a> Bears.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2004.92s">Councilor</a> Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2006.501s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2007.462s">I</a> do have one more question regarding if there is any update from the administration as far as findings regarding to the applicability of the soldier ordinance to this project and what that might look like.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2143.473s">Okay,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2144.054s">Thank</a> you both.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6741.613s">Thank</a> you Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6742.634s">Before</a> we take the vote on the owner occupied exemption, I do want to just share that I very much support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6748.622s">I</a> do think it's something that Medford very much needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6751.425s">Based</a> on the presentation we had earlier tonight in the Committee of the Whole, as far as Ellen recommending that <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6756.912s">If</a> Medford were to adopt this, it needs to be done earlier in the year so residents can actually benefit from this and apply for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6764.055s">So</a> I'm going to be voting no tonight, but I do very much believe that Medford would benefit from an owner-occupied exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6769.897s">I</a> look forward to a future presentation from Ellen on this more in depth and more conversation around this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6776.78s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7764.274s">you.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7764.554s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7764.794s">Mister</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7765.214s">If</a> I could through the chair, just a question for Mister LaRusso. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7768.695s">There's</a> those big, beautiful windows on the property there previously filled with antiques. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7773.497s">But</a> I do know your neighbors, potential neighbors at Bistro 5 take a more kind of subdued approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7779.079s">The</a> windows. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7779.519s">I'm</a> just curious what you envision for those big if you wouldn't have that space.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7825.668s">OK,</a> yeah, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7826.569s">I</a> know and I know this is not what you're proposing, but I think some people's fears stem from the fact of thinking they someone's going to wander up to the window and pick out their tattoo and go inside. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7835.783s">So</a> I appreciate you clarifying that.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7918.511s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7918.851s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8671.609s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8672.749s">Yeah,</a> I just have one more question thinking about signage and this, I support this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8677.591s">So</a> this is an kind of a inhibitor to that, but talking, so you mentioned signage in the windows. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8683.593s">I</a> know there's currently just kind of the larger signage on the facade that exists at the current space. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8690.276s">Do</a> you imagine you'll be using that as well? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8692.456s">And</a> will that, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8695.037s">I'm</a> just trying to think out loud and understand what this might look like in total, assuming that other tattoo place also.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8732.875s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8804.771s">Okay,</a> Great. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8805.352s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8805.652s">And</a> I thank you for entertaining that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8807.433s">I</a> do support the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8808.734s">I</a> just know that, you know, there may be questions that we get from the community later on. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8812.856s">It's</a> just making sure I can address those properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8815.058s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10861.69s">Councilor</a> Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10862.897s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10864.099s">I</a> believe this paper speaks for itself, and I'll let the chair speak soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10867.863s">And</a> I apologize that the second item on the agenda took us till 10 o'clock to get to, but I know they're very much used to these meetings, so I thank them for their patience. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10876.714s">But</a> I'm the council rep on this commission, and there's a number of <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10881.239s">community</a> members and business owners who've been working very hard, regular meetings, weekly meetings, and doing a lot of work out in the community to move forward a number of issues around this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10891.726s">I'll</a> hand it over to Jim and Laurel to speak on this more.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11326.212s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11327.293s">Laurel,</a> do you know where specifically on the website the link to that survey could be found?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11345.146s">Okay,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11345.687s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12973.372s">I</a> think we got it in October. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12974.692s">We</a> didn't get it in November. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12976.152s">And</a> then we're in December now, I believe, because I believe that the second month was missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12981.913s">I</a> think also it was, you know, cases were still at least on the lower end. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12987.254s">So</a> I think needing the update now is more dire.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13557.457s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14207.755s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14208.495s">I</a> know it's 11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14210.337s">on</a> the dot and you guys don't want to hear me talk about plastics, forks and knives right now, but I agree with Councilor Bears that this is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14219.683s">The</a> pandemic will recede, but the amount of single use and disposable items that has vastly increased because of the pandemic will not be gone anytime soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14229.229s">We</a> can't avoid the use of PPE, but there are things like plastic utensils that <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14234.552s">They</a> take about a thousand years to break down if they ever do. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14237.574s">And</a> I know many of us come home with plastic utensils from the takeout of restaurants in the area that we're trying to support that we simply don't need. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14244.977s">We</a> have utensils at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14246.058s">So</a> I think it's just a common sense resolution that just to minimize the amount of these that go out in takeaway bags that people may never use and just put in their drawers at home and eventually throw away and they end up in a landfill and never break down. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14260.344s">So</a> I move approval on this kind of common sense measure.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14577.989s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14578.789s">I</a> mean, this is in direct response to just the increase of single-use plastics that's come as a result of COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14584.393s">There's</a> a lot of, you know, unfortunately the meals that are not being had inside of restaurants are being replaced, thankfully, by takeout. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14591.757s">And</a> there's just, it's so much more plastic that does come with a cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14595.599s">It</a> comes with a cost to all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14597.14s">It</a> comes with a cost to future Councilors introducing resolutions when these forks and spoons are on the felsway dumped in someone's yard and we want to have them cleaned up. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14605.984s">I</a> mean, I think it's, this is actually a fairly, some ordering services, this is a common selection. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14612.627s">You</a> can select whether or not to have utensils. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14615.788s">I</a> know a few establishments I frequent in Medford actually do have this option, and it would be something that, again, just guidance, I imagine this is guidance as well, but something that when you're placing an order, someone on the phone says, okay, do you need utensils with that, as opposed to just, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14632.135s">Throwing</a> a fistful in but again, this is not something that we have the ability to really <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14639.62s">It's</a> not something we really have the ability to enforce, of course, but I think having guidance that people can look to and say, okay, this is probably just a way to minimize waste. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14647.924s">I</a> think it's, is there a direct response to the way the pandemic has reshaped the, and really to push back a lot of advances we have made in reusables and now has really increased the amount of plastic trash we're seeing, you know, as a community globally, everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14665.672s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14844.25s">Yeah,</a> because I moved approval because I moved approval and then Councilor Bears wanted to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14849.712s">So</a> I kind of jumped the gun on moving approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14852.053s">So</a> I very rudely moved approval before he could speak.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_TH89eXSxkYo/2024-11-19_TH89eXSxkYo.html">City Council 12-01-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=6087.482s">Councilor</a> Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=6088.583s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=6089.363s">Yeah,</a> I have a number of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=6091.865s">First</a> of all, we're looking, I guess, the main incentive to the community that is being touted, or really the only incentive, is the 250 permanent jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=6100.072s">What</a> type of wages are we looking at for these jobs?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=6119.132s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=6119.872s">And</a> then the permanent in this terminology, obviously it's not contract work, but what does permanent mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=6128.115s">That's</a> the entirety of the 10-year agreement or just to your best ability to keep these jobs that are being promised?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=6142.189s">I'm</a> not sure whoever can answer it.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=6167.353s">Okay,</a> and I'm sorry, the chief of staff's point, I believe it was, so these do need to, are required to be maintained for the 10 years? <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=6175.933s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=6176.634s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=6178.615s">Um,</a> and then, uh, another question. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=6181.257s">Just,</a> I don't, forgive me. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=6183.759s">I</a> do not know what unique meats and proteins mean when it comes to, to bakery products. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=6190.225s">And</a> we're talking about something that runs continually. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=6193.067s">So</a> 24 hours a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=6194.468s">Is</a> there any impact as far as, you know, smell exhaust odors, you know, to the, to the dense neighborhoods that surround this?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=6267.871s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=6268.191s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=6268.611s">And</a> then if I guess someone from the city or yourself as well, what is remind me that the square footage of this actual facility?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=6285.07s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=6285.33s">So</a> either to yourself or representative to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=6287.291s">So</a> this would qualify under the requirements of the solar ordinance that was recently passed in the city that I believe the qualifying part of this is that non-residential or residential projects which involve the substantial rehabilitation of a structure containing 10,000 square feet or more, a floor area, <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=6307.5s">or</a> the addition of 10,000 square feet or more of the growth floor area would be required to have the, I believe, 50% solar on the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=6318.965s">Is</a> that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=6319.505s">Can</a> someone from the city confirm that, or have you been looped into this?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=6399.668s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=6400.128s">I</a> mean, I would hope that $40 million counts as substantial rehabilitation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=6404.691s">So</a> I'm just curious to Mr. Modica, is this $40 million inclusive of potentially a solar array, should it be deemed possible? <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=6413.976s">Or</a> are there any other sustainability improvements that are included in this proposed $40 million rehabilitation?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=6491.136s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=6491.576s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=6492.436s">And</a> then my final question, if the chief of staff could confirm this, and I did, I had the opportunity to speak with Maria yesterday as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=6499.778s">When</a> presenting the benefit of this project tax-wise to the city, it is under the assumption that this benefit of $3 million is if no other company were to come in and not ask for a TIF, correct?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=6512.741s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=6513.201s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=6513.942s">That's</a> all I have.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9004.835s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9005.556s">I</a> don't know if this is a question for you or the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9007.818s">Does</a> council approval of this, is it a simple majority or two thirds vote?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9487.969s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9488.589s">I</a> just want to thank Councilor Knight for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9491.31s">Tree</a> canopies are a moving target with development, disease, and age. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9495.572s">And</a> as we look at the number of high heat days only increasing due to climate change, our tree canopy is more important than ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9502.874s">So</a> hopefully this can aid our very small, but very in demand forestry division. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9507.475s">So</a> I thank the council for bringing this forward.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9573.441s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9574.502s">Yeah,</a> this is just a simple request. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9576.004s">I</a> had a resident reach out about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9577.667s">A</a> number of cities have established these safe exchange zones for people purchasing exchanging items through Craigslist, Facebook and having an area that whether I know a lot of communities do it in the parking lot of police station or somewhere that <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9591.685s">They</a> know there is our cameras to add a level of safety so that people can support the circular economy, keep things out of the landfill and get them to new owners, but do so in a safe way. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9602.935s">And</a> noting that there actually has been some incidents in the past in Medford where people were going. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9609.882s">They</a> were lured by online sales that were not to be, I believe, over in Duggar Park a little, a year or two ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9617.57s">So</a> I think just seeing if the administration can see working with the police are the best way they see fit to establish this safe zone, promote it, and <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9627.58s">I</a> think cities, you know, just go as far as putting a sign up and letting people know where it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9630.885s">I</a> believe I've heard about this incidentally in the past, but if it's something that is still being offered, it's very hard to find. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9637.894s">So</a> it would be great if we could offer this for the safety of our residents and people looking to buy and sell online.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10008.863s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10009.624s">I</a> do want to thank Councilor Marks for raising this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10012.366s">And</a> yeah, I did have the resolution a few weeks back, really piggybacking on one of his previous to get an update on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10019.151s">And</a> this is the recommendation that came out. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10021.833s">And</a> I think it's worth noting that with our federal delegation, with Representative Clark, now Assistant Speaker, and her being a member of the Quiet Skies Caucus, hopefully she can hear what we're saying above the airplane noise and really be able to make some moves on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10037.046s">And</a> I also want to credit <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10039.007s">Our</a> representatives, the administration, the previous administration for taking the approach of working with our neighboring cities on this, because in the Globe today, there was a story about Milton and Quincy kind of going at each other as far as plans to mitigate their airplane traffic and noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10055.398s">And</a> I think moving forward together, hopefully, hopefully we'll get some movement on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=10060.461s">But</a> again, I thank Councilor Marks for raising this.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=4959.239s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=4960.5s">I</a> want to thank the mayor and her whole team for their work on pulling together and highlighting what Medford's done already in regards to much needed work on social justice, as well as plans for real change within the city to begin to address a long history of systemic racism, which is not unique to Medford, but unique in the fact that this has been acknowledged by both the mayor and this very body. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=4982.132s">So</a> this roadmap lays out a number of goals, and I just think it would be beneficial for the council and of course, <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=4988.483s">the</a> residents of Medford to get an update on some of the progress towards the goals outlined in the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=4994.344s">I</a> do want to note that shortly after submitting this item, I did get in the mail an update on that SNAP gap study, which is a reference. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5001.925s">And</a> I just want to highlight something from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5004.006s">So</a> this was completed by the Medford Food Security Task Force. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5008.246s">And</a> so for those who don't know, the SNAP gap, it refers to the difference between the number of low-income mass residents receiving mass health who may be eligible for SNAP <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5017.866s">and</a> those who are actually registered for SNAP. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5020.007s">And</a> the gap between those two numbers is 46% at the state level, and it's been found to be 63% at the city level. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5027.769s">So</a> I just want to note that because this is a number that's always crucial, but as the pandemic rages on and ravages people's livelihoods with no federal aid at this point, it's a particular problem at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5039.073s">So</a> I really thank the Food Security Task Force for their work on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5043.334s">And</a> the whole report is on the city website at this point, <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5047.056s">which</a> I think is just really helpful for people to know how this is being tackled with regards to the social justice roadmap, but just in general as this work is always important and ongoing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5058.705s">So</a> touching on just additional specific issues about, again, I think the mayor and the chief of police for their openness and willingness for policy reviews as laid out by the roadmap, but I do want to highlight that <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5071.461s">The</a> mayor did sign on to the Reimagined Policing Pledge back in June, and I know obviously it's a very busy time. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5078.183s">So</a> this is almost six months ago, and one key tenant of this pledge, which was formed to drive communities, it was formed to drive communities, and I quote, to engage in a public review of its policing policies and result in potential reform. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5092.066s">So</a> I think I just want to note the public aspect of this, as it's important to get an update for residents as far as where we are in this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5099.893s">And</a> also again, I just want to thank the administration once more for starting what was labeled as being a series of community conversations on race in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5110.515s">And</a> that first one was held in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5111.975s">And</a> again, almost six months later, we haven't had another forum on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5117.596s">So</a> it would be great to get an update on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5120.697s">And</a> again, I do acutely understand the challenges of a lot of this work as the pandemic continues on. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5128.472s">But</a> racism continues on within the pandemic, really, as BIPOC individuals overall have anywhere from a 1.1 to a 2.8 times higher rate of COVID cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5141.157s">And</a> also black Americans are dying at a rate 2.1 times higher than white Americans from COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5146.74s">So</a> this is just important work that it goes hand in hand with the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5150.641s">I</a> understand the challenges there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5152.942s">I</a> would also like to add in, <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5155.488s">I'm</a> going to see if we can also get a report out on the civil right. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5160.351s">Just</a> the sheer number of civil right complaints that have come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5164.454s">The</a> mayor did a great job in establishing this separate kind of submission way for complaints to the police specifically about civil rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5172.458s">And</a> I think it would be helpful as this council continues conversations on addressing systemic racism, just to get some of the data back. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5180.964s">So</a> just again, looking for an update and I thank the administration for <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5185.002s">their</a> work and putting together this roadmap and outlining some goals within it.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5416.348s">Oh,</a> I was just highlighting that Jackie had her hand raised.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_TKixPlxrhGc/2024-11-19_TKixPlxrhGc.html">City Council 11-10-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2162.903s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2164.183s">If,</a> through the chair, I could just ask Alicia just a few questions just to offer, I'm sorry, for clarity. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2170.085s">Remind</a> me of the deadlines as far as the CARES Act funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2172.525s">Is</a> it that services need to be rendered by that December date? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2176.486s">It's</a> billed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2177.226s">How</a> does that, I'm just trying to understand how that 2.5 to 2.9 applies as far as regarding, would that only be staff for before the break? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2187.008s">Or</a> if you could just offer clarity on how that money and the timing of how it has to be spent.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2197.388s">Okay,</a> so it would only cover personnel for the remainder, I guess, this term until the Christmas break?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2210.975s">Okay,</a> so just to make sure I'm clear on this, so that could not cover staff, that would not support any staff from January through the spring?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2232.13s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2232.51s">And</a> so, and do you believe you will, you're able to spend all 2.5 to 2.9 or will, might you come back and say, just due to what was accepted and what was available, we spent X number of dollars out of this?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3779.278s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3780.219s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3780.519s">I</a> want to echo my fellow council colleagues in that I, I understand the acute and immediate need for these items listed here, but there's, there are a lot of items with acute and immediate need. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3791.09s">And</a> I think just there's more information that this body requires before we can make a decision on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3796.295s">I</a> think as other colleagues have pointed out, just the understanding of which positions are new positions, which positions are, <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3804.122s">You</a> know, replacing something that was cut, which I think there's just a real lack of information here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3808.787s">I</a> do have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3809.888s">Um,</a> if through the chair for Miss Emily Benjamin, if there was consideration for any of this 700,000 to be put towards the schools and any of that budget, I know they had a bit of a larger hit than the city as far as cut. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3824.524s">So</a> I'm curious. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3825.745s">I'm</a> curious what the thought process was there as far as applying this entirely city side as opposed to looking at the schools as they're obviously due to the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3835.29s">I</a> understand there's a lot of money through CARES and everything else going to the schools, but there's a serious need there for support as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3841.574s">So</a> I'm curious the thought process behind that, why the funding is all on the city side versus considering the schools as well.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3916.029s">We're</a> not going to be able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3918.031s">We're</a> not going to be able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3918.932s">We're</a> not going to be able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3920.373s">We're</a> not going to be able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3921.274s">We're</a> not going to be able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3922.555s">We're</a> not going to be able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3924.437s">We're</a> not going to be able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3925.738s">We're</a> not going to be able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3927.259s">We're</a> not going to be able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3928.46s">We're</a> not going to be able to do that.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3937.89s">Sure,</a> if we could get a list of the city side positions that were requested in the previous budget and not funded exclusive of, you know, separate from the ones that are listed on this request. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3950.218s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6637.495s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6638.456s">I</a> just have two questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6640.277s">The</a> first for Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6641.138s">Cuddy.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6641.798s">So</a> you said that the MWRA is who is going to start work in April. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6646.261s">That's</a> correct?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6651.725s">So</a> National Grid will be starting in April? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6653.307s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6653.727s">I</a> just want to make sure.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6655.748s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6655.849s">National</a> Grid starts to work in April. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6657.089s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6657.51s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6881.495s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6882.235s">So</a> my second question, um, through the chair is actually for Tim. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6884.976s">I'm</a> just curious, based on the conversation we've had tonight, um, how often are these conditions that we vote for? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6890.979s">Do</a> we, does the utility come back and say, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6893.96s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6894.18s">I'm</a> not sure what you're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6895.221s">No,</a> thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6895.421s">Like,</a> is this an is this an aberration? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6896.442s">Or</a> does this happen commonly where we vote on something and then the utility doesn't agree to it?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6965.465s">I</a> understand National Grid's reasoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6966.766s">I</a> was just trying to get more information from our city engineer as we, you know, we see a lot of grants and locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6972.189s">I</a> was just trying to get clarity on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6974.59s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6975.231s">That's</a> all.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=8897.631s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9845.955s">10</a> or 11.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10286.157s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10287.238s">I'm</a> going to continue on the night's theme of pedestrian safety and safety, which I say in jest, but I mean, obviously there's countless intersections we could probably bring up due to people's love of Medford as a cutthroat to get many places, among other issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10303.451s">But</a> I know everyone here knows just how dangerous this area is. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10307.494s">It's</a> where Playset hits Winthrop. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10309.295s">You</a> have the cemetery entrance right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10311.037s">You</a> have the fells. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10312.698s">There's</a> a high, <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10313.999s">a</a> level of pedestrian traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10315.9s">There's</a> a high level of road traffic coming down 38 from Winchester. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10319.541s">The</a> cars just fly. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10320.702s">And</a> there are two crosswalks that are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10323.883s">They're</a> fairly faded on the north and the south side of where a place that hits Winthrop. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10328.725s">And</a> they may as well not be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10331.146s">Anytime</a> you see people out, people wait there forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10333.528s">Cars</a> will never stop for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10335.588s">On</a> the north side of the intersection, it is so incredibly wide that if you're lucky enough to have a car stop for you, <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10341.931s">Oftentimes,</a> cars will fly around that car while people are in the intersection, and it's amazing that worse hasn't happened there, considering how dangerous this is. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10350.699s">And</a> again, during COVID times, there's even more people out walking, biking, getting to the fells. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10355.163s">There's</a> more people trying to get through these crosswalks, really to no avail. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10361.348s">And</a> I did see that on the traffic commission agenda for this week, there is a request for a slow for children sign at around at around those same crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10371.038s">So</a> obviously people are concerned about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10373.861s">There's</a> a high number of school kids trying to get to and from in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10377.045s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10378.586s">not</a> for nothing, I realize there's a deer crossing sign in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10381.389s">So</a> all I can ask is if we've got a sign for deer, can we at least get a few signs for people? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10386.393s">I've</a> talked to Todd and Tim about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10390.216s">I</a> know this entire intersection is something they want to work on, but I really think we need to do something in the interim to just get some signs up to let people know about the crosswalks that are there so people have a better chance of getting across safely. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10403.848s">So</a> I move approval.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10487.087s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10487.808s">I</a> thank Councilor Knight for bringing that up because absolutely there is one bus that idles and creates a complete blind spot if you're trying to cross in one way. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10496.115s">Then</a> also buses make U-turns there, which I understand they need to turn around somewhere, but it creates a really unpredictable traffic patterns for cars and pedestrians alike. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10507.385s">Again,</a> it's a really dangerous area. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10509.668s">I</a> thank Councilor Knight for highlighting that.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_S_jvt8DRKHw/2024-11-19_S_jvt8DRKHw.html">City Council 10-27-20</a></h2>

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=8594.644s">When</a> were we told of the amount we were receiving? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=8596.486s">What</a> was the date we got the information about that $5 million? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=8601.087s">How</a> long have we known that we had access to that?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=8631.628s">OK,</a> but it's been several months?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=8670.774s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=8671.794s">And</a> then question for Mister Murphy. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=8673.135s">So</a> you were discussing mentioned essentially the $800,000 that I guess we're getting an update on tonight actually hasn't been applied yet because the cares funding is being applied in the 800,000 is being
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=8757.18s">Okay,</a> so if we're looking at this fiscal year, then it's conceivable the work, I mean, the school year essentially ends the same time around as the fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=8765.145s">So</a> it would be implemented or started or

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10547.756s">I</a> was just I was just confirming based on the numbers as far as what's been expended. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10551.959s">It</a> looks the size of applications for those completed at 67,000, you know, a little more than 67,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10559.183s">And</a> those pending, which are soon to be completed is 35 more than 35,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10563.126s">So</a> that's about 102,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10566.127s">Is</a> there money that I guess because you is there a more specific accounting for the money that's been spent so far?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10607.532s">I'm</a> just trying to so that the first allocation from the council is a 125,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10610.898s">So</a> I'm just trying to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10618.225s">expended</a> and is pending. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10621.067s">I'm</a> just seeing an amount of around $102,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10623.188s">And</a> that's correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10626.39s">That's</a> the full amount that's been. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10627.691s">OK,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10628.712s">That's</a> just what I was trying to get to. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10629.773s">Yeah,</a> I mean, obviously, I think, Roberta, for raising the fact of the state eviction moratorium expiring, I guess I would assume you anticipate more demand with that moratorium expiring. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10646.008s">that's</a> all I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10647.549s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11421.972s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11423.012s">Councilor</a> Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11425.334s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11426.375s">So</a> this report, I know it's, the report is dated September 10th through October 6th. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11430.959s">So</a> the 51 applicants and what time period, this was a month and a half that we went through 51 applicants or what was the actual time period for this, I guess?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11469.255s">And</a> were those applications, were they evenly spread out? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11472.538s">Did</a> they start to come, you know, have you had more in recent times as opposed to back in June or July?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11512.874s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11513.835s">So</a> would you anticipate this need would probably be at a faster rate or a higher rate than came through in the previous months? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11524.461s">I'm</a> just trying to see as we're extrapolating out the amount of money that's needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11529.104s">Do</a> you anticipate based on the trends you're seeing, understanding that the expiration of the eviction moratorium and people's concern about RAF, do you <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11538.77s">that</a> we're going to have a higher rate of these applications coming through.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11669.502s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11670.523s">I</a> just want to go on record. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11671.563s">I</a> think ABCD has done a wonderful job administering this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11677.987s">They've</a> adhered to the parameters set by the council, and I think they're being very responsive and understanding of really what we're facing in this state, what residents of the state are facing. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11687.232s">So</a> I would be in favor of the full amount, you know, releasing the full amount that's been requested, the $125,000, as opposed to a smaller amount and asking them to come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11697.824s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12838.517s">The</a> small grants are on the same paper, so would this be the 625 and both small grants?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12914.061s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12916.323s">Yes.</a>

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13543.27s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13602.624s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13604.706s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13606.728s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13791.119s">Yes.</a>

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=14562.649s">Yes.</a> <h2><a href="../2025-06-26_8oEn2KkMIiU/2025-06-26_8oEn2KkMIiU.html">Community Development Board 10-14-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=139.572s">And</a> Andrej, Jackie is on her way. <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=142.536s">She</a> is having some technical difficulties.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=543.514s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=544.554s">Would</a> that be a change to the subdivision plans?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=565.53s">Yeah,</a> and that would have to be a request to the board who would <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=569.855s">be</a> able to approve that type of a change, but I believe the board would likely want a recommendation from the city engineer on that as well.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=591.564s">And</a> you can actually coordinate through me in the office of community development and I can refer to him.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=709.69s">And</a> I'll just clarify that now that the road has been built to binder, it is the preference of the engineering division that the top coat wait until after the houses are complete for that to be installed. <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=723.097s">So</a> that's in, <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=725.825s">compliance</a> with their recommendation on that.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=855.063s">So</a> moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=858.105s">This</a> is Jackie Furtado.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=860.427s">And</a> I'll just clarify, that'll be the timeline for completion.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=1342.808s">So</a> there are a couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=1344.389s">The</a> rules and regulations of the subdivision of land that you're looking at, the last few pages of that have rules of the Medford Community Development Board governing organization and procedure. <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=1355.077s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=1356.197s">That</a> starts on page 34. <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=1358.518s">And</a> then there are also rules and regulations in relation to the site plan review, the board acting as the site plan review granting authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=1368.1s">And</a> that's what I had circulated to everyone to have a discussion about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=1372.041s">But</a> there are some other ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=1373.441s">The</a> subdivision ones are much older. <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=1375.001s">They're</a> from the 70s. <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=1375.742s">And</a> so <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=1378.492s">I</a> can share this if you'd like, share my screen if you want to look at them or I could distribute them after the fact and we could touch base at a later meeting.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=1444.016s">Yes,</a> if you are able to access the full folder of CD board, Medford CD board, there's a folder called reference resources and it's in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=1455.66s">I</a> know that sometimes if you're not linking it to your computer, it can be hard to get back to that main folder.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=1465.516s">Oh,</a> I'm happy to send it around again.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=1552.115s">And</a> I can also pull, the attorney during that meeting mentioned a couple of examples of neighboring communities who we thought had especially good rules and regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=1560.023s">So</a> I could pull those and distribute to you all.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=1656.52s">And</a> maybe I have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=1658.862s">Was</a> he saying that he didn't have a board at all.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=1688.613s">And</a> that may have just been for a site plan review, because I believe a planning board would still need to do subdivisions and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=1698.695s">Because</a> he seemed to say that they were doing a very good job with their downtown and using them as a good example. <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=1710.811s">I</a> don't know, that's what I got from his discussion, that part.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=1874.156s">Yeah,</a> it doesn't, it wouldn't go to them first, but we would be, if it requires variances, we make a recommendation to the ZBA.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=1885.174s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=1887.736s">They're</a> the same sort of time frame, like they could be submitted at the same time, and it could be under review by both boards. <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=1897.301s">But</a> the ZBA is supposed to wait for a recommendation from the CD board on that for the site plan review.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=2601.791s">Yeah,</a> I've been taking some notes. <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=2603.472s">If</a> you want to continue sort of throwing some ideas out there, then I could draft something and it could be subject to Andre's <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=2611.322s">review</a> and approval?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=2738.868s">That</a> sounds wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=2740.528s">I'm</a> happy to work with you, if you'd like. <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=2743.79s">OK,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=2744.17s">It</a> can be a group effort.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=3491.032s">A</a> motion is probably a good thing.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=3549.782s">Yeah,</a> may schedule the next one for the 18th.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=3595.095s">I</a> think something in mid-November would be better because that will give enough time for <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=3601.047s">some</a> of the Macklin road review by the city engineer and recommendation back to our board. <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=3606.192s">So,</a> um,
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=3778.905s">We</a> could do it a little earlier and do the Thursday the 5th.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=3911.791s">One</a> thing I did want to flag for you guys is, are we talking about a separate design review process or looping it in to a planning board process through the site plan review? <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=3924.04s">And</a> that may be a session for an attorney as well about what we can do.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=3935.602s">Because</a> I do believe that would require some changes to the zoning to build out what our standards for site plan approval are. <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=3943.649s">But</a> that could be a question that we bring up to Attorney Brobrosky.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=3971.66s">Only</a> that most of the ones I've been able to find are separate. <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=3974.881s">I</a> don't know exactly why that is or what the advantage is. <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=3978.223s">Some</a> of the materials Jackie sent were saying also that design guidelines should be based in the comprehensive plan goals so that they're defensible, so I think <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=3989.821s">this</a> may be something that comes out of that planning process. <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=3997.543s">But</a> it's really something that I'm happy to look into more.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=4014.447s">I</a> think it'd be good to get some feedback from, <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=4018.82s">the</a> city solicitor or attorney Wabrowski about sort of what our options are, but I think that it would certainly be helpful to determine what we might want out of the comprehensive planning process. <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=4031.845s">But</a> I think maybe, just from what I've read so far, it seems like there was sort of a need to base, to have some backup for why we're enforcing these design guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=4043.81s">I</a> don't know if any of you are more familiar with other communities where you've worked with design guidelines.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=4080.55s">Like,</a> well, and I also get a lot of calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=4082.853s">Yeah,</a> from developers in advance of submitting. <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=4085.756s">So</a> I think like an FAQ document might be a good A good thing to do anyway.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=4218.988s">Sure,</a> so what I have here is <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=4226.013s">Information</a> on what the recommended process would be for lining all of our different development review items up. <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=4236.181s">The</a> best opportunity for the community development board to weigh in or participate in this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=4245.087s">Some</a> more information that he mentioned he was going to look into on demolition delay and the historic process and how that fits in with his proposed changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=4254.006s">Any</a> opportunities for cross-reference to the City's Solar Ordinance? <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=4258.168s">Opportunities</a> to encourage energy efficiency and green building standards in the Zoning Ordinance? <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=4266.172s">To</a> what extent does he recommend design guidelines or a design review process? <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=4271.455s">Should</a> this be incorporated into the Ordinance or should we do it some other way? <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=4274.356s">And</a> the wording of neighborhood character and social structures. <a href="https://youtu.be/8oEn2KkMIiU&t=4285.038s">and</a> concerns about that and why he uses that.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_HIUEqVMOaUE/2024-11-19_HIUEqVMOaUE.html">City Council 10-13-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1553.817s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1554.737s">I</a> raised this at this time, make this request based on a number of things we've been talking about recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1560.82s">And</a> I do want to point out the fact that I know our engineering department and DPW does great work on updating our sidewalks and bringing them into compliance as intersections and sidewalks are updated, projects happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1571.925s">But</a> we've been having a lot of discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1573.546s">I</a> know Councilor Behr has introduced <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1576.107s">and</a> resolution last week, looking at our snow removal ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1579.209s">And</a> Councilor Knight brought up a number of salient points as far as the massive amount of work that our DPW has already and really could be doing to improve accessibility in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1589.757s">And</a> we've also had a number of discussions with a fine point on equity in the past several months. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1594.98s">So</a> I think when we're looking at all of these things, we have to consider our streets and our sidewalks and accessibility issues and whether or not they're actually accessible and equitable to everyone in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1605.427s">I</a> know the ADA is essentially an unfunded mandate, so it's really challenging for cities to do the amount of work that needs to be done to make sure our streets and our sidewalks are accessible to everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1615.032s">But</a> I think it's really important as we come around the calendar and start looking at another budget time to understand where we stand as a city as far as accessibility with our sidewalks and what work there is, also possibly what grants we've already pursued and plans to update as far as <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1632.82s">complete</a> updates that sidewalks will be brought into compliance because it's a massive project, but also looking at those sidewalks individually. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1639.423s">So</a> I'm just really trying to gather information so we can make the best decisions come budget time and making sure we're supporting work that really needs to be done in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1648.007s">So</a> I move approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1648.988s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1746.107s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1747.168s">And</a> I do want to point out, I know Councilor Marks introduced a similar paper back in June, but since then, so I think the last time we had a visit by Peter and Luke was actually, I believe, in October. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1758.382s">I</a> can't be positive, but I believe that was the last time we got the update as far as the number of <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1762.987s">different</a> approaches that were going to be presented to the FAA as far as dispersion and mitigation of the onslaught of air traffic over Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1770.514s">And</a> in the middle of August, August 15th, a decision came down from the FAA and they rejected all of the concepts that were presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1778.561s">I</a> know the mayor has expressed her dismay and <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1782.725s">I</a> think it would be really helpful to get an update directly from Peter and Luke as far as where do we go from here. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1788.169s">It's</a> my understanding from some outreach we've gotten that this isn't good, but we're not without hope. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1793.633s">So</a> I think it'd be really effective for the council to know what are our options after this rejection from the FAA. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1801.039s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=2116.294s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=2117.234s">I</a> want to thank my council colleague for bringing this forth and really echo what he said, where, um, not only we're in crisis right now and there's an even larger crisis looming. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=2125.058s">So</a> I really appreciate that our state delegation, um, is leading on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=2129.259s">And</a> I think it's, it's clear where this entire pandemic we've been trying to figure out where help is coming from different levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=2135.242s">And</a> I think it's very clear that it's not coming from the federal level. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=2137.943s">So</a> I think what we can do at the state level to, um, protect residents, uh, in Medford is really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=2143.585s">So,</a> um, this of course has my support. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=2145.786s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=2536.975s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=2538.075s">Yeah,</a> just two questions for Adam. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=2539.396s">I</a> know we had a resolution a few weeks ago as far as staffing in the elections office. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=2544.74s">And</a> I was curious if there's an update on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=2546.241s">I</a> know the mayor had also said that there is funding for part-time staffing. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=2549.724s">So</a> I was just curious if you have an update on staffing from now until election day or however it might pan out.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=2599.735s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=2600.135s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=2600.936s">And</a> then, um, do you have an update as far as, um, poll workers is, um, I guess need more. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=2606.459s">And</a> then if people are still interested, are you still accepting people who want to help out? <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=2610.081s">Um,</a> and what's the best way for them to go through that process?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=2645.835s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=2646.295s">And</a> I think you cut out for a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=2647.796s">If</a> they, if they want to be poll workers, what's the best way for them to apply or reach out about that?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=2841.608s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=2896.028s">Yes.</a>

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=468.027s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5252.247s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5253.387s">Thank</a> you, Marianne, for that extensive presentation and update. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5255.928s">I</a> really appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5256.828s">I</a> did have some people reaching out as far as you mentioned the two positive cases, I believe, with the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5262.97s">Questions</a> about, as far as maybe numbers for quarantining, because there are the positive cases and then there are the people who may need to quarantine, and obviously that would impact the number of <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5272.913s">staff</a> available to support the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5274.754s">So</a> I'm curious if the quarantining numbers, if that's something that can be shared or has been shared or any information around that.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5335.19s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5336.13s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5336.91s">And</a> thank you for that information about the flu clinics. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5338.971s">I</a> know you shared the date and time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5341.352s">Is</a> there somewhere on the website people can find that information, too, and if more flu clinics are offered in the future?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5361.278s">Wonderful.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5361.619s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=5361.879s">That's</a> all I have.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8496.946s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8497.667s">I</a> know, I think the clerk just referenced it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8499.289s">If</a> just someone from the administration could just speak to the, just out of clarity, just the intent of Amendment 1.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10835.97s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10836.91s">I</a> do want to thank the Historic District Commission and Mr. Goldschneider for their work they've put into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10842.873s">The</a> crux of it for me is what was raised before is that there is, unless we pass this Historic District Commission, there's really no authority to ensure that that compromise happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10852.898s">There's</a> no guarantee that that will ever happen if we do not pass this Historic District Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10857.8s">So</a> that's where it hinges on for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10859.581s">I've</a> heard from countless members of the community who are in favor of this commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10863.863s">I'm</a> sorry of this district and the only people I've heard who are against it are those who stand to profit off of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10868.766s">So</a> I'm in favor of this district. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10871.127s">It</a> has my support and I I just look forward to actually voting on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10874.97s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13818.083s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13819.163s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Bears for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13821.544s">I</a> think I appreciate you bringing this forward before it starts snowing as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13825.665s">I</a> think we talk often about how difficult it can be to cross certain streets in this city when you add snow. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13830.746s">When</a> you add those super high barriers of snow on the corners, you're now dodging traffic and having to hurdle over a snow mound. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13838.368s">So</a> I really think this is a conversation we need to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13841.869s">I</a> appreciate the wording and the attention to who should be responsible as this paper is written. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13847.732s">I</a> do have either an amendment or a B paper I'd like to offer. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13850.874s">I</a> know the city of Somerville references how wide a clearing should be, as Councilor Bears did reference. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13857.518s">This</a> is really an accessibility issue, whether you're with a walker, a stroller, a wheelchair. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13863.601s">you</a> know, a narrow path isn't going to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13865.602s">I</a> know there's some, some strange stuff with the profound number of private ways we have in Medford where there's a lot of non-conforming sidewalks in the first place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13872.684s">So</a> I do wonder if there could be language, um, just to talk about the width of a safe passage for consideration for mobility and accessibility issues, um, in the form of a B paper or an amendment.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13918.058s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13918.418s">Could</a> we add, I guess, the amendment would be to add to this discussion, focusing on the width of safe passage for consideration for wheelchairs, walkers, strollers, and anyone with mobility issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13938.563s">Do</a> you have that, Clerk Irvings?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16220.169s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17548.8s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17549.641s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17551.783s">I</a> am often in that area on foot on my bike and you can travel along the beautiful Mystic River and then you're dumped out onto High Street there with really no crosswalk unless you head back towards Giles Cross and you're still crossing multiple streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17564.775s">I've</a> seen people get trapped there multiple times. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17566.957s">And</a> I don't understand when you travel towards Arlington, there's beautiful crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17570.579s">That</a> rotary is very well handled. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17572.461s">But</a> when you get back towards Medford, it's a mess and it's a high traffic area. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17576.083s">So</a> I thank the councilor for highlighting this and pushing for action on this.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18746.807s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18747.648s">This</a> committee met. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18748.969s">It's</a> myself, Councilor Bears, and Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18751.13s">We</a> had a number of representatives from the administration where we were able to ask questions as far as what the city is currently doing to address systemic racism programs that exist under the umbrella of public health, the Office of Diversity, and beyond. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18765.3s">And</a> we heard from a few members of the public and voted to keep papers in committee to keep discussing this as it's not a simple subject to address. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18774.926s">and</a> move approval.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=19295.462s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=19296.142s">I</a> did reach out to the clerk with an amendment to the record, which I believe was shared with the entire council, so move approval of the records as amended.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5798.3s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5799.221s">And</a> I want to thank Ari and Adam and Jennifer for bringing this presentation before us tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5805.462s">I</a> appreciate all the hard work of the Historic District Commission to kind of get to this level of compromise that hopefully we can see through. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5811.744s">And</a> ideally, this is a model, you know, going forward that we don't have to reach at the 11th hour, but something that we can see how we can work together moving forward to really preserve, balance the needs of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5824.127s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6429.652s">Your</a> suggested kind of solution was we could do first reading, second reading, and then if something changes by third, we still have that option to- It's still a third reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6438.439s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6438.879s">We</a> still have the option to change should the compromise be met and things are satisfied.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7728.578s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7730.059s">Echoing</a> a lot of what's been said already, this is something that is long overdue, and I thank the administration for introducing this, highlighting the fact that, as Councilor Mark said, this is, it's a review, it's just that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7741.804s">It's</a> a long process that I think we absolutely need to start as soon as possible, and every election since I've lived in Medford, this has been an issue, and I think we owe it to the citizens of this city to move forward in good faith to do <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7754.17s">just</a> what this is, which is review to look at what we're operating on, and I support this measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7759.792s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8663.809s">Yes,</a> I think.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13445.824s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15510.623s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15511.804s">Um,</a> this resolution is pretty self explanatory, but this was raised through a number of channels that because of the, uh, indoor gathering limits, um, and another number of other limits, a lot of, uh, recovery meetings have essentially kind of disappeared or stopped happening during the state emergency orders in a pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15528.681s">This</a> is, you know, some, um, organizations don't have zoom licenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15533.605s">Some</a> are at the mercy of the <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15535.647s">where</a> the meetings are usually held and they're not reopening just yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15538.989s">So</a> I did reach out to the outreach and prevention team and they're aware of this issue and they did offer that they would do everything in their power to support 12-step programs that are seeking to meet as long as they follow state orders. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15551.296s">But</a> I did just want to raise this to ensure that this is top of mind for the administration and they're doing all they can to support local <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15557.279s">who</a> are in recovery and seeking recovery right now because it's really making a massive impact on these meetings and people seeking help. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15565.318s">So</a> I move approval.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15860.803s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15949.385s">Yes.</a>

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4564.669s">If</a> you can just add that to the motion, approve the Special Permit for Site Plan Review.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=6070.392s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=6070.872s">Yes,</a> this was before the board last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=6074.875s">The</a> Chapter 40A identifies timeframes that the council has to act on a proposed amendment after it's submitted to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=6085.182s">And</a> so the board acted, and then there were, I think, some Committee of the Whole meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=6090.146s">The</a> statutory timeframes weren't met. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=6092.267s">So</a> this is starting anew with a <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=6096.508s">a</a> new proposal that changed slightly from the last one and is back before the board because it's a new proposed amendment.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=6110.44s">The</a> BRUPA definition was a proposed amendment from the council in the meeting where they referred it to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=6116.398s">The</a> changes before that were a distinction in the C1 district about the number of barrels over seven barrels requiring a special permit, but under seven barrels being allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=6128.47s">In</a> the version you reviewed last year, it was all special permit CBA in the C1 district. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=6134.056s">And</a> then also barrel definition was added as an associated matter with that.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=6172.767s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=6173.127s">It</a> was the end of, I think it was July 31, 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=6176.948s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=6187.893s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=6188.134s">So</a> I can read that letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=6192.27s">So</a> this is to John Falco from Chairman John DePriest, August 7th, 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=6199.953s">Council</a> paper 19-481 proposed amendment to chapter 94 zoning to add two new definitions and an additional line brewery to the principal uses set forth in the table of use regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=6209.536s">Following</a> a public hearing conducted on July 31st, 2019, the Community Development Board voted to recommend that the Medford City Council adopt the proposed amendment with the following change. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=6219.912s">Add</a> the following after the last line in the definition for brewery. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=6223.597s">Quote,</a> the facility may also provide food that is produced on site, produced off site, or produced with food trucks that are located on site. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=6232.248s">Thank</a> you for consideration of this recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=6235.472s">John</a> DePriest.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=6276.337s">So</a> yes, the last one, it was special permit for all proposed breweries in the C1. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=6282.522s">Now</a> it's distinguished by size.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=6765.437s">And</a> just to clarify quickly, Andre, is this, this is the amendment as <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=6771.317s">The</a> proposed amendment as amended by the city council to include that.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=6891.706s">I</a> believe what she was going to say is that the city engineer has indicated that he can log back into the meeting if needed, if we have questions.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=11120.172s">Yes,</a> we will need to turn this around fairly quickly if the ZBA meeting is next week, but we could turn that around tomorrow and Friday.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=11157.806s">That's</a> acceptable to me, yes.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=13460.275s">Yeah,</a> you guys can make a recommendation.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=13804.606s">And</a> we may not need all of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=13807.147s">And</a> we can be in touch about canceling them if there aren't enough agenda items. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=13811.729s">But</a> we wanted to give you guys an opportunity to do some items that were not as statutorily required and as some of the development review we've been doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=13822.255s">Ideas</a> are welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=13823.801s">Right.</a> <h2><a href="../2024-11-19_ODT3XVbBhL4/2024-11-19_ODT3XVbBhL4.html">City Council 09-08-20</a></h2>

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=2436.48s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=2437.521s">I</a> want to thank members of the school administration for being here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=2440.664s">I</a> understand the acute and immediate need of the schools in this time as far as preparing for the safest possible environment, and I also understand just the need to be agile and responsive in these times, especially when metrics and goalposts keep shifting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=2454.758s">So</a> I thank you for your work on this, and I do hope we can move this paper forward tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=2458.942s">My</a> question is, <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=2460.624s">Councilor</a> Marks touched on this a bit about the HEPA filters, the $1,500 HEPA filters that are mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=2466.766s">And</a> I apologize if I missed this, but is there a ballpark number of the number of these we might need?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=2506.329s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=2661.917s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=2662.657s">And</a> then just one more question through the chair if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=2667.298s">Does</a> the assessment point to that these HEPA filters would then meet the needs or is there a chance we're going to put these HEPA filters in and it's tested again and we find that we have to go, you know, even farther as far as the HVAC and things like that?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=2739.73s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=2740.271s">So</a> really what I'm hearing is essentially it's just the nature of the beast because of the way these standards are coming down and just looking into the building this way, things are changing and sometimes it can be hard to nail down exact amounts because of that, but the intention is there as laid out in these papers and in the email we got, correct?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=4845.944s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Scott. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=4846.865s">Kelly,</a> Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=4848.186s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=4849.006s">Yeah,</a> I don't really think this is the appropriate forum to debate signs at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=4852.568s">I</a> move approval of both papers.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=4858.592s">I</a> move approval of both papers.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=6425.749s">Yeah,</a> Mr. President, if I could just draw attention to rule number 17 of the council, just upon debatable merits, a councilor shall speak no more than three times or more than 15 minutes on a single issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=6434.872s">I</a> think that's something that gets railroaded on this council often, and I just want to highlight that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=6439.933s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7628.643s">No,</a> I was just getting my mic ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7629.824s">Oh,</a> okay.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8726.987s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8727.968s">Yeah,</a> I know this is something that has been raised by Councilor Marks a few months back when these two lines, which are the express lines from Medford, were suspended, as we were told, temporarily in the earlier days of the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8740.177s">We</a> do have in our packet this week some back and forth from the mayor and Todd Blake with the MBTA, and the way the MBTA inevitably thanked the mayor for advocacy is suspending these routes indefinitely in mid-August. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8754.088s">So</a> this is especially concerning to me because frontline workers, which are going into work every day, are people who are more likely to need public transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8764.473s">And</a> we have essentially cut them off from these express routes, not we, the MBTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8769.556s">And</a> I did speak with our state delegation about this, and they are working on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8774.558s">What</a> they told me that we can do is really show a unified front on this, so I'm just asking moving approval on this paper to really demand that the MBTA reinstate these essential links and help people from Medford get on those express routes into Boston where they need to go get to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8791.114s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10033.257s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10034.238s">Yeah,</a> and I thank my fellow Councilors for bringing this forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10037.14s">I</a> know we all heard from many residents about this and I did, I think we've talked about communication on a number of issues around this and I think it would be beneficial and I'd like to add it in the form of amendment to get a report from the clerk's communication that can be posted on the website or shared in another way that just addresses how <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10057.076s">we're</a> addressing for this upcoming election to ensure that the mistakes that happened, and I know it has to do with volume and many issues, but that the mistakes that happened for the state primary do not happen again and people can have faith in whatever option or vehicle they use to vote for the November election. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10074.627s">So</a> I'd like to add that in the form of an amendment.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10871.165s">Mr.</a> President, I offer an amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10873.967s">Did</a> it get a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10875.748s">I</a> offer an amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10879.093s">You</a> offer an amendment? <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10879.933s">Yeah,</a> to knock it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10880.994s">I</a> can't remember if it's a second or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10883.135s">On</a> the main paper? <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10884.035s">Yes,</a> on the main paper.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13288.177s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13288.897s">Yeah,</a> this is pretty self-explanatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13290.899s">I've</a> had a few residents reach out about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13292.7s">I</a> know we have the dashboard. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13293.681s">The</a> dashboard is beautiful, but it does seem like there's a real opportunity at City Council meetings to hear from the administration, just a brief update about perhaps any changes, any different metrics, or how things are impacting things because I know we have, you know, it's seemingly every day that state unveils some new color map and what it means and, you know, the goalposts keep on moving. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13313.655s">and</a> changing so I think it would just be an opportune thing to have a representative from the administration just explain kind of where we are and any necessary updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13322.259s">So</a> I move approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13324.46s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13373.12s">Yeah,</a> I mean, I have the same question procedurally. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13376.282s">My</a> intention was just to get a response from the administration first and then understand how it might be introduced by them if it's something they're willing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13384.127s">I</a> understand it's, yeah, procedurally it's something strange, but it's strange times.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13409.272s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13409.412s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13409.692s">That's,</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13410.152s">I</a> would ideally, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13411.672s">Putting</a> this to the administration, seeing how they would like to deliver it via communications from the mayor, communications from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13417.273s">That</a> could be added if they see fit, if it's something they agree to.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13429.869s">I</a> mean, my intention would be to have someone to actually speak from the administration because there is stuff online. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13435.432s">There</a> is stuff already in report form and this would just be kind of anything that's worth addressing that week, that needs to be addressed that week.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13448.416s">I</a> see it in general as this being, you know, we have X number of people on the call right now, it just being that these are well attended and as opposed to having to hunt stuff down on the website and try to parse out data, just getting an update to say, okay, here's the numbers and here's how it impacts anything, or maybe it doesn't, or maybe there's not an update that week. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13466.026s">Maybe</a> it's not possible procedurally, but I think it is, it's information that's being asked for in the community and it's, this is a vehicle to provide it.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13495.781s">I'm</a> just hoping because we do have the dashboard and there are numbers there, but sometimes it's a certain amount of parsing out and trying to understand, you know, looking at one screen and seeing what the state metrics say and how we're supposed to behave based on those numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13506.867s">And</a> if we could get an update directly from the administration as far as our metrics and if it's changing any policies that week. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13513.951s">But</a> I do understand it's procedurally as far as being introduced as an agenda item, it's a little bit tricky. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13518.594s">So</a> my intention is just to deliver this to administration and get a response from them as far as how they might <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13524.897s">if</a> they would be interested in delivering such a thing and how they might want to deliver it, whether it's communications from the mayor or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13531.863s">But</a> I do think there is a benefit to having a representative from the administration when possible to briefly address this.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13543.572s">I</a> mean, weekly would be nice, but I think I also, I'd be happy to amend the paper to have the administration at a frequency they deem necessary.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13561.898s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13564.118s">If</a> we could add the language at a frequency that the administration deems necessary in the form of an amendment.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13573.42s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13573.86s">You</a> can strike that language. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13574.88s">We</a> can strike that language. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13575.74s">I'll</a> second that amendment, Mr. President.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13798.234s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13798.854s">I'm</a> curious if we could amend that to add to a date certain, because this demo delay expires in October. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13803.716s">So</a> we would probably want to meet before the expiration to actually have this conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13808.238s">So</a> make sure we do that in due time.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13824.027s">You're</a> taking it Wednesday, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13825.508s">It's</a> OK.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13893.063s">No,</a> I just had, okay, speak on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13894.584s">Okay,</a> so I'll thank you.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_qIvMl_-GSJQ/2024-11-19_qIvMl_-GSJQ.html">City Council 08-25-20</a></h2>

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8627.36s">is</a> to send this to subcommittee so that a deeper discussion can be had with experts in our administration, community members and council members. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8635.093s">As</a> these issues relate to our community, our history, and our city culture, my motion is to send it to the subcommittee on cultural arts and history. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8642.358s">We</a> don't exactly have probably the most fitting subcommittee that exists for this, and that's a conversation for a different time. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8649.622s">But</a> I do understand there's a number of items that are being kind of stacking up for committee of the whole, and this is a subcommittee that we could send to and ideally hold on hearing with all due urgency. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8661.837s">And</a> then that way we can report findings back up to the entire city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8666.02s">So</a> my motion is to send to the cultural arts subcommittee and I move approval.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8706.427s">Yeah,</a> hold a public meeting, yep, where we can hear from our experts as well as community members.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8845.719s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8846.499s">Yeah,</a> and I think Councilor Marks' point and I very much take that to heart. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8849.721s">And</a> I think that is <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8850.837s">and</a> one of the intentions here where we can hear from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8853.938s">I</a> know Chief of Staff Rodriguez reached out to us about a grant opportunity they're pursuing. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8857.859s">So</a> understanding things like grants that are out there, we have a lot of experts in the community that have reached out and offered to have conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8864.641s">And</a> I know they're at previous calls as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8866.841s">So</a> I think, I appreciate that and inviting as many people to the table as possible so that we can really work together on this and then bring stuff back to the city council that we can vote on and move forward on. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8877.164s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8973.448s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8974.508s">So</a> I've had a number of members from Medford's art community reach out about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8978.869s">So</a> the idea behind these percent for arts programs <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8982.391s">which</a> are usually put in place via ordinance is for community benefit and enrichment by having a decided upon percent of construction costs or fees of municipal capital investment to be designated for use for public artwork. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8995.793s">So</a> simple, they allocate a small portion of capital construction renovation budgets or something of the like for purchase, commissioning and installation of artworks that would be in the public space. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=9006.155s">This</a> is the first time to my understanding that this has come up before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=9009.016s">So</a> I think, <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=9011.128s">Again,</a> it would be another item that would be to send to the cultural arts and history subcommittee where we could talk more deeply with representatives from our arts council and other groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=9019.134s">I</a> know the arts council meets on Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=9020.776s">So</a> some of the members that brought this up to me are unable to attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=9024.318s">So</a> sending this to subcommittee so that we can discuss how a program like this could potentially work in Medford, obviously something that council would have to vote on, but just to again, study it deeper and report it back up to the full council.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=9996.257s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=9997.337s">I</a> believe this item came before the council at the last regular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10001.422s">I</a> think it was a pretty thorough discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10002.823s">It</a> was pretty thorough even though the agenda item was vague and many people did not know what was going to be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10007.828s">I</a> believe we voted to bring this up again at a committee of the whole.<h2><a href="../2025-06-26_r8QPRIQzk4U/2025-06-26_r8QPRIQzk4U.html">Community Development Board 08-20-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=394.666s">And</a> Andre, I just want to correct the record there that the building commissioner reviewed this, not the city engineer.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=5511.79s">And</a> I believe we've also received comments from the other grantee along the right-of-way at 555 Winthrop Street, so Lorena can read that as well.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6099.802s">I</a> also wanted to correct the record that that comment mentioned that Tim McGibbon had approved the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6105.206s">And</a> I just wanted to correct the record that that is not something that has taken place. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=6111.53s">And</a> maybe if you would like to speak to that.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=8638.597s">I</a> believe it should be a separate vote on the waiver.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=8910.135s">Sure,</a> I can do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=8911.356s">I</a> don't have the exact language that Robin has drafted so eloquently. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=8917.707s">I</a> may defer to her on those items.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=8937.337s">I</a> can go through a few items that are sort of more administrative. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=8944.593s">as</a> conditions that I wanted to run by board members, if this is an appropriate time for that.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=8955.077s">So</a> let's see. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=8957.198s">Prior</a> to endorsement, any changes must be shown on a revised subdivision plan, including a summary of conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=8965.221s">The</a> subdivision shall comply with all applicable standards and regulations as set forth in the Community Development Board Rules and Regulations, except for those for which a waiver has been approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=8979.308s">Consistent</a> with Mass General Law, Chapter 41, Section 81U, after the expiration of 20 days without notice of appeal to Superior Court or Land Court, <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=8988.624s">The</a> board shall endorse the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=8990.225s">This</a> endorsement shall occur following the provision of a performance guarantee in accordance with Mass General Law, Chapter 41, Section 81U, in an amount determined by the city engineer and approved by the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9003.214s">Said</a> amount shall bear a direct reasonable relationship to the expected cost of the work, including inflation necessary to complete the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9010.138s">The</a> amount shall be revised from time to time on recommendation of the city engineer to reflect the remaining cost of the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9017.022s">construction</a> of the subdivision improvements shall be completed within two years of the date of endorsement of the plans by the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9024.224s">And</a> this project is subject to linkage fees, city of Medford zoning ordinance chapter 94 sections 94382. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9029.265s">And</a> in terms of conditions recommended by <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9039.698s">City</a> staff compliance with conditions recommended by Timothy McGivern, city engineer, in a letter to the board dated August 18th, 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9050.48s">And</a> we've discussed the fire chief's comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9055.741s">So</a> I think adding the the condition, the reworded condition about the <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9070.809s">The</a> island in the middle, I need to look back at his comments specifically to see if, let me look at them now, if there are any others to include. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9080.813s">His,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9094.15s">Other</a> one was about the 12 foot right of way for access to 553, 555 Winthrop Street shall be repaved all weather roadway and shall be as wide as boundaries allow. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9106.478s">So</a> if that is a condition that the board would like to attach. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9111.022s">And</a> then the recommendation about sprinklers is this other one.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9174.125s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9176.243s">There</a> was a comment letter, a few of them, but the most recent one we have from Marianne O'Connor, the director of public health. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9183.65s">She</a> did not submit a new one, but she has expressed that her conditions still apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9188.694s">One</a> of them is to submit a written plan for proper dust remediation. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9193.018s">One</a> of them is a detailed solid waste plan must be submitted to the board of health and that dumpster permits must be obtained for any dumpsters prior to construction beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9203.343s">and</a> another that integrated pest management is required. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9208.864s">And</a> she goes into more detail on each of those in her letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9214.985s">And</a> then the other city comment letter that was not updated with the remand, but contains items that the author stated still apply is from Brian Cairns, Commissioner of Public Works. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9230.548s">And</a> the first two are, <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9233.146s">My</a> understanding and Tim's comment number 47 on this is that the proponent will be working with the engineering department and the DPW to address concerns about the water main. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9249.839s">So</a> that takes care of his first two comments that were about his uncertainty about the water main. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9261.712s">Hydrant</a> locations will be determined by the fire department, noting that one hydrant must be on Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9267.974s">The</a> minimum water main size is eight inch ductile piping and one inch copper services into the 10 residential lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9274.177s">We'll</a> also maintain a loop system around the property adhering to the 10 foot water and sewer separation. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9278.898s">All</a> standard testing for pressure and bacteria shall be in accordance with the DEP and AWWA standard. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9284.34s">Water</a> mains that intersect with other water main piping to the triple gated and open to the right <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9290.037s">All</a> water services will be placed in the sidewalk with shutoffs off the property line. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9293.479s">All</a> service connection on the old six inch water main will be replaced with one inch copper to the property line with new shutoffs. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9299.322s">All</a> as built will be reviewed by water and sewer and the engineering divisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9303.725s">Any</a> work performed on water and sewer must be inspected before backfilling. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9306.867s">Emergency</a> phone numbers must be provided prior to any work being done on roads in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9311.429s">Drawings</a> and pre-construction meetings are advised. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9313.75s">Any</a> contractor working on water services must be a certified drain layer licensed with the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9319.698s">and</a> these are all items that were responded to by Mr. Champion, I believe had all been resolved, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9328.606s">Except</a> for the water main that you were working with the city to accommodate.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9374.896s">Address</a> to the satisfaction of the commissioner of public works, his comments.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9382.982s">Would</a> it be appropriate to address to the satisfaction of the commissioner of public works to work with him?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9398.127s">So</a> I believe a lot of these were addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9400.088s">It</a> says triple gates are shown in the plan in your response. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9405.032s">You</a> commit to the utility contractor being on the city's approved list.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9414.979s">Pressure</a> and bacteria tests will be in accordance with the EPA and AWWA standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9420.923s">You</a> say the hydrants have been coordinated with the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9425.723s">and</a> that the plans have been modified to have 10 feet of separation, except at the crossings. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9430.065s">So</a> it appears that all of these were addressed.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9492.717s">So</a> you've reviewed and responded to each item in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9495.378s">I</a> just wanted to kind of have it on record in case some of these might still be outstanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9503.122s">So</a> it appears that you have addressed all of them from your responses too, but we don't have an updated letter from the commissioner.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9543.299s">And</a> I think lighting as well, you've addressed separately. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9547.34s">I</a> think another condition that was discussed was about notification to the- The blast plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9557.044s">Yeah,</a> a blasting to the director of community development or her designee. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9568.828s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9570.7s">Tim,</a> did you want us to add the vegetated area to the homeowners association for your comment?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=9608.186s">And</a> Robin has that language.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=13711.187s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=13712.448s">So</a> the Board of Appeals will be granting the special permit for site plan review as well as variances. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=13718.753s">So</a> they could open the hearing and continue both items if they have not received comments from the CD board.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=16279.953s">We</a> went 8-0.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8QPRIQzk4U&t=16478.697s">Good.</a> <h2><a href="../2024-11-19_XL6CFVX_DxQ/2024-11-19_XL6CFVX_DxQ.html">City Council 07-28-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=53.624s">Sorry,</a> I just, I got kicked out. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=55.405s">I'm</a> back.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2918.305s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2919.666s">Rocco,</a> thanks for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2920.547s">And</a> I know we talked yesterday about this, but I just wanted, if you could address just for the public and the rest of the councilors how the anticipated length of this work and project from start to finish.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2958.96s">Okay,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4328.548s">Okay,</a> hearing and seeing none, on the motion of councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4331.769s">I'm</a> sorry? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4333.87s">Sorry,</a> President Falco, I see Laurel has her hand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4336.551s">Oh,</a> yes, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4337.371s">Let's</a> see.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4555.517s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4760.918s">On</a> the motion of council night. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4763.999s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4765.119s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4765.88s">There's</a> a new hand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4767.54s">Joanna.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11468.459s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11469.719s">I</a> had a number of residents reach out to me about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11472.38s">I</a> mean, this harkens back to a conversation we had earlier in the night, where you can just insert street name, and I almost saw someone get hit by a car trying to cross here. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11481.043s">This</a> is obviously an issue at Wrights Pond, where especially this year, with the permitting being a little bit changed, you might have much more frequent entrances and exits, and people have to travel up or they have to travel down to the farther crosswalks, which they themselves are fading. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11496.793s">So</a> after introducing this, I did have City Traffic Engineer Todd Blake reached out and we had a conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11502.218s">It's</a> my understanding that the administration is looking at this as well as Representative Donato to try to find a solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11508.064s">I</a> guess there's a few mitigating factors that it's challenging to simply add a crosswalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11513.208s">And</a> I guess some other things have been held up as a result of the pandemic hitting. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11517.793s">So</a> this is something that the administration is working on, but I do move for approval.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11735.187s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11735.888s">Yeah,</a> I just want to add that I thank my fellow councilors for their design ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11740.27s">And</a> in talking with the traffic engineer and his areas of expertise, I understand that they're looking at the many ways they can approach this to be in compliance with certain ADA things, the sight line, all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11753.035s">They're</a> definitely working on getting creative to make this a much safer crossing, whether the existing crossings, <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11760.788s">adding</a> this crossing if possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11762.449s">So</a> I think the ideas are definitely there and to Councilor Knight's point, it's just making it happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11768.192s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12271.555s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12272.636s">Yeah,</a> I wanna thank Councilor Bears for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12275.097s">I</a> have a few comments on this if I could just read them off. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12279.4s">So</a> some people will say this is symbolism, and I definitely agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12282.583s">It's</a> symbolic of the commitments that we've made as a city, and this is the easy thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12287.728s">If</a> we can't do the easy thing, how will we do the hard work? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12290.89s">How</a> will we ensure that in 5, 10, 15, 25, 50 years, we're not right back here having done nothing of substance and learned nothing? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12299.535s">So</a> the uncomfortable truth is that for far too long, this country has said that Black lives do not matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12304.778s">Their</a> disparate health outcomes, their housing discrimination, and unequal rates of school suspension, arrests, and imprisonment. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12311.522s">We</a> say they do not matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12312.863s">We</a> said they do not matter by saying that all men are created equal, but in fact, not meaning Black men. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12318.188s">So</a> through chattel slavery, segregation, limiting voting rights, and Jim Crow, we have said that black lives do not matter, which is why we must now state unequivocally that black lives do matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12329.612s">To</a> say so is not a political act. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12331.853s">It's</a> a statement of human rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12334.073s">We've</a> declared systemic racism a public health crisis in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12337.675s">And</a> perhaps if we have a reminder in front of city hall every day, we will make good on the work that is needed to actually address this crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12345.057s">And</a> for this, I support this measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12346.778s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12348.561s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Morell.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=14960.745s">Hello?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=14961.686s">I</a> just found her and unmuted her.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15834.603s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15834.923s">Councilor</a> Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15835.884s">Councilor</a> Laurel. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15837.773s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15838.693s">I</a> just want to reiterate my point that this is not a political statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15842.395s">This</a> is about human rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15843.736s">The</a> Office of Special Counsel found that Black Lives Matter is not a political statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15848.318s">And</a> to say that it is a political statement is something that you're able to do when your life, your lived experience, your day in, day out is not impacted. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15859.404s">And</a> it's a privilege to be able to say, hey, that's political. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15861.925s">Whereas</a> for everyone else, for the people affected, it's a human right. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15865.087s">So</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=15866.608s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16777.507s">Mr.</a> President, I just have a question around clarity. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16781.35s">I</a> think there's the original motion, just moving for approval for the original paper, and then there's Councilor Marks's, which is to receive and place on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16789.056s">Are</a> those separate? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16790.377s">As</a> I understand, there's two motions out there.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18645.688s">So</a> we have Councilor Morell, then Councilor Knight, Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18648.671s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18649.832s">I'd</a> like to offer an amendment to this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18652.394s">We've</a> had a number of residents reach out. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18655.396s">It</a> seems that we're really remiss in not including a definition for brew pub in these additional definitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18661.288s">I</a> do have suggested language for that when the clerk is ready.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18671.357s">All</a> right, now I have to find it, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18675.58s">Now</a> I have to find it on my screen, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18678.422s">Okay,</a> a brew pub is an establishment that provides full onsite meal service and is also licensed to brew beer on the premises. A brewpub...
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18698.05s">Yep.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18704.334s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18708.857s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18709.918s">And</a> a brewpub shall sell 25% or more of its beer on site and <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18715.78s">Last,</a> a brew pub shall be categorized as a restaurant and not as a brewery for the purposes of zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18721.144s">There's</a> a number of other cities and towns, sorry, and then that's the end of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18724.726s">There's</a> a number of other cities and towns that have the same definition. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18727.889s">It</a> varies a little bit, but it's the same intent. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18730.791s">And</a> I think it's something we definitely need to add to this ordinance.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18916.593s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18918.094s">Councilor</a> Morell, did you want to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18920.216s">Yeah,</a> I won't withdraw the amendment, and I don't see why we can't add this amendment, and then it goes to the CD board and get their opinion on all of these pieces together. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18930.142s">And</a> just point of note, I was not on the previous council that failed to act on this.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20746.564s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Peers. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20748.465s">Councilor</a> Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20750.505s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20751.185s">I</a> just want to add briefly, obviously there's been a lot of talk about Medford Brewing, but I know so much, or at least a portion of the back and forth about the brewery ordinance was related to food. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20759.768s">So</a> I think this is also something that really addresses that and establishing that restaurant type. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20764.349s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22743.1s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Harris. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22743.98s">Councilor</a> Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22745.201s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22746.001s">Yeah,</a> I'll also be brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22746.961s">I</a> just want to add that as of yesterday, our seven-day average of new positive cases in the state of Massachusetts was the highest it's been in a month and a half, which is just to say, I mean, the numbers are still lower than many other states, but this is just to say this is very much an ongoing situation that we have to be nimble with. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22762.545s">So</a> I just look forward to getting that written response from the administration about plans moving forward and how we might adjust depending on the information coming out. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22771.348s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=23002.299s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=23665.762s">Yes.</a> <h2><a href="../2025-06-26_nqVIJ3wsDWg/2025-06-26_nqVIJ3wsDWg.html">Community Development Board 07-16-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=1289.741s">Andre,</a> I've unmuted John Witten from KP Law at his request.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=2796.551s">Sounds</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=2798.092s">Thank</a> you, Andre. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=2800.585s">I</a> just wanted to reiterate because, again, we do have three new board members, so I think it will be helpful for the applicant to present and sort of give a summary of this as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=2809.45s">But</a> I just wanted to give the high-level overview. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=2812.512s">A</a> lot of it Andre just mentioned, but I'll highlight that the petitioner is seeking both an approval of a definitive subdivision plan and a special permit for site plan review. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=2822.237s">And</a> both of those are for the 10-lot subdivision at 541 and 551 Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=2827.474s">The</a> original hearing was opened on May 15th, 2019 and was continued to September 11th, 2019 at the request of the applicant so that he could respond to questions by several department heads in their review of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=2841.445s">At</a> the September hearing, the board found that information necessary to ensure the access for public safety vehicles and the provision of proper utilities to ensure adequate water for domestic and firefighting purposes, sewage and storm drainage was deficient and thus the definitive subdivision plan was denied. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=2856.516s">The</a> board also found that the site plan review application did not meet site plan review standards relative to imposing undue burden on sewers, sanitary, storm drains, water distribution systems, or similar public facilities that could have been avoided by modification to the plans and the special permit for site plan review was denied. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=2872.348s">This</a> decision was appealed by the applicant and the project was remanded back to the community development board to hold a new public hearing in light of additional information submitted <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=2881.052s">for</a> consideration by the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=2882.934s">And</a> so revised materials were submitted to the board in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=2887.297s">City</a> departments reviewed and made some comments on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=2890.06s">And</a> as a few materials were submitted today as well, given that many of you may not have had a chance to review that, and same with the city staff as well, I think I would ask that the <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=2903.199s">to</a> go over those items, what has been done since the September hearing, what was submitted as additional information today, and kind of discuss where that stands in that regard.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=2928.851s">Yeah,</a> I'll find you. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=2930.092s">So</a> Ed Champey and JJ Richa. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=2932.834s">Here</a> we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=2935.116s">Unmute.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=2936.717s">Ed,</a> you are unmuted.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=3076.84s">Yeah,</a> I can share permission for that with a member of your team if they would like to do that.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=3327.802s">J.J.,</a> you are now a co-host.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=3330.811s">JJ,</a> can you... And you should be able to share now, JJ.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=5198.18s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=5200.501s">Could</a> you repeat her name again?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=5639.141s">Andre,</a> we have Renata Doros who would like to speak.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=6635.88s">Yes,</a> I'm going to unmute Peter now.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=6668.293s">Peter,</a> can I ask you to state your name and address for the record as well?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=6975.178s">Len?</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=7108.259s">That</a> would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=7108.84s">Let</a> me unmute you again, Mr. Libby. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=7110.661s">Your</a> street address, please.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=7158.101s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=7158.301s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=7158.581s">No,</a> go ahead.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=7369.862s">Annie,</a> do we have others? <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=7371.183s">We</a> have some comments that have come in via email and phone, so I'm going to turn it over to Ali to read those into the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=7379.384s">great.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=8906.931s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=8907.732s">Peter,</a> I believe, already spoke, so I'm going to go to Lev now.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=9986.011s">Looks</a> like the last one is Peter, who would like to speak again.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=12328.378s">First</a> is Navar.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=12553.416s">Alex</a> Lessenhop.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=12674.691s">Dan</a> Fairchild.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=12780.067s">Alexis</a> Smith?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=12903.307s">I</a> received one comment via chat here from Mina Sharma, 6th Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=12909.91s">And</a> they say, one, to clarify, does this zoning amendment override the zoning of apartment one, apartment two, et cetera, should be a holistic review as opposed to casual requirement in certain zones? <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=12921.574s">Two,</a> what kind of commercial slash mixed use parking requirements would be imposed on the new building and the neighborhood? <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=12928.317s">And</a> is that at the discretion of city council? <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=12931.161s">Three,</a> why aren't we encouraging mixed use versus forcing it? <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=12934.503s">Four,</a> in light of COVID and the impact of small businesses everywhere, does forcing, and that's where it ends. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=12945.511s">I'm</a> not sure if we can ask questions, but looking for clarification.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=13208.38s">Mina,</a> you should be unmuted.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=17125.47s">Andrew,</a> I think you missed the BJ's one.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=17925.71s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=17926.11s">Hold</a> on one moment.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=17937.869s">Okay,</a> you should be good.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=18389.697s">Jessica</a> Wall, you should be unmuted.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=19271.798s">Yes,</a> B. Dan Fairchild, you are unmuted.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=19329.235s">No,</a> none have come in.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=19960.991s">And</a> just to confirm, Mark, you'll work with me on an extension of the timeframe, correct?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=19974.679s">Great,</a> perfect, thank you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20008.297s">Yes,</a> I have unmuted Matt and Joe. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20012.239s">And</a> thank you guys for sticking around so late. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20016.763s">If</a> you want, I can just give sort of a brief overview of what you're asking for and the situation, and you can supplement it as you'd like, if that works.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20042.32s">And</a> the proponent is requesting that the board reduce that bond amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20048.923s">They</a> requested that it be reduced down to $27,774. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20052.944s">And</a> the city engineer performed a site visit and a review of their reduction request. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20060.668s">And</a> his estimate came back at $38,126. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20062.808s">So</a> he'd like the city to hold on to a little bit more funding or bond amount than what the proponent had requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20072.782s">He</a> said that this estimate includes a 20% contingency, but this amount could be adjusted at the discretion of the board if you would like. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20081.886s">So</a> the board is being asked to vote whether to approve or deny this bond reduction and sort of what the amount would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20089.97s">But</a> the city engineer's estimate is for 38,126. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20092.311s">And</a> the second part of this is that <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20097.501s">The</a> proponent had asked for the board's opinion on whether they could pursue full building permits. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20103.702s">And</a> I did get the city engineer's take on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20108.303s">And</a> he said, I take no exception to releasing the lots for full building permits. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20112.344s">In</a> fact, I prefer it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20114.064s">It</a> is nice to have the houses built prior to final paving. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20117.404s">It</a> also gives the binder a time to settle in reducing things like potholes and sub-base related cracking in the finish. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20123.846s">So</a> that's just sort of an update on that.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20512.484s">Sorry.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20532.049s">So</a> the main comments that I incorporated, um, were around sort of language tweaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20538.073s">And</a> one of the things was bringing in some language about, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20542.338s">looking</a> at the city's project review and the permitting processes and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20547.761s">So</a> I tried to expand some of the areas to include that so that when the consultants come back, they'll know that they're looking at that as well, rather than just making a plan and looking at the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20562.968s">We</a> also want to understand the city's processes and what is included in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20568.271s">I</a> added some language around <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20571.262s">strengthening</a> that public outreach piece and the public participation and really marketing the plan and making that a focus of how do we get responses from the community and how do we make sure all different parts of the community know that this is happening and are able to participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20590.253s">I</a> added some language that Christy sent about broad goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20597.07s">And</a> maybe I can actually just read those two. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20599.052s">There</a> are a few different areas where the RFP talks about goals and things, but this was an interesting sort of overarching goals of both the comprehensive plan and the phase two that would look at kind of the zoning and the processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20615.426s">And</a> it's to document a clear vision, connect a public investment in that vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20620.339s">connect</a> regulation to that vision, create a roadmap for thinking and acting from a comprehensive perspective and providing an excellent system for project review. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20629.031s">So</a> kind of bringing that comprehensive plan from theoretical down to like, what does this mean systems wise in the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20637.113s">So</a> those were sort of, and then some changes to some wording around placemaking, walkability, things like that.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20651.646s">We</a> have an online permitting system. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20655.389s">The</a> city launched it right at the start of COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20660.634s">Right</a> now, it's mainly just being used for building permits. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20664.931s">it</a> will be built out at some point to encompass the rest of it, but right, that's still sort of in flux, in process. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20672.793s">So</a> that's, I could mention that specifically if you want, but there is a software that the building department has committed to and is being trained on and the other department heads are being trained on. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20682.115s">So</a> I think that's sort of in progress.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20696.07s">That</a> is also in progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20697.431s">The</a> assessor's office is, there's a consulting firm making that for them.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20743.479s">Yeah,</a> so that's in progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20745.079s">And</a> then I would assume that part of since phase one is sort of the comprehensive plan and phase two is more looking at the <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20753.469s">the</a> vision and goals from the comprehensive plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20755.791s">What</a> do we need to change in the zoning? <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20758.473s">What</a> do we need to change in our processes to get there? <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20762.356s">And</a> so that I would envision would include an update to that digital zoning map to reflect any zoning changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20770.083s">But</a> also the engineering department will sort of take ownership of that map once it exists. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20775.647s">It'll</a> be a GIS layer that can actually be edited and changed and exists already.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20884.011s">Yeah,</a> I guess there's sort of two terms. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20886.674s">In</a> my mind, there's like the term <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20888.708s">of</a> like when you do the plan, but if it should be looking farther than that, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20894.329s">There</a> was some language about 10 to 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=20897.37s">That's</a> something that I think if you guys have any input on, but there might be some things that wouldn't necessarily happen in 10 years that you might wanna start initial steps for or be planning for in a comprehensive plan, maybe.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=21417.887s">I</a> can take a stab at adding some language about what I'm hearing is... <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=21424.196s">It'd</a> be kind of a 10-year plan, but with a piece that is looking long-term, a long-term visioning piece that really focuses on where do we want to be in 30 years or so, and takes into account climate and key development areas and all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=21440.211s">But</a> the plan itself and the action items would be focused on that 10-year timeframe. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=21445.435s">Other</a> things to emphasize will be making sure the plan has key performance indicators or some way to measure the success of implementation over time.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=21471.405s">So</a> I could try to add some of that language in, send out the link again when that's been done and maybe give you guys a week or so to review it and send me any final comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=21487.416s">And</a> with the expectation that we would put this out prior to the next meeting, so we wouldn't have another group conversation about it.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=21716.674s">All</a> right, is there a motion on the... I'm jinxed, that's Andre.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=163.953s">Point</a> of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=167.055s">For</a> what purpose?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=175.902s">On</a> the motion of, I'm sorry, Councilor Morell, I missed what you said, I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=179.884s">I</a> was just seeing if there were specific papers, if they could reference the specific papers they want to take out under suspension.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=507.821s">Just</a> a point of clarification that the president had previously met and addressed a previously voted on resolution and more than 200 individuals have come out to previously scheduled meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=518.775s">So</a> I just want that to be on the record.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=669.791s">Thank</a> you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=671.452s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=673.273s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=674.074s">Is</a> the motion to table this resolution, or is the motion to amend this resolution?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=829.128s">Point</a> of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=831.61s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=833.592s">The</a> paper that's being discussed does not reference Zoom, and that's why it's coming up.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1614.056s">There's</a> just a group and an organization that keeps on being referenced. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1617.058s">I'm</a> not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1618.219s">I</a> don't understand who's being referenced or being addressed.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1764.206s">I'm</a> glad everybody thinks this is funny. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1766.32s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1768.461s">I</a> do want to note that I do get frustrated by Zoom sometimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1771.622s">I've</a> had a few times where I've had my hands up. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1774.023s">And</a> I know when we have such high attendance, it's hard to see everyone with their hand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1777.685s">And</a> it's a little different if we're in the chambers and I were able to push the button and get online. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1781.786s">But</a> these are things that have to be done because we are still very much in the middle of a pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1786.308s">I</a> know things are being shared about how many budgets people have done. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1790.29s">This</a> is my first budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1791.85s">But</a> like every other Councilor, this is my first budget during a pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1796.072s">I've</a> only lived in Medford for seven years, but I've lived here long enough to hear the phrase Medford is not XY or Z city. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1802.513s">So</a> while I appreciate that the city of Canton met in person, I think we as Medford can identify a way to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1809.335s">One</a> way actually has been previously identified. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1811.515s">I</a> have been at the meetings, but I do welcome the president's absolute willingness to work with every Councilor and lead on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1820.357s">the</a> fact that many members of the public and members of the council and department heads and the administration have been on three budget meetings that did not go on. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1830.38s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1918.942s">The</a> resolution being discussed wasn't on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1921.323s">It</a> was submitted under suspension.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1987.949s">I</a> will stop after this, but I just want to say that I have very much respect to this, this council on this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=1993.314s">And</a> that's why I showed up to the three budget meetings.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2763.953s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2765.334s">Director</a> Nunley, so I know we've talked in previous meetings just about amounts or ratios for things like free cash that's preferred to have in the account. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2773.14s">Does</a> something like this exist in this type of account that's a recommended amount or ratio? <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2778.064s">I</a> know you said you feel comfortable with this amount, but I don't know if there's anything else.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=3325.975s">Mr.</a> President? <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=3327.016s">Yes,</a> Council Member. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=3328.096s">Are</a> you looking for physical hands, hands in the Zoom, either or?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=4223.668s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=4224.068s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Raul. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=4227.271s">I'm</a> actually in my office, not my bedroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=4229.092s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=6912.522s">Point</a> of information.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=6916.843s">I</a> just want to clarify that the phases of the reopening are not set by the belief that COVID is no longer a threat. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=6924.089s">It's</a> based on the fact that there's now room in the hospital should more people get ill to that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=6928.63s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14854.028s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14854.708s">I</a> just wanted to address the first question. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14856.589s">I</a> mean, it's endless work as far as, and ongoing work as far as bias and anti-racism. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14862.85s">So,</a> I mean, I've got <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14864.347s">books</a> on the bookshelf. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14865.308s">You</a> know, I've got the, the new Jim Crow. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14867.209s">I've</a> got how to be an anti-racist. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14868.669s">And</a> there was a great event from the Boston Globe with the author of how to be an anti-racist last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14874.613s">That</a> was great. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14875.093s">So</a> those are just some highlights. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14877.094s">And</a> number two, I'll be specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14879.595s">When</a> I ran my first sign meeting as chair of the science subcommittee, Councilor Scarpelli was very giving of his knowledge and his time to help me run that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14888.14s">And</a> I'm very appreciative of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14889.401s">And</a> I continue to be appreciative of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14890.862s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=16767.206s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=16768.466s">So</a> this is just a resolution simply to take this paper back up. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=16772.947s">It</a> was originally introduced as 19-312 in the last session to establish a women or gender equity commission in the city of Medford by ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=16782.63s">So</a> I've gotten much outreach over the past few months about this potential commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=16786.47s">And</a> I think now with so many people looking for <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=16789.535s">ways</a> that they can be involved in what goes on at City Hall and lead Medford forward in these times. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=16795.897s">I</a> think it's important that we advance it and bring it back to a committee of the whole to work out kind of the final issues around the ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=16802.94s">There's,</a> of course, the intersectionality of issues of race, gender, and class that this commission would definitely focus on and advance forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=16810.042s">And</a> I think it's a much needed <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=16813.126s">ordinance</a> at this time, as well as to have these conversations going forward so I it's just a motion to have this taken up at a future committee of the whole console moral Thank you for bringing this forward on this actually is on our list.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=17086.706s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=17087.646s">Yeah,</a> I just want to echo Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=17089.707s">For</a> those who were able to attend the conversation on racism event online last week, this is something that came up repeatedly, issues with communication as far as them needing to be more equitable, <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=17099.866s">and</a> just a first step to making sure voices are heard from the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=17105.888s">So</a> if this council is about action, this is a great first action we can take to really address some of the inequities that exist and not to call anyone out, but to the gentleman who struggled to find tonight's council agenda on the website, so did I. So there's obviously a lot of room for improvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=17121.552s">So</a> I look forward to that and I support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=17123.193s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=17410.095s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=17410.915s">Yeah,</a> I just want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=17413.516s">I</a> think this is a great opportunity to support our local businesses and their efforts for outdoor safe dining, and then also a great way to reimagine Medford and get some ideas to make us a much more multimodal city. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=17426.361s">So</a> I support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=17427.762s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=17576.917s">In</a> efforts of working equitably moving forward, I found them stupendous.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=17624.853s">If</a> I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=17626.054s">Councilor</a> Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=17626.814s">Mr.</a> President, I just want to note that we're just a few minutes shy of midnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=17631.217s">We've</a> got 93 people on the call. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=17632.537s">So</a> I want to thank everyone for coming out and sticking with us.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_zUQub31GJNs/2024-11-19_zUQub31GJNs.html">City Council 06-16-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=624.059s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=626.519s">Councilor</a> Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=628.339s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=629.76s">So</a> I thank Vice President Caraviello for bringing this forward, but I just have one concern with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=634.54s">So</a> it was my understanding that at our most recent budget update, our independent auditor suggested that we use the free cash a certain amount, I think, <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=643.865s">$6</a> million or somewhere around there was referenced. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=646.726s">Obviously</a> that's up to the mayor, but because we could get enough local receipts back to bring us back to the level we're at now and maintain our bond rating. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=655.667s">So</a> considering cuts are already being made that have been referenced and the fact that school will be much more expensive to run, it doesn't seem to me to be in the best interest of our city and our schools to then take any money we might get from a bailout and put that back into free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=672.455s">I</a> feel like because the independent auditor said we're able to get back up to a good level with the receipts coming in, that money that, you know, again, we don't know if this money is ever coming, but if it does come, that be put back in to make up for those cuts that are already happening and bring people on and secure people's jobs and make sure our school is prepared and our city services are prepared for this coming fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=695.37s">So</a> unless it's amended, I can't vote for this at this point, just because I don't think <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=701.379s">that</a> taking that money and not applying it where it's most needed is the most prudent decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=707.123s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=906.286s">Councilor</a> Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=907.504s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=908.264s">Yeah,</a> I just wanted to clarify what I was saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=909.845s">I'm</a> not saying I'm going to vote against the mayor using free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=912.667s">What</a> I'm saying is the way this current resolution is written, the second part I do disagree with because I think if a federal bailout or a state level bailout or something comes down, that money should then be applied to the cuts that have already been made and to secure positions within the schools in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=930.015s">So</a> that's where my level of disagreement is. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=931.676s">I'm</a> not going to vote against <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=933.424s">free</a> cash, but just the way this resolution is written, I don't agree with the second part. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=937.987s">So</a> I just want to clarify that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=939.348s">So</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=940.429s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=941.329s">Councilor</a> Marks.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=4061.083s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=4062.684s">Like</a> my fellow councilors, I've received more than 100 emails in the past week plus with residents seeking information <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=4069.342s">related</a> to questions as far as what our police and Medford are doing to ensure the safety and support of all members of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=4077.088s">And</a> more specifically, what the current practices and policies of our police are, and how they might relate to recent policy suggestions that work to stop police violence and stop police killings throughout this country. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=4088.557s">So</a> my intention with this is to send it to the public safety subcommittee for a future meeting held with all urgency. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=4094.753s">where</a> the chief of police can attend and address these questions, as well as allow the subcommittee members and the public to ask more specific policy questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=4103.437s">I</a> did talk to the chief earlier last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=4106.318s">It's</a> my understanding that he's working on a public document to address a lot of these questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=4110.24s">But</a> I do think this is something that needs to be taken up in a subcommittee so that we can have more specific questions and conversation around this. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=4117.623s">I</a> do understand there's a <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=4119.268s">Similar</a> type motion, but I think this is something that we need to address as a subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=4123.211s">And</a> I move for approval to send the paper there.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=5546.273s">Councilor</a> Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=5547.734s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=5549.035s">And</a> thank you, Councilor Bears for putting so much of that into a statement and putting it so well. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=5553.658s">So</a> you alluded to this, but I'm gonna start by reading off a few statistics. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=5557.481s">So</a> black Americans are nearly three times more likely than white Americans to be killed by police. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=5563.421s">Black</a> women die of pregnancy related causes at a rate about three times higher than those of white women. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=5568.865s">Black</a> Americans are dying of COVID-19 at a three times rate of white Americans. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=5574.47s">And</a> black Americans face a higher risk of particle pollution than white Americans, which recent research has shown ties into the severity of COVID-19 cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=5583.857s">All</a> of this does nothing to speak of the immense mental health toll of systemic and structural racism on black Americans. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=5590.89s">These</a> are just a few highlights of the so-called social determinants of health. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=5595.113s">So</a> to me, as has been referenced already by Councilor Bears, it's incredibly apparent that structural and systemic racism is a public health crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=5602.899s">Saying</a> so follows in line with statements of the American Medical Association, the American College of Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Public Health Association. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=5613.387s">However,</a> simply naming this emergency does not get the work done. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=5617.71s">I'm</a> committed, as I hope are my council colleagues, <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=5620.388s">to</a> work within our power and alongside our colleagues on the school committee and in the administration to work within our system and our structures to break down the systemic and structural racism that exists within this city and within this country. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=5635.161s">And</a> I think the mayor, I had a line about us not being able to advance this work on our own. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=5639.124s">So</a> I thank the mayor for coming out and supporting this statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=5643.468s">And</a> that will allow us to dedicate resources and time to eradicate this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=5649.21s">And</a> I also speak to the fact that I received probably more than 100 emails from community members around this, from residents seeking change and conversations that have needed to happen for decades that we cannot and should not ignore any longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=5663.779s">So</a> again, this resolution is not the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=5666.06s">It's</a> asking for the work to begin and inviting our colleagues throughout city government to work on this intractable challenge. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=5672.785s">And</a> I ask my fellow Councilors to support this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=5675.906s">And</a> again, I thank the mayor for coming out with her declaration. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=5678.941s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7833.115s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7835.577s">Councilor</a> Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7837.017s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7837.778s">Yeah,</a> and I will just be brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7839.538s">I</a> just want to echo what Councilor Bears was saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7841.339s">This</a> is a starting point. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7843.982s">It</a> feels silly to say naming the problem because this is something that has existed since the beginning of our country. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7850.306s">And</a> as Marianne O'Connor said, this is a known issue, but it's naming it and it's starting these conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7857.032s">And</a> absolutely, as I said, when I introduced this, this is not the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7862.656s">The</a> work starts from here. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7864.237s">This</a> is naming where we have to go from here. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7866.719s">And</a> again, as Councilor Behr said, this is responding to a direct call from the Massachusetts Black and Latino Legislative Caucus <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7873.365s">I'm</a> encouraging us to do this, to do this action. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7877.008s">This</a> is one of the many actions they're encouraging. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7879.17s">So</a> I'm trying to listen to those voices and move off that. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7881.973s">And</a> I want to, I'll stop talking as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7884.014s">I</a> want to give time for people to talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=7885.596s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=9282.425s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=9283.306s">I'm</a> not trying to delve too deep into this topic, but I think we need to watch carefully when we're asking people of color to do the unpaid labor of educating us. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=9292.389s">Racism</a> is something white people had a very good part in, and I think we could definitely think of some ways we can do better by it, and not asking people of color in Medford to answer all of our questions and do all the work for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=9307.255s">So</a> I just want to <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=9308.206s">that</a> on the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=9309.026s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_zC2BsNwhExU/2024-11-19_zC2BsNwhExU.html">City Council 06-02-20</a></h2>

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=4942.421s">I</a> can see George moving. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=4945.103s">We</a> lost you for about maybe 15 seconds, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=4949.626s">Okay,</a> figures. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=4952.309s">But</a> as I was saying, I'll pick up somewhere in the middle, but the... Are you guys frozen again?

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8817.937s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8819.078s">This</a> one's pretty self-explanatory, but in recent days, we've seen Malden, Everett, Somerville earlier, Cambridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8825.96s">We're</a> surrounded by cities that have expanded their testing for their residents or universal testing for residents through partnerships with different health organizations or hospitals. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8836.543s">And</a> I think as there is talk at the state level of what these phases are going to look like as we work towards eventual reopening, <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8844.909s">I</a> think we need to take a serious look at testing for our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8850.132s">As</a> of last week, they updated the numbers and out of 351 cities and towns, Medford is still around 22 as far as rates of coronavirus cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8858.297s">So</a> I think this is something really important that we need to get an update from the administration on and understand where we are in this.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=5847.218s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=5848.239s">Yeah,</a> I want to thank everyone who brought this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=5850.94s">I</a> know this was put together with some amount of speed because this is what's necessary at these times. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=5856.961s">This</a> crisis is happening in real time and people's needs are happening in real time and different levels of government can act at different levels of speed. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=5864.606s">And</a> I think we need to respond to this as much as we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=5868.128s">This</a> crisis impacts people differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=5869.969s">A</a> lot of us are fortunate enough to be able to work from home. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=5872.59s">We</a> continue our work and we don't notice it. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=5874.752s">There</a> are people that this is making a huge impact on. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=5878.017s">22</a> million people applying for unemployment throughout the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=5880.779s">These</a> are incredible numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=5883.581s">And</a> I think we're going to see the demand. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=5885.242s">And</a> I think there's been a lot of questions about an agency like ABCD facilitating this. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=5889.824s">And</a> I think those questions have been answered and addressed in the sheer scope of the challenge and the fact that ABCD goes farther to follow people and help them really in the ways they need to be helped when they do qualify for these programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=5903.392s">My</a> father led one of the sister organizations to ABCD for the entirety of his career. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=5907.993s">And</a> I've seen how this impacts communities, how it impacts people who need these programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=5913.015s">And</a> I have all the faith in programs like ABCD to facilitate these things and to help people and to do the vetting and to make sure that Medford is put first. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=5922.517s">And</a> to the point that has been made before, if we don't do this, nothing's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=5927.139s">Of</a> course, there is a small amount of risk as we kind of build the plane as we're flying it, but we're in unprecedented times. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=5932.95s">And</a> I think this is something that we do need to move forward with to help Medford families and to offer something for people who are really struggling right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=5941.097s">So</a> I look forward to supporting this. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=5943.94s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Morell.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1222.22s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, just since this was reprinted just from the original meeting where I had the erroneous information the current cap is at 40,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1231.006s">But</a> in short, this is a program, as you read it allows seniors meeting certain criteria and the city, and under an income cap to defer their real estate taxes until they either sell their home or pass away. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1245.41s">And</a> currently our cap sits at $40,000, and the idea was to raise this. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1250.954s">We're</a> able to raise this as high as the senior circuit breaker tax income credit. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1256.679s">And</a> I believe for fiscal year 21, that would be $60,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1261.162s">We,</a> by voting on this now, would go into effect for fiscal year 21. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1266.687s">So</a> it came up last year, last year, last week, the idea of a $50,000 cap. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1271.731s">I</a> think originally we were all thinking of doing more, but in light of <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1275.364s">to</a> raise the cap to $50,000 for fiscal year 21.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1362.528s">I</a> mean, as the statute is written, it says just, it says by a vote of the council alderman, whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1371.319s">I</a> spoke, the clerk has his hand up.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1432.293s">But</a> as I said, as the state statutes ran it, the wording I believe is by a vote of, it can be said by a vote of. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1440.299s">It's</a> actually fairly kind of a... I was just gonna say if we wanna pass this resolution and then we have the committee reports at the end of the meeting to the correct point, whether it's through the... <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1459.198s">this</a> resolution or adopting the committee report, it seems like we should have our bases covered. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1464.521s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Morell.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1578.191s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1579.012s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1579.352s">And</a> it honestly, it might get lost during this time anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1582.874s">So</a> perhaps closer to when the deadline is for the program.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1587.678s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1589.179s">Councilor</a> Marks.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1650.423s">The</a> deadline's actually april 1st of next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1652.905s">Okay,</a> so if we sent it out in the next tax bill, everybody should have a correct That's the bill that everybody gets that owns homes Yeah, and it may be I mean i'm fine leaving uh it as um, just saying a future bill and perhaps deferring to the assessors when it would be <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1673.022s">be</a> most beneficial or there's not other stuff that has to go out as well to send it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1678.863s">I</a> mean, we can conjecture as far as what people might do if they get it in there six months from now, whether they'll lose that paper and forget about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1686.005s">So</a> I'd be happy to just defer to the administration.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1694.167s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1694.767s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1695.727s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1806.545s">I</a> can address it if... Sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1810.626s">So</a> the question is, so this item will be deferred until April 1st question. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1815.147s">So</a> the deadline for fiscal year 2020 was <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1820.903s">April</a> 1st of this year, and we would have had to set the rate actually by the end of the previous fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1826.528s">So</a> we have to, this rate has to be decided by the end of this fiscal year in order for it to be enacted for fiscal year 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1835.254s">And</a> the deadline to apply for that is April 1st of 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1839.358s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1839.538s">I</a> think I saw an okay.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2085.95s">Yes,</a> thank you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2087.748s">So</a> I just want to note and really reiterate that House Bill 440 urges the Massachusetts legislature to take action to pass a measure to enable independent public retirement systems to use their prudent judgment in regards to fossil fuel divestment. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2102.655s">So</a> it's important to note that this body's support of the bill does not codify any action by the city, but it simply expresses our support of a bill that would allow us to divest from fossil fuels at some time in the future, should we choose to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2117.276s">So</a> I bring this forth, Councilor Bears and I bring this forth at the behest of many citizens that have reached out in the city of Medford, and a number of which are actually in the retirement system in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2129.142s">By</a> de facto investing our retirement funds in fossil fuels, we tacitly support emissions that contribute to climate change and all the damage associated with it, including air pollution and any issues and ailments caused by it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2141.049s">And</a> I think it's, we as a city, <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2143.604s">It's</a> very hard for us to work towards climate change adaptation and mitigation in one office while we invest in the very industry that's caused the need for such things in another. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2153.95s">So</a> the current crisis also highlights just how vulnerable and sensitive our systems are. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2158.332s">And</a> we can't continue to invest in a system that damages the very planet we live on and exacerbates all natural crises. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2165.116s">And</a> that's kind of my stump for that.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2366.236s">Councilor</a> Perak. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2369.097s">As</a> I understand Perak, <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2370.812s">In</a> a previous decision brought forth from the Somerville City Council, and I know there are actually people on this call who are very well versed in that, they advised against it, but they actually, at a later date, they went back on that decision, I believe, or just decided that it was actually not the best advisement as far as ways to invest. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2391.065s">So</a> because that independent board had advised against it, <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2396.695s">they</a> were, the Somerville City Council was unable to pass their measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2399.316s">And</a> that's why this has come up in this form, because I see Councilor Scarpelli has his hand raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2407.0s">If</a> people can offer, yeah, I mean, that's my poor retelling of it, so.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2487.958s">Yeah,</a> thank you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2488.778s">So</a> this isn't just like a feel good kind of, so Bill, I mean, it does feel good, but the boards do need specific legislative authority because the way it is designed, and I do know that there are people on the call that can speak to this, <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2504.551s">but</a> it's not just that there is specific authority that is needed.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2578.547s">Point</a> of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2579.447s">Thank</a> you, Councilmember Mox. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2581.389s">Point</a> of information, Councilmember Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2583.411s">So</a> this won't codify any decision by our public, our retirement system. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2588.015s">This</a> will just say we have, it will give <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2591.016s">bodies</a> like the public retirement system in Medford, it will give them the option to make this decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2597.502s">It</a> doesn't divest. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2599.544s">It</a> doesn't do anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2600.385s">It</a> just gives the option to make that decision at a future date, should they choose to.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=4571.179s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=4572.4s">First,</a> I want to start off commending the administration for the sheer amount of information they've been presenting online through reverse 911, social media, <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=4581.293s">It's</a> definitely been helpful in these times when everything is changing so fast. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=4585.914s">But</a> there is still a certain amount of our community that might not be reached by these measures. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=4590.255s">So</a> I think it's definitely whatever we can do to get a mailing out to or a physical piece of mail out to our residents so that they understand not only what's going on in the city, but relevant to recent congressional policy that's been passed as far as how it impacts individuals, <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=4607.986s">those</a> seeking unemployment, as well as small businesses and that whole program. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=4611.888s">So</a> again, I do understand that everything is changing by the minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=4616.011s">I</a> mean, you can see it just in this meeting, the fact that where stuff is being withdrawn because stuff has changed in the few days since we submitted. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=4623.115s">But</a> I do think it's important that we view an opportunity to work with the administration to do a print material to reach people we might not be reaching otherwise.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5888.097s">Yeah,</a> I just want to thank Councilor Bears for bringing this forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5891.158s">I</a> think this is really important right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5892.958s">I</a> think we're kind of building the plane as we're flying it as this crisis necessitates. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5898.42s">So</a> I think setting up teams like this, task force like this to respond to the pressing needs of our community are really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5906.922s">And</a> again, getting that cohesive messaging moving forward too as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5910.123s">So</a> I thank him and I look forward to supporting this.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=10395.316s">Sure,</a> yeah, thank you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=10397.218s">So</a> we met to go over the signed denials that had come in during the moratorium. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=10403.062s">We</a> had Mr. Bravuso and Mr. Moki with us to kind of answer any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=10409.428s">And</a> so we reviewed the three that came in during that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=10412.33s">And</a> then Mr. Bravuso also provided some just ideas for future amendments <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=10417.825s">to</a> the sign ordinance that would help people compliant and really bring it up to date.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=10437.194s">I</a> mean, we didn't, the action was, I think it was to <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=10446.472s">keep</a> the papers in committee and then.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_3EjMDeUU8A8/2024-11-19_3EjMDeUU8A8.html">City Council 03-31-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=2036.512s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=2037.813s">Councilor</a> Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=2039.914s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=2041.015s">I</a> also agree with my colleagues as far as this not being <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=2044.835s">of</a> the road we want to go down or the response. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=2046.617s">But</a> I think something is important with the city board recommendation is that for design standards that the building commissioner could draft up. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=2054.103s">I</a> think, as I understand it, there is a little bit of a gray area with some of this stuff that if the building commissioner could draft some design standards, it would help him to act a little bit more in favor with the attended existing ordinances as far as enforcement and what goes on on lots right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=2073.222s">I</a> don't know if that's something we want to bring up at a later date, but I think it's just something we don't want to lose. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=2076.845s">Again,</a> I agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=2077.866s">It's</a> not something we should go forward with in general, the zoning change in general, but I do think the design standards are something important we should look into. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=2087.552s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=2088.913s">Councilor</a> Marks.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=2356.351s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=2897.658s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=4148.053s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=4149.194s">I</a> see that residents were mailed, abutters were mailed about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=4154.938s">Is</a> that certified mail usually? <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=4156.419s">Is</a> there a way of just confirming receipt of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=4158.701s">I</a> just know sometimes we have issues with notification.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=4882.134s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=4883.074s">So</a> with the asphalt replacement, would that be curb-to-curb repaving in this instance, or would it be like patchwork? <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=4890.21s">you</a> may be opening up in a way that would only necessitate that, but just for clarity.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=5332.386s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=5333.546s">So</a> I've been in touch over the past few months with both the building commissioner and the acting city solicitor to try to get an update on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=5340.752s">And</a> the most recent update I have from the city solicitor is the developer is actually in land court with a complaint against the city for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=5348.577s">And</a> that's been continued to at least May, likely further out because of the COVID-19 public health crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=5356.755s">not</a> really a ton of answers, but I think this may be a reason it's kind of hard to get answers on this right now, is there's ongoing legal proceedings that will really only get probably slowed down at this point, just because of what we're dealing with these days.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=5509.971s">I</a> want to stop you before you go through the whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=5513.332s">We</a> had a number of individuals who wanted to, well, we originally submitted, I originally submitted this for the meeting that got canceled and we had a number of individuals that wanted to <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=5523.539s">Councilor</a> Peruzza. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=5524.099s">I</a> will speak on this but they are unable to make this meeting so motion to table to the next meeting.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6361.327s">Yeah,</a> thank you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6362.628s">I</a> just wanted to further amend the original paper just so that after the line about immediate moratorium on rent, mortgage payments, evictions, and foreclosures, I know Councilor Bears inserted residential commercial properties, and then just insert the phrase <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6380.036s">it</a> makes sense, it's kind of a long sentence now, just those people, to clarify them, so those people impacted directly by the COVID-19 pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6388.819s">So</a> for reasons that it's not just like a blanket, so people impacted by that are those we would be focused on.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=7798.587s">Councilor</a> Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=7800.649s">Yeah,</a> I'm fine with that amendment because the amendment is to sentences that would no longer exist as it is amended by Councilor Baer. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=7807.875s">So</a> that is fine by me.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8416.268s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8417.109s">Yeah,</a> I just want to thank you for suggesting that amendment regarding the PPEs. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8421.472s">In</a> my full-time role, I've actually been transitioned away from a lot of my normal duties to really help triage an effort to coordinate donations of PPEs to facilities in need. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8431.721s">And</a> I'm seeing these emails come through every day of facilities that you would think or you would hope have the level of PPE they need, and they certainly do not. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8439.787s">So</a> I think having a better understanding of our levels in Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8444.492s">And</a> if there is a need for more and, you know, having those numbers so we can explore making sure we're not running out and that we're not asking our first responders and just anyone who needs this kind of personal protective equipment to do without. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8459.848s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=9421.507s">I</a> think you're going to say be a motion to waive the reading of the example framework.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=9487.21s">Um,</a> yeah, I'll withdraw. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=9488.211s">I</a> couldn't find it in the, um, I was looking through the agendas. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=9490.832s">I</a> sort of looked through the minutes with the agendas. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=9492.493s">This</a> was an, uh, I think this was an amendment to actually add the permitting. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=9495.595s">So,</a> uh, I couldn't find it in the agendas. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=9498.257s">So</a> yeah, I can withdraw this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=9500.158s">Okay,</a> no problem.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=9514.286s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=9514.566s">Let's</a> do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=9516.322s">just</a> the reason for, just to speak on it, the reason for this coming up is I'm sure everyone saw, or a lot of people saw the bins in the Aldi's parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=9526.31s">There's</a> just an incredible amount of things dumped in front of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=9529.813s">And</a> I think the mayor, she acted on this very quickly and she was able to get people out to clean it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=9535.098s">But</a> I think, I understand that we are in strange times right now and things aren't moving as fast as they normally would. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=9542.283s">But</a> I think this is actually an issue of public health <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=9544.72s">and</a> we had to divert resources last week, city resources to go clean up this mess that shouldn't be there in the first place. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=9551.205s">So</a> I think this is something that we do need to, whether it's following up the city solicitor and we'll send this along this framework as well to help guide that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=9560.272s">But</a> I think it is something we do need to move on.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=10336.571s">I</a> can add clarity. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=10337.892s">So</a> this just has to be, when I checked with DLS, this just has to be passed by the end of June for it to go into effect for FY21. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=10345.796s">So</a> we do have time to pass it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=10347.057s">We</a> obviously should move on it as soon as possible so we don't forget or lose it or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=10352.04s">But</a> we way missed the deadline to pass this for FY20. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=10356.824s">That</a> would have had to have been done last June. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=10359.025s">So</a> we're looking at FY21 for this.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=10514.245s">I</a> mean, I can't remember what words we're using. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=10518.387s">I</a> can remember what adjectives we found.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_WYTf73F7sag/2024-11-19_WYTf73F7sag.html">City Council 03-10-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1936.943s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1938.204s">I</a> just wanted to clarify. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1939.385s">So</a> these don't have any impact on the budget as far as these changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1942.427s">These</a> are simply entitled only, and they don't remove any other. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1945.109s">They're</a> not replacing any other positions, correct?
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3694.918s">I</a> want to give you the money Thank You console and I console morale Thank You mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3702.023s">I</a> just want to echo my colleagues and thank you both for coming out I know you're both here early. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3705.125s">So</a> thank you for sticking with us and taking the time to present on this It's it's so great to have another space for public art in the city and then combining it with the actual utility of benches Is is beautiful. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3715.372s">So</a> thank you for bringing this forth
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4848.925s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4849.806s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Knight for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4852.107s">And</a> I believe sending to the city solicitor, the acting city solicitor for an opinion on this change is the right thing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4857.63s">And</a> I agree that this is done in an effort to actually increase participation and that people can understand what's going to be on the agenda and what they can come to speak on and make plans to actually come out to the council to speak on those items. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4870.017s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6189.912s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6190.713s">Yeah,</a> I mean, I just want to reiterate. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6191.873s">I</a> think this is really just the changing of how numbers are assigned. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6195.756s">We're</a> not limiting speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6197.057s">And</a> to Councilor Behr's point, the gentleman's point, and just discussions we had about perhaps looking at our rules in general, maybe it is an option to move that public participation to the beginning of the meeting and in the interest of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6208.446s">But</a> it's not limiting speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6210.327s">It's</a> simply just procedural. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6212.048s">So</a> I support it.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6857.723s">Just</a> as I understand, I mean, the big issue with this change is just saying that this is reserved for only matters requiring council action per law. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6865.007s">So</a> I think it's just clarifying the response people can expect. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6869.069s">So</a> if they fall under these categories, they can expect that we can act on it as required by law as opposed to <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6876.212s">issue</a> of another sort that we might not even be, we can deliberate on, but the action we can take is limited to, you know, maybe asking the administration to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6882.958s">It's</a> not under our purview by law. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6884.48s">So</a> I think this is just adding clarification and helping set expectations to the public that already exist, but just being very clear about the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6892.848s">And</a> again, not about limiting speech, but just being clear about procedural things. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6897.151s">And</a> that's why I voted in favor of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6899.654s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8545.954s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8548.135s">Councilor</a> Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8549.585s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8550.927s">I</a> have a number of concerns with this text amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8554.291s">I</a> understand your request to send to the building commissioner, but I see it as being overly broad and really runs the risk of implying that the public asset of street parking is actually owned by individuals who are closest to it, which, of course, is not the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8568.717s">By</a> adding curb cuts, we are further limiting parking, and with this being overly broad, it's unclear. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8574.121s">Does</a> someone several houses down from where this was taken, if they haven't had parking in front of their house for decades, are they allowed to apply for this? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8583.367s">But</a> none of this speaks to the fact that this would have an environmental impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8589.131s">It</a> would increase the amount of impervious surface in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8593.057s">Pervious</a> surface and green infrastructure such as trees and dirt and soil are really important to mitigate the amount of stormwater drain off that goes into the Mystic River. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8602.75s">We</a> already have flooding issues in the city by adding more pavement. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8606.226s">We</a> run the risk of exacerbating them. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8610.389s">I</a> do worry that also because of this, mature and significant trees will be under threat as people seek to make space to lay down asphalt. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8617.433s">I</a> also have concerns that the buffer zones referenced are too vague. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8619.995s">You</a> can look around the city at buffer zones that already exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8622.837s">There's</a> maybe some mulch, maybe one tiny bush. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8625.939s">This</a> definitely looks to <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8628.564s">Kind</a> of impact neighbors who are around that suddenly their neighbors are parking with their headlights on what was formerly a front yard. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8636.488s">They</a> have headlights in their window. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8637.808s">And</a> then also, often we talk about beautification in this chamber and beautification of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8642.811s">And</a> while I know beauty is in the eye of the beholder, I feel that parking on your front lawn, adding asphalt to formerly green, <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8650.558s">And</a> green infrastructure hardly goes far in the way of beautification of this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8654.823s">So</a> as I said, I have a number of concerns on this proposed text amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8659.389s">So</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8660.791s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8661.091s">Council</a> morale.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_uIlyuj9UctU/2024-11-19_uIlyuj9UctU.html">City Council 02-25-20</a></h2>

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=1758.267s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=1758.987s">I</a> want to thank you both so much for coming out tonight and putting all the work into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=1762.671s">My</a> life outside this council is I work in sustainability. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=1765.627s">And</a> I had a bunch of points I was going to make, but you guys hit them all in the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=1769.928s">So</a> I thank you for doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=1771.728s">In</a> the world of sustainability, it's easy to get overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of the task at hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=1778.53s">And</a> I think that's why it's so important what you did, things where we can make change, places where we can start. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=1785.111s">And</a> then hopefully we can go farther from here even as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=1787.871s">And</a> I'm glad that there is the school, the research going on to see what we can do for a feasible replacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=1793.613s">There's</a> a lot of things to think of when it comes in. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=1796.232s">To</a> that and I'm so glad that's already moving forward and as you pointed out there We are surrounded by areas that already have bands like this in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=1802.88s">So</a> I think for local businesses and stuff like that that would be affected by that the ordinance of course builds in time to find alternatives and then there are these communities around us where businesses are making this work and they can reach out so <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=1816.076s">I</a> thank you so much for taking the initiative to collect those signatures, bring this before the council, and just do such a thorough presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=1824.081s">And</a> I'm so happy to support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=1826.243s">So</a> thank you.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2289.344s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2290.004s">I'm</a> just curious if there might be loud music or any sound to be expected during this time.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2513.565s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2514.906s">So</a> recently had a local business owner reach out and say that they had reached out to the city about a storefront improvement program, and they were told that we no longer run the program or we no longer issue funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2525.973s">So</a> these are local programs that provide financial support to businesses looking to improve or update their public facing. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2531.777s">Facades</a> I did reach out to Ashley Williams the CDBG administrator for the city to see if we could find out more She said in her time with the city three and a half years The program hasn't been run and it was kind of hard-pressed to find the last time this program has been run I actually did find reference to it in a job posting from 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2550.371s">So</a> it seems there was previous interest in this but several our neighboring communities run these type of programs where they either offer a 0% deferred payment loan or a <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2559.517s">or</a> matching grant funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2560.938s">And</a> a lot of times these funds are small. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2563.299s">In</a> many communities, they're capped around $2,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2565.68s">And</a> I think with many of our local businesses operating on razor-thin margins, this program with small amounts of funds would actually make all the difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2574.825s">So</a> these programs are funded a number of different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2577.287s">So</a> depending if it is a spot basis for a business where decay or blight can be identified, CDBG would possibly fund that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2585.901s">Same</a> thing with businesses being in a certain census track, which we might not qualify for. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2590.623s">But</a> I think there's also the option where, with the business district parking funds that, as we were updated, I believe, have been found, for lack of a better word. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2599.646s">Perhaps</a> this is a way where we can directly fund businesses or support businesses to increase that curb appeal and beautification that we talk about so often in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2610.99s">In</a> this chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2612.352s">So</a> really all I'm asking for is the city to provide an update on the sass of the program because that's Some hard to find and just to understand the level of interest so that as businesses do look for this program because this program does exist in Cambridge and blue burn and Worcester and still win in a number of surrounding communities as businesses come into Medford or they've been here for a long time and they're looking for this kind of support. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2632.348s">We're</a> able to give them an answer, point them in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2635.631s">And</a> also to that end, there is the public meeting on March 11th for the CDBG five-year consolidated plan and one-year annual action plan where they are seeking public input. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2644.397s">So</a> I think having this update from the city from the status or interest in a program like this would be timely, understanding that public meeting is coming up on the 11th.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3940.039s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3942.7s">I</a> support exploring this a little bit further. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3944.261s">I</a> was remiss during that meeting and understanding the handicapped spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3949.424s">I'm</a> sure there are no handicapped spaces that would be removed as part of this that are proposed to be removed, but just understanding that those spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3956.898s">and</a> the accessible spaces do remain for the people that need them. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3960.282s">To</a> the point of this debate over the bike lane to nowhere, I think people are missing the point that this is a safe route to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3965.869s">So</a> that lane is right around the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3967.571s">The</a> idea is that children will be in that safe, protected bike lane and get to the school safely. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3973.038s">Adults</a> can then merge into traffic bike riders can then merge into traffic as they are used to in many points through many cities I understand the residents who are concerned about having to cross the street if they have to park across the street The point of this project is to make that street safer so that people can cross so that people as they drive through that corridor <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3991.697s">they</a> see bikes, they see pedestrians, they see cars, they understand this isn't an area that I just fly through. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3996.861s">This</a> is an area that has the flashing crossing right now, that has a crossing guard, and you can go to that area in the mornings and watch the crossing guard almost get hit by cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4007.209s">So</a> I think we are running the risk of losing this money by not being able to see the forest through the trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4017.061s">And</a> people talk about not having money to do things in Medford and we have a million dollars to make these streets safer, to make the streets safer in front of our school, to support children getting to school, to support alternative transportation to school, to remove some of the cars from the area because people are walking, because people are biking. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4034.088s">And</a> we're looking for ways to lose this money. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4037.01s">So</a> I do support exploring it further, seeing if there are options where we can come to a compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4042.572s">But</a> I think we are not seeing the bigger picture here. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4046.555s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4047.155s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Morell.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4116.39s">I</a> did clarify with the city engineer that this funding is based on the multimodal. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4122.076s">So</a> it's walking and biking. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4123.658s">So</a> the compromise has to include biking in some way.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4746.126s">As</a> I understand, we do have a bike network plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4749.767s">I</a> don't know how old it is, but I have seen it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4751.967s">There</a> is a bike network plan that exists.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4888.958s">Yeah,</a> I could go. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4891.179s">I</a> don't want to make this a debate about bikes, which it seems it has turned into, but just a <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4895.75s">Many</a> people who cycle and ride their bike to work are also own cars, drive cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4901.374s">When</a> they're biking, they're not in their car. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4903.196s">They're</a> not damaging the roads the same way a car does. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4905.637s">They're</a> not adding to congestion the same way a car does. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4908.72s">Bikes</a> aren't perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4909.6s">None</a> of this is perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4910.561s">We're</a> retrofitting old infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4912.883s">But</a> it's a bigger issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4917.767s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_kv8LdhmTAaQ/2024-11-19_kv8LdhmTAaQ.html">City Council 02-11-20</a></h2>

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=102.295s">Present.</a> 
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1576.343s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1577.424s">So</a> I do apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1578.385s">So</a> the current minimum for Medford is actually $40,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1580.407s">In</a> a last session, this body <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1585.379s">Adjusted</a> the interest rate and also at some point that cap was adjusted I found some pages on the website that need to be updated with the current cap But even at that level of $40,000 for the income cap Medford still lags behind surrounding cities in this state program So for people that don't know this is a state program that Medford takes part in that allows residents who meet certain criteria And are over the age of 65 to defer their property taxes until their house is sold or they pass away <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1616.283s">Medford</a> like every other municipality has to set an income cap on this and an interest rate as I said The interest rate was lower to 5% last session and I think the members of this body who helped to pass that But in regards to the income cap at $40,000 For context Somerville's limit is 57,000 Cambridge is 53,000 and it should be noted that both of these communities have owner occupied exemptions, which we do not have in Medford, so I <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1642.702s">As</a> far as kind of tools in our tools box to help people who need it to get relief from their property taxes were really limited. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1650.484s">So</a> I think it's important that we make sure we're at the highest level allowed by the state so that as many people who do wish to take part in this program can. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1659.486s">I</a> think I check with the chief assessor the city assessor. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1663.267s">Believe</a> only two households currently take part in the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1665.448s">So</a> I understand it's not for everyone with the interest rates and the way the interest rate actually Changes at the time of the owner passing away or being sold But the state does allow us to raise this cap to the senior circuit breaker tax credit And I do understand that other communities rather than having to come back to this income cap time and again They're wording it such that this program is <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1690.851s">in</a> their city is for people who meet the requirements with income not exceeding the state cap calculated under Clause 41A of Section 5 of Chapter 59. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1699.625s">So</a> that's something that as the state adjusts, Medford would adjust along with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1704.348s">So</a> I'm raising this now and my motion is to send this to Committee of the Whole in either February or March so it's something that we can have the city assessor come out and explain to us how this program, if more people were to take part in this at this higher income cap or other potential caps, how it would just affect cash flow so that we can look at that during budget time as we have these, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1729.693s">Meetings</a> hopefully earlier, as we discussed already in this meeting, and I'd also like to add a beat paper so that when that rate is set, this does go up as a notice in the next property tax bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1742.483s">The</a> deadline to apply for this program is April 1st, so it would be hard for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1748.027s">We</a> can't do it this time around, but knowing when this rate is set. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1750.905s">just</a> so people are aware of this program because it is a program from the state that people around the state take part in. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1757.11s">And</a> I want to make sure that Medford residents do know about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1761.133s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1769.679s">Um,</a> so when this, when we set or <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1772.915s">Whether</a> we stay with the current cap, if we pick a new cap, whatever it is, after we have this committee of the whole, that we include a notice of this program the next time property tax bills are sent out.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2498.906s">I</a> heard, the number I got from the assessor this week was two households.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4804.732s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4806.132s">So,</a> yeah, we introduced this because I know I feel already a lot of questions from residents about what voice residents and the city has in this process process. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4815.977s">And</a> we're in a somewhat unprecedented place with three applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4820.689s">At</a> this time for 40 B projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4822.33s">So</a> I did speak with the mayor about this, and she informed me that she'll be engaging an expert to speak with department heads in City Hall on 40 be within the next couple of weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4831.596s">And</a> that is something that Councilors will be invited to, um, hopefully something we can report back out on. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4837.447s">And</a> then I guess that mass housing will also provide a consultant so that something else she may be pursuing So just options to look at so just the idea that when this is in place after we've had these meetings these briefings Having a public meeting or committee the whole set to this so that we can have someone a department had someone from the building department who is up to speed on where we stand with all these applications and what <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4862.677s">power</a> we have can present this out and provide a bit of a forum for people to ask questions about what this will look like going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4870.801s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Morell.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6232.588s">Those</a> records? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6233.549s">I</a> found them to be excellent.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_7sfoGg_NhzM/2024-11-19_7sfoGg_NhzM.html">City Council 01-21-20</a></h2>

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2336.056s">Councilor</a> Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2337.398s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2338.659s">I</a> also want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this up and doing so much research and also thank the residents for all the research they have done. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2345.117s">The</a> emails I've received, this is really kind of a deep issue, complicated by the fact that the FCC, beyond the 1996 Telecommunications Act, came down last year and basically removed a lot of the power that local governments have to regulate this kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2364.006s">So</a> the challenge of the one benefit is that almost every city around the country is dealing with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2370.049s">So</a> there is a lot to learn from, as Councilor Mark said, people who are successfully developing ordinances to make sure the needs of their communities are being met. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2379.193s">So</a> I support those resolutions and I thank Councilor Marks for going even farther than suggesting ordinance work and seeing what we can get from the state delegation because <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2389.978s">This</a> isn't just affecting Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2391.299s">This</a> is affecting the whole state, and we deserve the support at the state level and beyond. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2396.443s">So</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=2398.985s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Morell.

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=7080.572s">That's</a> a morale. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=7081.713s">Thank</a> you Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=7082.493s">I</a> want to thank Councilors Falco a night for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=7085.175s">This</a> is something I raised at our legislative meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=7088.338s">The</a> commission that I get the most questions about is is the traffic commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=7091.32s">That's</a> the one at least the one that meets at a time that's really hard to me for people to get to. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=7096.584s">So</a> I think it's important that we make these meetings accessible and it goes a long way. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=7102.429s">I</a> think in goodwill and people understanding how to move things forward, how to get issues addressed that they face all the time moving throughout the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=7109.722s">So</a> I fully support this resolution.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_eQfu2R5n4yE/2024-11-19_eQfu2R5n4yE.html">City Council 01-14-20</a></h2>

 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4674.544s">Councilor</a> Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4676.085s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4677.006s">Um,</a> I'd like to echo a few of the points made by Councilor Marks, you know, really just that lead time because of the weekend, having that extra time to understand the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4684.912s">A</a> lot of times the agendas are written in a way that if you don't come to council meetings regularly, it can seem like a different language. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4690.656s">So</a> taking the time to really understand and absorb what's actually going to come before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4695.54s">Um,</a> and I think Councilor Marks for bringing up childcare and the coordination that needs to go into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4699.903s">A</a> lot of times women are the primary caregivers, and when you limit the planning time for child care, you look who can actually come out and speak on an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4708.892s">Something</a> that actually hasn't been mentioned is Tuesday nights, all the city hall staff is already home, so you have those parking spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4716.058s">Wednesday</a> nights, if you move the meetings, then the parking lot is full, you have a contentious issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4720.499s">People</a> who maybe are waffling about coming to a meeting, they see the lot's full, they leave, they don't come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4725.14s">So</a> that's something we have to consider. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4727.581s">And</a> then going back to the point of resolutions under suspension, that happens under the purview of this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4733.302s">So</a> even beyond setting a rule, it's up to the discretion of each and every Councilor here. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4737.763s">So</a> having that discretion, deciding, you know, there is stuff that's gonna be timely that you want to bring up that very night. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4743.825s">but</a> a lot of times it can wait to be put on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4746.426s">So</a> I think that's just things to think about and why Tuesday might, you know, may work better historically and now and going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4755.191s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4756.371s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5727.841s">Councilor</a> Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5729.382s">I</a> had the distinct pleasure of working with Solicitor Rumley as we were trying to explore potential women's commission by ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5735.947s">And</a> I was always so impressed with his ability to really hear what people were asking for and come back with stuff that is just absolutely perfect and by the letter of the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5744.713s">And</a> in lieu of really a formal training for new councilors, <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5748.516s">Solicitor</a> Romley was very kind to incoming councillor bears and myself as far as Giving us kind of just a lay of the land and sharing as much information as he could to make us Make this job a little bit easier for us and help us be the best at this job So I thank him for his many years of service to the city And I'm just sad that I will not get to work with him in an official capacity Thank You councillor Morell consulate beers
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=6163.534s">I</a> just wanted to echo Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=6166.576s">Representation</a> is so important in politics, and I think, you know, just showing that politics is for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=6171.519s">Everyone</a> deserves a voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=6173.1s">And</a> also, I believe the new mayor is perhaps the fifth woman mayor in the city, so also count it as one more crack in that glass ceiling. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=6180.205s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nicole Morell]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=6736.407s">Sure,</a> yeah, I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=6737.067s">I</a> just, I mean, I don't have any more information than anyone else. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=6739.828s">I</a> live close to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=6741.349s">Okay,</a> I live close to this ongoing, whatever it is at this point, this ongoing hole, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=6747.692s">And</a> yeah, we could talk circles around this because there's a number of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=6750.853s">I</a> believe there's no sidewalk on the other side. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=6752.634s">That's</a> the portion where there's no sidewalk on Rent the, <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=6755.455s">It's</a> a mess, and I don't have the answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=6758.016s">I</a> don't even know what's going on, so I agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=6760.136s">I</a> would just love to be able, for myself, I live near there, but also, as people ask, to be able to give them an answer.
