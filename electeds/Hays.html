    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=332.329s">[Hays]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10481.801s">[Hays]</a>: Sharon Hayes, 69 Ripley Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10484.182s">[Hays]</a>: I had a question about one specific thing that was mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10489.264s">[Hays]</a>: The replacement for the response to intervention, that was really a huge rollout, I remember.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10495.707s">[Hays]</a>: At least, was it last year or the year before?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10497.888s">[Hays]</a>: And I know I was specifically very interested in it because as an educator myself, I've been involved in response and intervention<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10505.379s">[Hays]</a>: in other cities and towns and it's a really good process for identifying students who need extra support and then making sure you follow up in a set amount of time to see if they need to go further, if they need more support, if they need to be tested for special education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10520.206s">[Hays]</a>: So I'm a little concerned to hear that that's being dropped or being morphed into something else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10526.175s">[Hays]</a>: Well, I guess I'm wondering, is there going to be a description of what that is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10530.157s">[Hays]</a>: Because I've never heard of this new one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10532.098s">[Hays]</a>: I don't know if it's specific to Medford or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10534.539s">[Hays]</a>: But like I said, I know the response to intervention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10536.54s">[Hays]</a>: I know it works well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10537.621s">[Hays]</a>: So personally, I'm a little concerned to hear it's being changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10540.922s">[Hays]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10660.375s">[Hays]</a>: Sharon, you can come on up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10663.076s">[Hays]</a>: And this is probably more, maybe it's going to be discussed at another meeting in more depth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10667.439s">[Hays]</a>: I just know that there were a lot of questions and issues with how to even implement the RTI piece of it, in terms of having staffing to do all of the pieces of it, in terms of going into the classrooms, doing observations, and then providing whatever supports were needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10684.321s">[Hays]</a>: Again, I'm just curious now that it's going to be even a broader process or include more types of interventions or more types of needs, how that's going to be implemented, given that my understanding was RTI has not even been completely implemented yet, the academic piece of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10702.014s">[Hays]</a>: So that's...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10704.505s">[Hays]</a>: Kind of what I'm wondering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10705.225s">[Hays]</a>: I don't know if there's going to be another meeting to talk about it in more depth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10950.424s">[Hays]</a>: We did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2632.864s">[Hays]</a>: Miss, um, member Hays.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2634.866s">[Hays]</a>: Hi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2635.587s">[Hays]</a>: Um, I have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2637.209s">[Hays]</a>: If you could go back, I don't know if you can go back to the chart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2648.073s">[Hays]</a>: So on the week of 2-7 where it says PCR pool testing and contact tracing for high need students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2653.975s">[Hays]</a>: Is the PCR testing only for high need students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2696.135s">[Hays]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2696.435s">[Hays]</a>: Can I have a couple other questions unless someone else<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2709.564s">[Hays]</a>: I wanted to ask about the infographic that went out, which I thought it was great that it went out so quickly that that information just in a really clear simplified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2719.574s">[Hays]</a>: That was wonderful and helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2722.317s">[Hays]</a>: I did want to ask about one possible clarification on that, if there's possibility of tweaking it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2730.526s">[Hays]</a>: I didn't think it was particularly clear when day one since the since really day zero is supposed to be the day when you first find you have symptoms or test positive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2740.973s">[Hays]</a>: And then from there you start counting one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2850.018s">[Hays]</a>: With that in mind, I wanted to ask again about the communication going home in the backpack that we've talked about a few times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2856.548s">[Hays]</a>: if we can get again because there's so many changes that are happening that to get that home because not everyone always accesses the information that comes either through email or on the school website and we talked about that and I was hoping that maybe that's going to happen soon especially because then we can get make sure it all gets out translated and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=2876.73s">[Hays]</a>: everyone gets it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=7408.023s">[Hays]</a>: Going back to the original reason we were looking to start the budget process earlier, looking to be able to hire or have a wider pool of candidates to hire from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=7418.546s">[Hays]</a>: As a teacher, I know when I would look for jobs, I would start looking probably even in early March.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=7423.567s">[Hays]</a>: And there were lots of towns that were listing 2030 anticipated openings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=7429.888s">[Hays]</a>: Is there any reason we couldn't do that, that we at least start<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=7433.616s">[Hays]</a>: getting a pool of candidates we know are interested?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=7482.426s">[Hays]</a>: Maybe I'm unaware, has that been done before?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=7484.188s">[Hays]</a>: Have I just not been aware of it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=7487.891s">[Hays]</a>: Oh, it wasn't, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11681.395s">[Hays]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11682.797s">[Hays]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11683.919s">[Hays]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11684.932s">[Hays]</a>: You know, as the resolution states, we know from many of the experts in the field of pediatric mental health and pediatric psychiatry that there is a significant mental health crisis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11697.844s">[Hays]</a>: And we've talked about this at meetings before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11700.346s">[Hays]</a>: And so this was really an effort as we move into the budget season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11704.791s">[Hays]</a>: to make sure that we're kind of all starting on the same page as to what the supports are that we already have at Bedford public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11712.442s">[Hays]</a>: Some of the titles I think are, you know, we started to talk about it at one meeting I think prior to before I joined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11719.08s">[Hays]</a>: and understanding what the titles are and where the direct services to students come from, and how they're accessing those services, how many of them are accessing them, just so that we can begin to have, or have a more in-depth conversation about what our needs are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11735.631s">[Hays]</a>: So that was the purpose of this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11776.61s">[Hays]</a>: Yeah, so the reason behind that was I know that as a former special ed teacher myself, I know that students who have it on their service grid are going to get it no matter what.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DnBk5C8-dFs&t=11789.341s">[Hays]</a>: So this question was, do we have enough really supports to cover students who don't necessarily have that legal obligation of having it on their IEP grid?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=685.915s">[Hays]</a>: Excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=687.857s">[Hays]</a>: Just to make sure that people understand, because there's a lot of terminology, diagnostic testing, can we go over exactly what will be in place after the pool testing is done this week so people fully understand the different<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=800.706s">[Hays]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=803.348s">[Hays]</a>: I know I've had several questions from people in the community about for families that may have someone living with them who is high risk for any number of reasons, immunocompromised or older or too young to have the vaccine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=817.396s">[Hays]</a>: And I think I already asked this personally of Avery Hines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=821.899s">[Hays]</a>: I just want to make sure that everyone gets to hear it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=824.061s">[Hays]</a>: Is there a way or how can families<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=828.339s">[Hays]</a>: Since we're not doing contact tracing if they need to know if they if they really have a reason to need to know if there's someone in the classes test positive because they they want to have that information in terms of the person at home that's at risk, how can they or can they is there a way for them to go about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=846.76s">[Hays]</a>: talking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=847.22s">[Hays]</a>: I think what nurse Hines had said was to have them talk to the school nurse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=849.982s">[Hays]</a>: I just wanted to make sure that kind of got out in a public forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3723.746s">[Hays]</a>: Member Hays.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3725.706s">[Hays]</a>: I just wanted to clarify, because I thought your question had more to do with, if there's more than 16 kids identified that need the support,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=3733.887s">[Hays]</a>: will you only go with the lowest, you know, 16, or is there an opportunity to expand to two groups at a grade level?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=7580.798s">[Hays]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=7582.318s">[Hays]</a>: A couple of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=7583.308s">[Hays]</a>: hopefully quick questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=7585.77s">[Hays]</a>: One is, I feel like I remember this being discussed at a meeting, but I think it predated me, talk about a sliding scale to increase the revenue from those who maybe could afford a little bit more while still keeping it affordable for others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=7602.424s">[Hays]</a>: I feel like that's been discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=7604.366s">[Hays]</a>: Maybe there was a reason why it was dismissed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=7606.247s">[Hays]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=7607.068s">[Hays]</a>: And then I'll ask my other question into the boat,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=7610.515s">[Hays]</a>: Given that we were just talking about how limited it is really difficult to find after school care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=7615.8s">[Hays]</a>: Before school, I'm sure I know from experience after school care is very difficult to find, and given that especially it's hard to find anything affordable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=7624.306s">[Hays]</a>: Can we talk about or has there been talk about making sure that there are seats, some seats available?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=7632.953s">[Hays]</a>: I don't know at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=7634.074s">[Hays]</a>: I think you spoke earlier, but I'm not sure we talked about numbers of how many actual<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=7639.747s">[Hays]</a>: students that are from low income or economically disadvantaged families, and how are we making sure that not only it's affordable for them, but there are seats available for them, because it's going to be that much harder for them to find accessible, affordable child care than for some of the members of the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=7797.067s">[Hays]</a>: Is there some way we can get more detailed information about what you're looking at?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=7802.03s">[Hays]</a>: I don't know if that's even appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0SdCkR9KuqQ&t=7863.67s">[Hays]</a>: has there been consideration from the other end, looking at the data of how many people could afford more so that maybe this modest, very modest increase could be more of an increase to people who could afford more?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=656.864s">[Hays]</a>: Hi, thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=658.685s">[Hays]</a>: I just wanted to say, too, given this is my first time going through the evaluation,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=665.393s">[Hays]</a>: It was difficult, I have to say, because there are, even though I understand from Member Ruseau that it's been actually streamlined by DESE, there still were 20 indicators that we needed to give an evaluation on or give some kind of feedback on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=682.44s">[Hays]</a>: And looking back at some of the information from DESE, I think as we move forward, I know Member Graham has kind of started us on the path<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=692.259s">[Hays]</a>: updating this process to more closely match what DESE has.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=698.205s">[Hays]</a>: According to DESE, we should be choosing like six to eight of focus indicators that we would really be doing our evaluation on, which I think makes a lot more sense in terms of helping us as a school committee and also helping<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=712.072s">[Hays]</a>: the superintendent kind of focus on what our main goals are, even though, of course, she's always and we're always looking at the whole picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=721.42s">[Hays]</a>: You know, I think, I think as as member McLaughlin said, I think that when the new superintendent came in, I think there was hope for or expectation and possibly unrealistic, definitely unrealistic expectation of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=737.464s">[Hays]</a>: instant change and we're excited, we're going to make all these changes and kind of update a lot of policies, update a lot of curriculum, just everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=745.728s">[Hays]</a>: And not only I think was it probably the timeline that people were hoping for, unrealistic anyway, but then you throw in the pandemic and you know, the focus shifted and it had to shift and we're really still coming out of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=764.397s">[Hays]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=766.182s">[Hays]</a>: I wanted to make that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=767.183s">[Hays]</a>: And also just to make the point that I think anytime you do an evaluation of anyone, unfortunately, I think often you go towards the, I don't want to say negative, but you go to where there could be improvement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=784.756s">[Hays]</a>: And it's also, you know, there's a lot of, I went through and made a list for myself of just all the things that have happened just this year, all the things that Superintendent has done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=793.303s">[Hays]</a>: And there's a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=795.514s">[Hays]</a>: a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=795.974s">[Hays]</a>: And so I want to make sure that at least I want to make clear from my point of view, when I talk about areas where I see improvement, that we can make improvement or make growth, I don't see that as deficiencies so much as we're always going to have areas of growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=812.563s">[Hays]</a>: I mean, hopefully we're always striving for more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=815.884s">[Hays]</a>: So I, you know, when we start talking about where we see areas that we could improve, it's, you know, a district improvement, it's certainly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=824.144s">[Hays]</a>: Also because the superintendent represents the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=827.145s">[Hays]</a>: It's improvements that we see are asking her to implement, but I just wanna, again, like I said, that idea of areas of growth and improvement versus deficiencies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=839.029s">[Hays]</a>: So that's where my head is at in terms of the evaluation and the comments I made, and just wanted to say that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=846.411s">[Hays]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5239.218s">[Hays]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5239.998s">[Hays]</a>: Member Hays.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5243.46s">[Hays]</a>: Thanks, I just I wanted to add to that in terms of I think that's, that's part of what we can improve on with the evaluation process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5249.903s">[Hays]</a>: Also, I looked at some other cities and towns just to see how it's done in other places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5254.766s">[Hays]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5255.27s">[Hays]</a>: And I think they also said this in my orientation, that part of the process when we create the goals is to really talk about what evidence we would need to see to be able to evaluate you clearly and accurately and fully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5268.118s">[Hays]</a>: So I think that as we move forward and start to really try to update this process and make it mirror more, I think what Desi intends, that's a piece that we really should be doing is really being clear about what evidence we want to see so that you know what to expect from us because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5283.437s">[Hays]</a>: You know, if it's open-ended and you don't know, you may feel like you're providing us what we need and we're looking at it and going, but I don't know if that quite meets what I was thinking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5292.302s">[Hays]</a>: So I think if we can all be on the same page about what evidence would give us, you know, would help us to be able to evaluate you, I think that it will go a long way to making this process easier also and fairer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4thVVEd7zdo&t=5303.95s">[Hays]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=815.427s">[Hays]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=815.828s">[Hays]</a>: Yeah, no, I just wanted to say the same as some of my other school committee members have said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=821.718s">[Hays]</a>: I likewise don't feel like I made any errors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=823.9s">[Hays]</a>: There's nothing I want to change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=825.421s">[Hays]</a>: I do hope and plan to meet with the superintendent over the summer just to go over some of my comments and some areas that I didn't get to make any comments because of other things going on in my life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=835.108s">[Hays]</a>: But I think that the major thing that I'm finding from this being my first time and just the general kind of confusion that I'm hearing is that we really do need to meet to talk about the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=848.318s">[Hays]</a>: I think, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=850.174s">[Hays]</a>: it would be great if we had someone from outside to come in and talk with us about the process because it seems like we ourselves are not clear on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=856.999s">[Hays]</a>: So I don't know that just an internal discussion is going to yield satisfying results for everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=863.644s">[Hays]</a>: So, you know, it's, I think it's, I think it's good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=866.145s">[Hays]</a>: I'm just gonna say, I think it's good that we're all taking this so seriously that we are having some major discussions and finding it confusing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=873.25s">[Hays]</a>: I think that means that we're all taking it very seriously and trying to figure out the best way<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=877.298s">[Hays]</a>: to make this work both for the school system, but also for the superintendent, because she's ultimately the one who's being evaluated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=883.662s">[Hays]</a>: And if we're lacking clarity in it, then it's, you know, it's a tough, tough to be the one who's being evaluated if the people doing the evaluation are expressing confusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KhjXcIYz6EA&t=893.729s">[Hays]</a>: So I'm all set with my evaluation though, personally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2888.175s">[Hays]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2889.003s">[Hays]</a>: Member Hays.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2889.723s">[Hays]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2890.103s">[Hays]</a>: Yeah, I also had something for the good of the order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2891.924s">[Hays]</a>: I wanted to, as we've talked a lot about trying to get more student engagement and student involvement, I wanted to discuss the possibility or at least bring up the possibility of having an agenda item that's actually dedicated to the student representatives, so that if they had something they wanted to talk about, if there was an issue, a question, a concern,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2913.555s">[Hays]</a>: or if they wanted to highlight the student achievement, anything, just to put it on the agenda so it's not as if they have to approach us to ask if they can talk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2922.302s">[Hays]</a>: Just a thought, just a way to try to give them more space and support their voice in our meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3056.157s">[Hays]</a>: Probably the school side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8451.221s">[Hays]</a>: Member Hays.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8452.842s">[Hays]</a>: I guess I'd want to add to that, I think another piece that you mentioned, and I don't think you deliberately mentioned it quickly, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8458.871s">[Hays]</a>: the having instructional support coaches as much as the professional development is important, that ongoing support to teachers where they can troubleshoot when they're trying it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8471.261s">[Hays]</a>: You know, you can't do that in a one day professional or even a five day professional development because things happen as you're teaching something and you need to understand how to tweak it or change it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8481.289s">[Hays]</a>: So I think balancing out, if we're talking about how we're going to spend money, you know, instructional support coaches versus<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8489.133s">[Hays]</a>: professional development or do we have the money for it all?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8491.775s">[Hays]</a>: But I just don't want to, I don't want to go over that lightly because you did mention that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8496.138s">[Hays]</a>: And I think that that is incredibly important and something not to be overlooked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8500.38s">[Hays]</a>: I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=683.884s">[Hays]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=684.884s">[Hays]</a>: Member Hays.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=687.41s">[Hays]</a>: Yeah, I had a couple of things, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=689.432s">[Hays]</a>: Thinking about the budget process, as member Graham was saying, I think another thing that would be great for us to do within that earlier budget process is how can we bring the community in more on helping us develop the budget and hopefully also as an educational process for the community to understand how we make the budget and, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=710.447s">[Hays]</a>: decisions that have to be made, I think that's important for the community to be a part of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=716.188s">[Hays]</a>: And then as a, that is a part of maybe a larger goal is our role in educating the community about some of these processes and what we do, what it means to set policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=727.511s">[Hays]</a>: I'm trying to think of some other ones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=730.552s">[Hays]</a>: We've talked about these kind of along the way among ourselves, maybe, maybe at meetings, we've talked about how there are certain things where we could hold maybe<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=740.08s">[Hays]</a>: town hall meetings that we could educate the public, or maybe we create videos that could go on our school committee webpage that people could refer back to any time when they want to understand some of the things that we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=753.663s">[Hays]</a>: So again, that kind of view of us as a body that also communicates with and educates the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1231.285s">[Hays]</a>: Member Hays?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1232.766s">[Hays]</a>: I guess it would depend on what we're considering to be that goal timeline or the term, because how many we choose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1241.233s">[Hays]</a>: If we're only going to the end of this year, then we want to choose accordingly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1246.037s">[Hays]</a>: But if we're going to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1247.025s">[Hays]</a>: start now and go until next January, we might want to choose more goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1643.135s">[Hays]</a>: I just wanted to, you know, member Ruseau had<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1647.258s">[Hays]</a>: asked if I had any thoughts about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1649.259s">[Hays]</a>: I do think it would be a lot for a new member to step in and try to help set goals for something they've never been a part of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1656.064s">[Hays]</a>: So as for that piece of information, I mean, I do think that would be hard and depending on how many new members we have, that could make it a really difficult process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1664.65s">[Hays]</a>: The other thing I'm wondering is, you know, when I looked through all these documents, it seemed the idea of all the goal setting is from the top down, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1673.676s">[Hays]</a>: That our goals should<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1676.853s">[Hays]</a>: the superintendent's goals coincide with the goals all the way down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/BSAjmRA8UYk&t=1680.975s">[Hays]</a>: So if everyone else is working on basically a september to june, maybe it doesn't make a difference, but I just wanted to throw that out there that if we're working on a different timeline, but all of our goals are supposed to work together, you know, does that make a difference?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=0.651s">[Hays]</a>: Today, May 22, 2023, from 5 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=3.492s">[Hays]</a>: to 6 p.m., there will be an evaluation subcommittee meeting to be held through remote participation via Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=10.254s">[Hays]</a>: The meeting can be viewed through Medford Community Media on Comcast Channel 15 and Verizon Channel 45 at 5 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=73.453s">[Hays]</a>: As approved by the committee on February 1 2023 the evaluation subcommittee will meet to review and develop the process for the 2022 23 superintendent evaluation, and in particular tonight's agenda is as approved by the evaluation subcommittee on Thursday, February 16 2023 the subcommittee will meet to create the composite evaluation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=95.719s">[Hays]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=104.487s">[Hays]</a>: I just literally a couple of minutes ago sent the other subcommittee members, shared with them the folder I've created with all of the member evaluations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=122.079s">[Hays]</a>: Oh, I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=123.42s">[Hays]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=123.76s">[Hays]</a>: That's OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=125.141s">[Hays]</a>: Thank you for reminding me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=127.702s">[Hays]</a>: I will call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=128.523s">[Hays]</a>: Member Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=154.153s">[Hays]</a>: And member Hays is present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=157.235s">[Hays]</a>: All members are present so we can begin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=159.016s">[Hays]</a>: So I just like I said, I was beginning to say I shared<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=166.023s">[Hays]</a>: moments before the meeting started or probably maybe even a moment as it started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=171.945s">[Hays]</a>: So I began creating the composite just in terms of putting the ratings, which I will share with you guys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=184.208s">[Hays]</a>: I have not had a chance to compile all of the comments because I don't think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=191.386s">[Hays]</a>: I gave myself enough time, I think we probably should have planned a couple of days between the due date and the meeting, because all of the, all of them came in, except membercrats, all of them came in yesterday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=202.75s">[Hays]</a>: So let me see if I can bring up the, nope, that's not the right, hold on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=272.126s">[Hays]</a>: It's in the shared folder if you're able to open the Google Drive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=277.029s">[Hays]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=278.19s">[Hays]</a>: It should have been shared with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=279.811s">[Hays]</a>: Hold on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=304.48s">[Hays]</a>: There should be one that's labeled composite, or there is one that's labeled composite.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=366.384s">[Hays]</a>: I'm getting help right now with that one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=385.07s">[Hays]</a>: OK, so what I was able to do so far is compile the ratings and fill them in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=396.439s">[Hays]</a>: We created a composite form where we could put, instead of the checkboxes, we could put in the numbers of each rating so we could see how they kind of fell out in terms of understanding what the final composite rating<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=414.909s">[Hays]</a>: rating scores, for lack of a better word, would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=419.091s">[Hays]</a>: So as we can see, this first page, the goals, the professional practice goals, there was one significant, five said met and one said exceeded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=434.219s">[Hays]</a>: Student learning was one, some progress, one significant, four met, one exceeded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=441.363s">[Hays]</a>: District improvement goals,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=444.383s">[Hays]</a>: three significant progress, three met, and one exceeded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=448.984s">[Hays]</a>: So anyone can jump in at some point if they want to add anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=455.026s">[Hays]</a>: I mean, I think we can see they pretty much fall out in terms of what the combined scores would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=462.929s">[Hays]</a>: They're pretty much all in that met when you look at the preponderance of scores.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=467.951s">[Hays]</a>: Of course, the five is certainly the professional practice goal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=473.235s">[Hays]</a>: the student learning goal, the four and the 18.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=522.505s">[Hays]</a>: Yeah, I'm going to put them together in a document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=524.466s">[Hays]</a>: That was my plan was to have that ready for today, but they were just, it was, I didn't have enough time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=566.022s">[Hays]</a>: Pretty much across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=567.123s">[Hays]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=567.423s">[Hays]</a>: When you look at that and we can scroll down through the rest of them, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=570.666s">[Hays]</a>: But well, these are the these are the three the three main areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=576.571s">[Hays]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=576.871s">[Hays]</a>: These are the three where we all had to take all of our scores and and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=583.314s">[Hays]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=586.696s">[Hays]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=617.912s">[Hays]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=618.852s">[Hays]</a>: Thank you, that was a good way to summarize it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=640.277s">[Hays]</a>: Uh, in terms of the comments from members, yes, we can either I mean, we can either work on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=649.13s">[Hays]</a>: here or here if we can get them to all together into a document or we can we do have another subcommittee meeting scheduled where we could look at that and I think what we had said as part of the process was that the subcommittee would would put selected comments in to kind of represent the ratings that we would select comments from the various members evaluations and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=677.977s">[Hays]</a>: create the composite, including the comments to bring to the whole committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=724.419s">[Hays]</a>: Yeah, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=725.22s">[Hays]</a>: That's a really good suggestion, because as I said,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=728.85s">[Hays]</a>: I'd envisioned having it ready for this meeting and we could actually just do it together at this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=734.012s">[Hays]</a>: But given that that, you know, the time frame didn't allow for that, maybe that's the best way to move forward is to create the finish creating that Google Doc, which I've already started, but just haven't been able to finish.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=747.979s">[Hays]</a>: And like you said, I can share that with you and member Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=750.3s">[Hays]</a>: And when we meet on April 1st, I believe it is, we could probably have a pretty<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=757.778s">[Hays]</a>: efficient meeting in terms of choosing out the comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=764.76s">[Hays]</a>: I'm sorry, I keep saying April today for some reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=767.701s">[Hays]</a>: Yes, June 1st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=769.321s">[Hays]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=769.761s">[Hays]</a>: That's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=773.122s">[Hays]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=774.463s">[Hays]</a>: Do we want to scroll down and you can see some of the other, we can view some of the other scores just so people have an idea of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=783.797s">[Hays]</a>: where some of these fell out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=785.078s">[Hays]</a>: These are the specific, the superintendent's specific goals, early literacy, her professional practice goal, and her three district improvement goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=808.272s">[Hays]</a>: I mean, this is really just, I just pulled the data straight out from everyone's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=813.263s">[Hays]</a>: individual evaluations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=815.666s">[Hays]</a>: And you can see it really all does fall kind of in that middle, the met range.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=823.755s">[Hays]</a>: And then these are the individual standards and the indicators of how people vote rated on the indicators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=882.329s">[Hays]</a>: So I guess from here do we need to make a motion that will that that would be the next step would be that I'll send um create the combined uh the document of combined comments and uh<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=898.425s">[Hays]</a>: We'll meet next time and go through those to fill in the comment sections of the composite.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=906.889s">[Hays]</a>: Member Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=929.302s">[Hays]</a>: Oh, she just texted me that she can't be unmuted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=932.673s">[Hays]</a>: She can't unmute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=934.177s">[Hays]</a>: Let me, let me see what I can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=981.166s">[Hays]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=981.947s">[Hays]</a>: So do we, I don't know, do we need to vote on that or is that more formal than we need to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1060.873s">[Hays]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1062.114s">[Hays]</a>: Well, does anyone have anything else to add about this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1065.255s">[Hays]</a>: I guess at this point, the data is in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1070.476s">[Hays]</a>: It really is just that question of adding in the comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1100.091s">[Hays]</a>: Well, I will be getting that to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1101.731s">[Hays]</a>: I mean, I'll be getting the finishing, completing the Google Doc that's already in the, it's in the shared folder I already sent you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1112.073s">[Hays]</a>: I don't know that, I think that actually the next meeting is for us to together create the, decide upon the comments to go in the comment section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1122.536s">[Hays]</a>: So I'm not really sure there's any, I don't think there's anything you need to send to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1139.145s">[Hays]</a>: Is Jess able to unmute, or is she?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1161.358s">[Hays]</a>: This is a school committee process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1163.86s">[Hays]</a>: The school committee is responsible for evaluating the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1172.868s">[Hays]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1173.369s">[Hays]</a>: I don't know if anyone had anything to add to that, if there was anything I missed about community input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1181.416s">[Hays]</a>: In terms of actual writing of the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1186.431s">[Hays]</a>: the superintendent evaluation, that is our responsibility in terms of community input, that would probably be more through any evidence that the superintendent provides for us of community input on any of the areas that she's being evaluated on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1203.799s">[Hays]</a>: Is that correct to say, yes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1316.556s">[Hays]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1317.816s">[Hays]</a>: Yes, I think we're always looking for ways to improve the process and improve our ways of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1323.527s">[Hays]</a>: getting information to evaluate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1326.508s">[Hays]</a>: So I think that as member Graham said, looking for a way to include the community in the process would certainly be a next step, a next goal for next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1336.549s">[Hays]</a>: That being said, if there are any, not any other questions from either the committee or from any members of the public?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1352.5s">[Hays]</a>: Oh, thank you, I didn't see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1361.048s">[Hays]</a>: Yes, Mr. Garrity, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1367.153s">[Hays]</a>: Okay, that's someone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1370.796s">[Hays]</a>: Superintendent, are you able to unmute him?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1408.629s">[Hays]</a>: Sure, good question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1409.809s">[Hays]</a>: Well, we use the self-evaluation from the superintendent, where she gives us an update on, it's all based on the goals that the superintendent and the school committee discussed at the beginning of the year, the agreed upon goals and indicators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1428.275s">[Hays]</a>: And so the superintendent presented her self-evaluation two weeks ago, and that's the information that we use to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1437.332s">[Hays]</a>: complete our evaluations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1439.713s">[Hays]</a>: Does any other member have something more to add to that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1507.768s">[Hays]</a>: I'm not, can you further explain what the question is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1837.922s">[Hays]</a>: And I would just add, I think that at our meeting, when we present this to the entire committee for them to vote on the final composite,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1845.96s">[Hays]</a>: I think at that point, we will talk as a committee about how exactly we want to share this, what's the best way to share this so that everyone has access to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1855.245s">[Hays]</a>: We've talked about a couple of different ways of possibly putting it on the website and making sure that everyone has access to both the composite, but also our individual evaluations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1870.353s">[Hays]</a>: Because as both member Graham and member McLaughlin have said, it's all public information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1876.743s">[Hays]</a>: Desi doesn't specify how we share it or how we make it public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1881.664s">[Hays]</a>: So that's really up to us to make that decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1883.785s">[Hays]</a>: And I've looked around at other districts and it's remarkably difficult actually to find in many districts to find the superintendent evaluation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=1893.588s">[Hays]</a>: So it's really kind of up to us to create that process and decide how we wanna share it and create that access for the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=2019.482s">[Hays]</a>: I think it's also important, which is also publicly available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=2023.364s">[Hays]</a>: Again, the superintendent's goals for the year that are posted, and they're also goals that are shared goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=2031.408s">[Hays]</a>: We work on them together, the superintendent and the school committee at the beginning of the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=2035.89s">[Hays]</a>: So that's really where the, I don't know if the metrics so much, but the decisions about what are the particular focus areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=2045.372s">[Hays]</a>: that is done, again, in open meeting, and it's also a document that's on the website that everyone can look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=2056.916s">[Hays]</a>: Good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=2057.997s">[Hays]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=2059.165s">[Hays]</a>: Member McLaughlin, your hand's up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=2060.366s">[Hays]</a>: Did you have something else to add?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=2061.726s">[Hays]</a>: I did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=2112.07s">[Hays]</a>: That would be great because I am, oh sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=2113.531s">[Hays]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=2115.372s">[Hays]</a>: Just wanted to say, I'm still, as I said, I'm still working on some of the other pieces so it would be helpful if.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=2120.775s">[Hays]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=2121.842s">[Hays]</a>: someone maybe could pick up that piece of it, that creation of the slide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=2124.805s">[Hays]</a>: Yeah, I'd be happy to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=2155.476s">[Hays]</a>: Second, I'll take a roll call vote then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=2160.156s">[Hays]</a>: Member Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=2161.357s">[Hays]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=2162.697s">[Hays]</a>: Member McLaughlin?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=2164.037s">[Hays]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=2165.057s">[Hays]</a>: Member Hays?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=2165.857s">[Hays]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=2166.578s">[Hays]</a>: Three in the affirmative, zero in the negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=2169.518s">[Hays]</a>: So this meeting is then, do we have to also adjourn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=2172.18s">[Hays]</a>: Continued.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=2172.741s">[Hays]</a>: Nope, we're continued.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/-GdGrA4wKuQ&t=2173.662s">[Hays]</a>: Continued, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5291.786s">[Hays]</a>: What's that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16040.05s">[Hays]</a>: Sharon Hayes 69 Ripley Road think I'm more nervous on this side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16046.813s">[Hays]</a>: I'm not here to advocate for any particular position or program, because as a parent I realized that every single one of these cuts will affect my children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16060.199s">[Hays]</a>: directly or indirectly, immediately or in the future as a long-term impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16065.203s">[Hays]</a>: And that's true for all of our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16069.806s">[Hays]</a>: As a parent of an elementary school student who's at the largest school with the currently largest class size, I can echo the worries that the Missittook has about what larger class size, what the impact is on students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16089.646s">[Hays]</a>: We similarly, at the Roberts, in our class sizes of 20 or more, there are a bunch of classes that have some significant emotional behavioral needs, ones that don't qualify for special education supports, but who need supports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16109.023s">[Hays]</a>: And as a school district, we have been lean for a very long time, and so,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16115.31s">[Hays]</a>: We also don't have those extra supports that a lot of other schools, other school districts might have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16123.272s">[Hays]</a>: We don't have a lot of reading specialists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16125.713s">[Hays]</a>: We don't have math specialists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16129.194s">[Hays]</a>: We don't have probably as many adjustment Councilors as we need, given the needs of our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16135.936s">[Hays]</a>: So when you then increase class sizes, and even if it's only by one, two, three students,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16143.041s">[Hays]</a>: The impact on the students, the impact on the teachers is huge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16148.162s">[Hays]</a>: And we know that across the country and certainly in our district, teachers are burned out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16154.543s">[Hays]</a>: And if you then add to that by increasing the class sizes, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16161.084s">[Hays]</a>: I'm also the parent of a marching band student, orchestra student, a regular band student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16171.673s">[Hays]</a>: I know the impact that that will have if we cut anywhere in the performing arts, any position that's going to necessarily have a ripple effect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16186.182s">[Hays]</a>: Again, I could go through any of these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16187.662s">[Hays]</a>: One more, just I took some notes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16189.784s">[Hays]</a>: When I think of the nursing staff,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16193.035s">[Hays]</a>: I can say from personal experience where my kids were very little.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16196.897s">[Hays]</a>: Both of them had some real school anxiety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16200.599s">[Hays]</a>: And when they needed a break from the classroom where they had somatic responses to their anxiety, where did the teacher send them to the nurse's office, not because they were sick, but because that was a place they could have a break.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16214.755s">[Hays]</a>: Maybe they could lie down on one of the little beds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16216.997s">[Hays]</a>: They got a little TLC from the nurses who were absolutely amazing, who would call me and say, you know, your child's here, but he's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16225.302s">[Hays]</a>: Just want you to know that he's here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16229.085s">[Hays]</a>: So it kind of, as I was sitting back there, you know, my stomach started to twist just hearing people come up and, you know, everybody's fighting for the pennies and the nickels and the dimes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16246.061s">[Hays]</a>: I think we as a community and I know I think member Graham said this earlier, and I think every school can remember said this at some point, we need to come together and decide how much do we value our educational system, how much do we value our public schools, and what are we willing to do to fund them to a level that meets that value that we get from them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16269.693s">[Hays]</a>: And so I hope people will take away from this not just<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16274.755s">[Hays]</a>: You know my, my program may be cut that my child's in or, you know, something in particular my child needs is being cut, but as a whole, our school system is being decimated, which might be a little strong but we're being cut after cut year after year there are positions that the school committee, I can say having been on the school<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16296.565s">[Hays]</a>: wanted, not just wanted, but felt were really necessary to really have a high quality education for our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16304.972s">[Hays]</a>: And they would get cut, those positions like literacy specialists would get cut very early in the budget season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16311.236s">[Hays]</a>: So the people who walk away from this just thinking about what do we do to make sure we have more money in the future?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16319.002s">[Hays]</a>: I hope people will walk away with that because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16323.277s">[Hays]</a>: This isn't gonna get solved by one program being reinstated or one teacher being reinstated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16328.601s">[Hays]</a>: This is going to, I think, as member Rousseau asked and as Gerry McCue answered, this is gonna happen again next year if we don't do something about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16339.969s">[Hays]</a>: We're gonna be back in these meetings talking about what positions are we gonna cut now and what impact is that gonna have on our kids and our teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16348.015s">[Hays]</a>: So I hope people think a lot about that and think about what we need<br><br>
