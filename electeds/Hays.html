    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=332.329s">[Hays]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10481.801s">[Hays]</a>: Sharon Hayes, 69 Ripley Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10484.182s">[Hays]</a>: I had a question about one specific thing that was mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10489.264s">[Hays]</a>: The replacement for the response to intervention, that was really a huge rollout, I remember.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10495.707s">[Hays]</a>: At least, was it last year or the year before?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10497.888s">[Hays]</a>: And I know I was specifically very interested in it because as an educator myself, I've been involved in response and intervention<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10505.379s">[Hays]</a>: in other cities and towns and it's a really good process for identifying students who need extra support and then making sure you follow up in a set amount of time to see if they need to go further, if they need more support, if they need to be tested for special education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10520.206s">[Hays]</a>: So I'm a little concerned to hear that that's being dropped or being morphed into something else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10526.175s">[Hays]</a>: Well, I guess I'm wondering, is there going to be a description of what that is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10530.157s">[Hays]</a>: Because I've never heard of this new one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10532.098s">[Hays]</a>: I don't know if it's specific to Medford or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10534.539s">[Hays]</a>: But like I said, I know the response to intervention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10536.54s">[Hays]</a>: I know it works well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10537.621s">[Hays]</a>: So personally, I'm a little concerned to hear it's being changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10540.922s">[Hays]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10660.375s">[Hays]</a>: Sharon, you can come on up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10663.076s">[Hays]</a>: And this is probably more, maybe it's going to be discussed at another meeting in more depth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10667.439s">[Hays]</a>: I just know that there were a lot of questions and issues with how to even implement the RTI piece of it, in terms of having staffing to do all of the pieces of it, in terms of going into the classrooms, doing observations, and then providing whatever supports were needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10684.321s">[Hays]</a>: Again, I'm just curious now that it's going to be even a broader process or include more types of interventions or more types of needs, how that's going to be implemented, given that my understanding was RTI has not even been completely implemented yet, the academic piece of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10702.014s">[Hays]</a>: So that's...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10704.505s">[Hays]</a>: Kind of what I'm wondering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10705.225s">[Hays]</a>: I don't know if there's going to be another meeting to talk about it in more depth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4OupiMzprjU&t=10950.424s">[Hays]</a>: We did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8451.221s">[Hays]</a>: Member Hays.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8452.842s">[Hays]</a>: I guess I'd want to add to that, I think another piece that you mentioned, and I don't think you deliberately mentioned it quickly, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8458.871s">[Hays]</a>: the having instructional support coaches as much as the professional development is important, that ongoing support to teachers where they can troubleshoot when they're trying it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8471.261s">[Hays]</a>: You know, you can't do that in a one day professional or even a five day professional development because things happen as you're teaching something and you need to understand how to tweak it or change it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8481.289s">[Hays]</a>: So I think balancing out, if we're talking about how we're going to spend money, you know, instructional support coaches versus<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8489.133s">[Hays]</a>: professional development or do we have the money for it all?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8491.775s">[Hays]</a>: But I just don't want to, I don't want to go over that lightly because you did mention that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8496.138s">[Hays]</a>: And I think that that is incredibly important and something not to be overlooked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8500.38s">[Hays]</a>: I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5291.786s">[Hays]</a>: What's that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16040.05s">[Hays]</a>: Sharon Hayes 69 Ripley Road think I'm more nervous on this side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16046.813s">[Hays]</a>: I'm not here to advocate for any particular position or program, because as a parent I realized that every single one of these cuts will affect my children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16060.199s">[Hays]</a>: directly or indirectly, immediately or in the future as a long-term impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16065.203s">[Hays]</a>: And that's true for all of our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16069.806s">[Hays]</a>: As a parent of an elementary school student who's at the largest school with the currently largest class size, I can echo the worries that the Missittook has about what larger class size, what the impact is on students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16089.646s">[Hays]</a>: We similarly, at the Roberts, in our class sizes of 20 or more, there are a bunch of classes that have some significant emotional behavioral needs, ones that don't qualify for special education supports, but who need supports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16109.023s">[Hays]</a>: And as a school district, we have been lean for a very long time, and so,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16115.31s">[Hays]</a>: We also don't have those extra supports that a lot of other schools, other school districts might have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16123.272s">[Hays]</a>: We don't have a lot of reading specialists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16125.713s">[Hays]</a>: We don't have math specialists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16129.194s">[Hays]</a>: We don't have probably as many adjustment Councilors as we need, given the needs of our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16135.936s">[Hays]</a>: So when you then increase class sizes, and even if it's only by one, two, three students,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16143.041s">[Hays]</a>: The impact on the students, the impact on the teachers is huge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16148.162s">[Hays]</a>: And we know that across the country and certainly in our district, teachers are burned out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16154.543s">[Hays]</a>: And if you then add to that by increasing the class sizes, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16161.084s">[Hays]</a>: I'm also the parent of a marching band student, orchestra student, a regular band student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16171.673s">[Hays]</a>: I know the impact that that will have if we cut anywhere in the performing arts, any position that's going to necessarily have a ripple effect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16186.182s">[Hays]</a>: Again, I could go through any of these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16187.662s">[Hays]</a>: One more, just I took some notes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16189.784s">[Hays]</a>: When I think of the nursing staff,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16193.035s">[Hays]</a>: I can say from personal experience where my kids were very little.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16196.897s">[Hays]</a>: Both of them had some real school anxiety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16200.599s">[Hays]</a>: And when they needed a break from the classroom where they had somatic responses to their anxiety, where did the teacher send them to the nurse's office, not because they were sick, but because that was a place they could have a break.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16214.755s">[Hays]</a>: Maybe they could lie down on one of the little beds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16216.997s">[Hays]</a>: They got a little TLC from the nurses who were absolutely amazing, who would call me and say, you know, your child's here, but he's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16225.302s">[Hays]</a>: Just want you to know that he's here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16229.085s">[Hays]</a>: So it kind of, as I was sitting back there, you know, my stomach started to twist just hearing people come up and, you know, everybody's fighting for the pennies and the nickels and the dimes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16246.061s">[Hays]</a>: I think we as a community and I know I think member Graham said this earlier, and I think every school can remember said this at some point, we need to come together and decide how much do we value our educational system, how much do we value our public schools, and what are we willing to do to fund them to a level that meets that value that we get from them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16269.693s">[Hays]</a>: And so I hope people will take away from this not just<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16274.755s">[Hays]</a>: You know my, my program may be cut that my child's in or, you know, something in particular my child needs is being cut, but as a whole, our school system is being decimated, which might be a little strong but we're being cut after cut year after year there are positions that the school committee, I can say having been on the school<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16296.565s">[Hays]</a>: wanted, not just wanted, but felt were really necessary to really have a high quality education for our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16304.972s">[Hays]</a>: And they would get cut, those positions like literacy specialists would get cut very early in the budget season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16311.236s">[Hays]</a>: So the people who walk away from this just thinking about what do we do to make sure we have more money in the future?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16319.002s">[Hays]</a>: I hope people will walk away with that because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16323.277s">[Hays]</a>: This isn't gonna get solved by one program being reinstated or one teacher being reinstated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16328.601s">[Hays]</a>: This is going to, I think, as member Rousseau asked and as Gerry McCue answered, this is gonna happen again next year if we don't do something about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16339.969s">[Hays]</a>: We're gonna be back in these meetings talking about what positions are we gonna cut now and what impact is that gonna have on our kids and our teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=16348.015s">[Hays]</a>: So I hope people think a lot about that and think about what we need<br><br>
