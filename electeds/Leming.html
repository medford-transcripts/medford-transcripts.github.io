    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=14.0s">[Leming]</a>: Present<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2343.294s">[Leming]</a>: This is more just a curiosity question, but with the health insurance, is there any possibility or is it feasible at all to switch health insurance providers or is that just a non-starter?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4298.474s">[Leming]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=6037.057s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=6039.138s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=43.0s">[Leming]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=45.762s">[Leming]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=293.299s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=398.281s">[Leming]</a>: I found them in order and motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6778.937s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6779.678s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Lemming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6781.919s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you, council president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6784.561s">[Leming]</a>: It is so much easier to criticize action than it is inaction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6791.546s">[Leming]</a>: And unfortunately for decades, this city<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6799.005s">[Leming]</a>: has really not done a whole lot to address the structural underfunding that has led up to this fiscal cliff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6810.549s">[Leming]</a>: I want to be extremely clear that if this override doesn't pass, as the mayor said, we will be here next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6818.953s">[Leming]</a>: We will have to lay a lot of people off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6823.138s">[Leming]</a>: The roads will continue to be in the state they're in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6826.101s">[Leming]</a>: And as my colleague said, they will continue to get worse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6830.647s">[Leming]</a>: The fire department will not get its headquarters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6833.851s">[Leming]</a>: We need this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6837.222s">[Leming]</a>: as Council Vice President Collins said, this is the most important vote that is coming before this Council tonight, that has come before this Council so far this term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6848.677s">[Leming]</a>: Now, I don't know what it means to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6853.464s">[Leming]</a>: do an override right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6854.605s">[Leming]</a>: I'm sure that they've had, that they've done it differently in other cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6858.048s">[Leming]</a>: And I know that my colleagues on council, my colleagues on school committee and the mayor may have slightly different views on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6865.535s">[Leming]</a>: They announced the financial task force months ago via press release.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6869.358s">[Leming]</a>: It was never a secret committee and they had to work out a compromise to bring what we're seeing today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6877.671s">[Leming]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6878.631s">[Leming]</a>: And I'm not going to sit here and criticize people who are trying to address the issues that people have been talking about in this city for decades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6891.294s">[Leming]</a>: And I'm sure that a lot of people will come around and say, you know, we need more development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6897.776s">[Leming]</a>: We need to work, do more with less, whatever that means.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6905.158s">[Leming]</a>: We need to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6906.997s">[Leming]</a>: I mean, we're already down to the bone, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6910.698s">[Leming]</a>: I've been to the school committee budget meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6914.32s">[Leming]</a>: They've already stripped the school budget down as far as it can possibly go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6919.401s">[Leming]</a>: If this doesn't pass, we don't know what we'll do next year, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6923.663s">[Leming]</a>: So I just wanna make the point that this is, I think, any kind of action, any kind of action<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6933.348s">[Leming]</a>: any kind of choice that the voters have, that we can give the voters is praiseworthy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6939.192s">[Leming]</a>: I commend my colleagues for doing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6942.634s">[Leming]</a>: This is going to be historic in this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6945.516s">[Leming]</a>: This is what we need right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6949.739s">[Leming]</a>: And big picture, I just want to really drive that point home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6954.902s">[Leming]</a>: You know, unity is not doing what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6961.021s">[Leming]</a>: the loudest people in the room say we should do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6964.366s">[Leming]</a>: Unity is fixing the problems that the vast majority of the city have told us about, even if our solutions aren't perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6976.226s">[Leming]</a>: thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6977.207s">[Leming]</a>: I heard a, I heard a groan in the audience when council, when the council president listed the large amount of speakers that, uh, that still had to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6987.474s">[Leming]</a>: And so I think everybody wants to get to public comment period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6990.396s">[Leming]</a>: So I'm going to leave it at that and thank all those who've spoken so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6994.759s">[Leming]</a>: And I look forward to hearing what folks have to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7742.773s">[Leming]</a>: No, this is just a quick one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7743.935s">[Leming]</a>: So Councilor Scarpelli brought up twice or several times the fact that his<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7749.929s">[Leming]</a>: previous paper was was a rule 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7753.05s">[Leming]</a>: I just want to be clear about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7755.291s">[Leming]</a>: So first off, if anybody would like to look at the May 28th meeting, the city council meetings are now on YouTube.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7762.173s">[Leming]</a>: So you're free to look up how that particular debate went.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7766.054s">[Leming]</a>: But I rule 21 that because it was a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7770.916s">[Leming]</a>: vague resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7772.037s">[Leming]</a>: It was just to generally discuss options for the school budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7778.142s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli had previously submitted a similar resolution several meetings before, and he was asked by the council president to make his resolutions more specific so that people would know what he specifically intended to bring to the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7792.934s">[Leming]</a>: The last one was a resolution to discuss subcommittee processes, and it ended up in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7800.425s">[Leming]</a>: Um, it ended up veering into a letter that my colleagues had signed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7805.248s">[Leming]</a>: Um, so it just generally got off topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7808.65s">[Leming]</a>: So I just wanted to clarify that I wanted the resolutions of themselves to be specific so that we will know what is being talked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7818.536s">[Leming]</a>: We could have talked about that resolution today, but my colleague decided to withdraw it, um, at the beginning of the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7826.06s">[Leming]</a>: So we never did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14593.293s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14745.696s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=540.274s">[Leming]</a>: Just like to say that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=544.115s">[Leming]</a>: When I was a member of the CPA, Tom Lincoln, he was one of our frequent customers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=552.56s">[Leming]</a>: He just brought in application after application to repair the Brooks Estate, and he's the driving force behind the upkeep of that property today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=562.985s">[Leming]</a>: This is just a case of an<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=566.707s">[Leming]</a>: ordinary citizen of Medford, seeing something that they wanted preserved, seeing a project that they could really get behind, and putting their time and energy into it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=577.116s">[Leming]</a>: And it's really paid off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=578.777s">[Leming]</a>: I look forward to telling Mr. Lincoln how much I admire him when he does come to the next city council meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=589.005s">[Leming]</a>: Congratulations, Mr. Lincoln.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=591.127s">[Leming]</a>: You're a great citizen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=592.548s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1155.006s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Lemming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1156.479s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1157.16s">[Leming]</a>: Just keep mine short and I'll say Sylvia, we love you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1160.605s">[Leming]</a>: We'll miss you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1161.646s">[Leming]</a>: We'll miss your humor and your presence in the clerk's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1168.055s">[Leming]</a>: I don't think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1169.844s">[Leming]</a>: The clerks often get enough credit for all the work that they do behind the scenes and all the institutional knowledge that they bring to City Council and City Hall and the help either just with purely procedural stuff or just with moral support when we've had a rough evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1191.318s">[Leming]</a>: And Sylvia will be dearly missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1194.42s">[Leming]</a>: That being said, enjoy retirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1197.242s">[Leming]</a>: Have a good time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1198.323s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=5939.871s">[Leming]</a>: I'd just like to say, it looks like you've assembled a real dream team here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=5945.857s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you very much for... No, I'm serious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=5951.502s">[Leming]</a>: I looked through the descriptions of everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=5958.462s">[Leming]</a>: I know that I spent a lot of time just focusing on, you know, trying to find good people for the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=5964.406s">[Leming]</a>: It looks like everybody here is far, far more qualified than<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=5971.414s">[Leming]</a>: when it comes to anything related to affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=5975.156s">[Leming]</a>: And thank you so much for your efforts in assembling these six people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=5981.658s">[Leming]</a>: I know that they'll do fantastic work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=5987.1s">[Leming]</a>: I look forward to recommendations from these folks when it comes to both any affordable housing policy ideas and ways to get money into the trust fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=5998.904s">[Leming]</a>: So just,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=5999.824s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you for your efforts and that's all I got.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6002.795s">[Leming]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6270.642s">[Leming]</a>: Just wanted to say, I remember back when I was getting my appointment to the CPA,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6281.525s">[Leming]</a>: I remember I waited in this room until about one, one o'clock in the morning, watching a very good meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6291.111s">[Leming]</a>: It was a great meeting, but also just say that when I saw at his name on the, on the agenda, I was kind of thinking like, you know, I really don't want to have somebody else go through that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6303.539s">[Leming]</a>: That's, that's not, not always the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6307.441s">[Leming]</a>: most pleasant thing to go through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6308.681s">[Leming]</a>: So I was kind of behind the scenes asking folks to do that, to move this paper out of order just so that she didn't also have to wait till one in the morning to get appointed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6321.206s">[Leming]</a>: But just wanted to say right over your resume, I think it's wonderful to have a social worker with heights of the community on the CPA and I know you'll do good work there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6334.331s">[Leming]</a>: So yeah, that's all I got.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11254.315s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11254.556s">[Leming]</a>: I would just like to thank you for figures two and three, which very clearly show the amount that has been matched by the state every year since 2018.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11263.88s">[Leming]</a>: Um, as well as figure three, which very clearly shows that historically they're 29% of CPA funds have gone towards affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11274.165s">[Leming]</a>: I would recommend modestly that maybe the color coding is could be updated because we get these in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11283.09s">[Leming]</a>: It looks beautiful in the PDF.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11284.491s">[Leming]</a>: It looks absolutely wonderful, very clear in the online PDF.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11288.453s">[Leming]</a>: But I will say that just in the printed version, it's not quite clear that the state matching has been very consistent year to year, in spite of what has often been said in these chambers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11300.62s">[Leming]</a>: So thank you very much for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12449.913s">[Leming]</a>: So just two questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12451.995s">[Leming]</a>: So to clarify, if somebody wanted to build an ADU on their house and they lived in a historic district, then you would require that the ADU be built with materials similar to the one that are used to currently construct the house?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12465.764s">[Leming]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12466.165s">[Leming]</a>: The other one, and I've kind of been curious about this ever since I first saw this map a couple of months ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12473.42s">[Leming]</a>: Could you talk about the houses between, I believe it's 84 and 102, or are they just like newer buildings?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12498.186s">[Leming]</a>: Oh, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12499.106s">[Leming]</a>: Use your arrow keys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12500.027s">[Leming]</a>: You can go back with the arrow key.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13970.862s">[Leming]</a>: I just have one question for the members of the Historic District Commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13974.844s">[Leming]</a>: When you were deciding which district to choose for those, what other areas were you sort of considering?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13983.49s">[Leming]</a>: And can you just delve a little bit more into the specific rationale for choosing South Street?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14543.299s">[Leming]</a>: I feel like we need a bit more of an extensive presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15171.179s">[Leming]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15841.854s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Lemming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15842.674s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15845.66s">[Leming]</a>: I don't want to meditate too much on this, but I would like to clarify because I said that I talked to the administration about free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15854.486s">[Leming]</a>: And I want to clarify what I mean when I say that I talked to the administration is I Googled Bob Dickinson, the finance director's phone number, left him a voicemail, and then he got back to me and we talked for like, you know, half an hour about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15869.736s">[Leming]</a>: free cash, because when I saw, you know, $9 million, I was kind of like, what's going on here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15874.598s">[Leming]</a>: And so then, you know, the finance director has been working in this area for years, and me, who, as an elected official, doesn't suddenly mean that I know everything about finance, I talked to him about it, I asked my questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15887.563s">[Leming]</a>: And he explained, you know, what the situation was, it's not a simple issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15893.306s">[Leming]</a>: Cities are kind of on a one year delay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15895.146s">[Leming]</a>: So in many ways, we're dealing now with what was budgeted last year, and we are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15899.008s">[Leming]</a>: going to be in our budget, and we're trying to predict what the budget will be next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15902.191s">[Leming]</a>: They always come up with conservative estimates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15903.812s">[Leming]</a>: Part of the free cash comes from the fact that the police department couldn't hire 10 police officers, so that's $800,000 extra in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15912.119s">[Leming]</a>: Obviously, if we want to be able to fill those positions, that is not revenue that we can expect to come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15918.525s">[Leming]</a>: next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15919.326s">[Leming]</a>: Part of it just came from poor, inaccurate estimations in previous years of what healthcare costs would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15925.473s">[Leming]</a>: Those things are always hard to predict.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15929.939s">[Leming]</a>: And part of this is the fact that we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15933.263s">[Leming]</a>: implement, you know, we have these one time very big studies to try to invest in our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15938.811s">[Leming]</a>: Obviously, we're debating many of those tonight costs like 15 million bucks to replace the HVAC systems for the middle school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15946.381s">[Leming]</a>: So we need to, we need to spend, we need to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15950.106s">[Leming]</a>: fix that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15951.628s">[Leming]</a>: And we can't just say, Oh, here's $9 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15953.85s">[Leming]</a>: Well, we should use that on salaries, continuing costs, which will just sink, which will just like eat up all of that money in a couple of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15964.34s">[Leming]</a>: So, you know, in order to appropriately finance the city, it's not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15969.645s">[Leming]</a>: It's not an easy thing to explain, but at the end of the day, free cash goes to one-time costs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15974.287s">[Leming]</a>: You cannot count on it as an ongoing source of revenue, especially to handle salaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15979.61s">[Leming]</a>: The other thing to note is that being an elected official doesn't mean that people will suddenly make an effort to call me<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15992.717s">[Leming]</a>: to give me information and include me in on things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15995.398s">[Leming]</a>: It's my job to go out and seek that information and try to educate myself on things that happen, you know, just because, you know, being elected basically means that I get to sit in the seat and talk for however long I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16012.745s">[Leming]</a>: I'm allowed to, and vote on ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16018.489s">[Leming]</a>: If I was not involved in the financial task force in order to figure out how things work, any city councilor can do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16026.495s">[Leming]</a>: You call up somebody, you seek out that information, you build up those relationships, and if you choose not to do that, then you won't be included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16034.181s">[Leming]</a>: That's just how it works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16035.682s">[Leming]</a>: So I'd just like to clarify that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16038.444s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19005.427s">[Leming]</a>: Part of this that gives me pause is the fact that Medford, the mayor's chair of the school committee and so I mean I know that that's two different positions but by two legally different positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19018.554s">[Leming]</a>: I, yeah, I, I know but the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19024.183s">[Leming]</a>: it could change if the charter changes, but effectively the person who is occupying both the position as mayor and the position as head of the school committee in Medford are the same person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19039.517s">[Leming]</a>: And so the chair of the school committee did get a raise already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19047.964s">[Leming]</a>: And so that's,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19050.649s">[Leming]</a>: That's I'd say that I'd say that that's the part that that's that's the one part of this that does give me that does give me some pause the logic of having not received an increase in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19062.985s">[Leming]</a>: 10 years, that does make sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19066.329s">[Leming]</a>: But the person who is essentially doing the job that they have done that whole time has received a raise that we approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19078.762s">[Leming]</a>: So that's the only part of this that I'm questioning right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1338.49s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1339.49s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, I see these photos and they look horrifying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1342.852s">[Leming]</a>: So thank you for putting in this request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1345.513s">[Leming]</a>: Just only question, you said that these are 40 years old, are the new telephone poles that you plan to install, what is the expected shelf life for those?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1899.063s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you, I'd just like to know, could this funding have come from the CPA and are there other Brooks Estate projects at the moment with active CPA funding?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1943.649s">[Leming]</a>: Got it, so this is an historic preservation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1945.771s">[Leming]</a>: I think that clarified my question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1947.912s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1952.576s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2238.732s">[Leming]</a>: No, I didn't entirely follow that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2241.633s">[Leming]</a>: I would motion to approve and send this to regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2586.004s">[Leming]</a>: Motion to approve and send to committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2589.627s">[Leming]</a>: Motion to regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2770.646s">[Leming]</a>: Rose, we had a we had a very short city council meeting, but sorry, I wanted to, I just wanted to add on to what Zach was saying about the long term financial plan of the city, which was a lot of what city council doing is right<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2788.795s">[Leming]</a>: Right now, is establishing sort of the instruments of municipal finance and governance that other surrounding towns have sort of taken for granted for a very long time and I don't think that's always obvious to people who are looking in a good example is the stabilization funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2807.601s">[Leming]</a>: you know, we decided to create a couple of rainy day funds and allocate some cash into them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2815.203s">[Leming]</a>: And that's something that the vast majority of cities in Massachusetts have had forever that this city council only recently actually instituted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2825.285s">[Leming]</a>: Only last year we established an affordable housing trust so that we put some money towards affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2830.707s">[Leming]</a>: That was something that Somerville established like 30 years ago and it's been collecting money ever<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2837.563s">[Leming]</a>: ever since.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2839.865s">[Leming]</a>: Our zoning really should have been overhauled a very long time ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2845.971s">[Leming]</a>: With regards to a lot of the HR issues that were just being discussed earlier, that's not just a case for getting retrograde, it's not just a case for the teachers union, it's a case for all<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2859.262s">[Leming]</a>: pretty much all city staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2861.163s">[Leming]</a>: We asked HR that during a meeting a couple months ago, and they said they don't have the financial software to do those calculations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2870.165s">[Leming]</a>: They literally have to calculate everything by hand on paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2873.926s">[Leming]</a>: That's not something that most other organizations have to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2879.668s">[Leming]</a>: A lot of our long-term financial planning, just to be clear, is establishing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2887.543s">[Leming]</a>: be, it's just getting things that other areas have taken for granted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2892.204s">[Leming]</a>: So I just wanted to make that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2894.265s">[Leming]</a>: I'll get off the panel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=927.982s">[Leming]</a>: I had a question on Medford's current definition of dormitories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=935.827s">[Leming]</a>: And I'm just trying to get an idea for myself of the practical cases where these different definitions would differ.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=944.465s">[Leming]</a>: Our current one is building designed for or occupied as a residence for students or staff owned by or under the supervision of an institution or an educational use which is not operated as a gainful business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=958.168s">[Leming]</a>: With the wording for that, could that be understood as, could you like have an apartment complex or a house which is owned by an institution of some sort, even like a private equity firm, but ends up housing mostly students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=978.28s">[Leming]</a>: Would that be reclassified as dormitory under our current ordinances?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1178.478s">[Leming]</a>: I think my other concern with this definition is specified building designed by or occupied as a residence for students or staff so it's that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1188.891s">[Leming]</a>: It's that or right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1189.971s">[Leming]</a>: So what I'm thinking is that one year it could be occupied by all renters who are working in Boston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1198.574s">[Leming]</a>: They all move out and then a bunch of students move in there and suddenly it's reclassified as a dormitory automatically just because it might not have been designed for that purpose, but now they're occupied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1210.538s">[Leming]</a>: It's now occupied by them that you see what I'm saying there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1260.414s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, I'm just trying to understand how... I'm just trying to go over the implications of the current definition, just add food for thought for changing it in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1467.044s">[Leming]</a>: Well, I could make that as a motion, but I would like to bring up with the Cambridge definition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1474.849s">[Leming]</a>: Director Hunt, what do you think of the idea of striking the phrase for persons whose permanent residence is elsewhere?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1548.241s">[Leming]</a>: So I guess I'll motion to adopt the Cambridge definition of a dormitory striking the words for persons whose permanent residence is elsewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1560.532s">[Leming]</a>: And.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1562.133s">[Leming]</a>: And.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1566.217s">[Leming]</a>: So striking whose permanent residence is elsewhere and.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1612.974s">[Leming]</a>: Just whose permanent residence is elsewhere and.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=122.134s">[Leming]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1714.838s">[Leming]</a>: I'm going to try to respond to one thing there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1716.578s">[Leming]</a>: I didn't hear a specific question, but you did say that Medford's not like our surrounding towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1724.02s">[Leming]</a>: No, I said Winchester.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1725.081s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, we're not like Winchester.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1726.521s">[Leming]</a>: 90% of cities in the state of Massachusetts have had an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1732.203s">[Leming]</a>: Medford has one of the lowest operating budgets per capita of any city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1741.625s">[Leming]</a>: midsize city in the state of Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1744.446s">[Leming]</a>: And that is in large part because we are one of the 10% of cities that has never had an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1751.749s">[Leming]</a>: So you're right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1752.409s">[Leming]</a>: We are not like our neighbors that have had overrides and we have less money for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2282.138s">[Leming]</a>: Saying that we can address the budgetary problems of the Medford public school system with free cash is like me saying the government gave me a $1,200 check from COVID.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2295.965s">[Leming]</a>: So I don't have to look for a job right now because that check is going to last me another<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2301.493s">[Leming]</a>: another two weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2303.313s">[Leming]</a>: It's the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2304.153s">[Leming]</a>: The government gave us, the government gave the city of Medford some money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2308.554s">[Leming]</a>: It was a one-time thing from COVID and the proposal that we can plug ongoing costs from free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2315.175s">[Leming]</a>: All that would do is drain our reserves and we'd be back at square one in five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2323.137s">[Leming]</a>: If these overrides don't pass straight up, there will be layoffs in the school system and the roads will continue to be in disrepair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2330.538s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2792.681s">[Leming]</a>: So adding on to what Councilor Callahan said, partially this is due to the lingering costs of COVID, which resulted in both decreased funding going to the school system, partially that was just because you have fewer students going into public schools, and partially because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2812.608s">[Leming]</a>: there was a lot of activity in the healthcare system from COVID.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2815.793s">[Leming]</a>: So there is a sort of a, so the cost of health insurance, which we have to pay ended up rising.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2821.504s">[Leming]</a>: Those are some of the more short term reasons why we need this now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2824.809s">[Leming]</a>: Longer term,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2826.321s">[Leming]</a>: The way that Prop 2 NAP is designed is the total amount of money that the city can take in basically can't go up by more than 2.5% every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2836.11s">[Leming]</a>: While inflation has averaged for the past 44 years at 3.1% over time, that compounds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2842.436s">[Leming]</a>: So the budget today<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2844.137s">[Leming]</a>: is only a fraction, well, it's only about 78% as valuable today as it was back in 1980.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2852.464s">[Leming]</a>: So Prop 2.5 has this effect long-term on municipal budget where it squeezes resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2858.929s">[Leming]</a>: Most cities in Massachusetts have addressed this with the intended mechanism for overcoming this, which is periodic elections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2867.675s">[Leming]</a>: This is just the first time we're doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2869.677s">[Leming]</a>: That's part of the reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2871.318s">[Leming]</a>: the fact that we're so late to the game there is part of the reason that again we are 320 out of 351 cities in terms of our per capita budget and that is the reason why our schools could definitely be doing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2887.594s">[Leming]</a>: better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2888.174s">[Leming]</a>: That is the reason why you see so many potholes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2890.435s">[Leming]</a>: This is one step in addressing that situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2894.918s">[Leming]</a>: Once again, free cash, one time funding is not an actual longer term solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2902.141s">[Leming]</a>: If we just went with free cash, that would be drained in a couple of years, even shorter than the four to five year span I put, I said earlier, and then that's time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4482.151s">[Leming]</a>: I'm sorry, just to go back on that 3 to 5% thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4484.993s">[Leming]</a>: It's not 3 to 5% in totality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4486.713s">[Leming]</a>: It actually is recommended to generate 3 to 5% in free cash every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4491.036s">[Leming]</a>: So that is correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4492.717s">[Leming]</a>: I'm not sure where you're getting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4497.639s">[Leming]</a>: You can Google it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4498.64s">[Leming]</a>: You can look it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4499.32s">[Leming]</a>: I encourage you to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4501.161s">[Leming]</a>: But the point is, you generate three to 5% in free cash, and then it goes that can aggregate over time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4506.984s">[Leming]</a>: And then that can go towards one time capital expenditures, like for instance, two new fire trucks for the fire department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4513.427s">[Leming]</a>: That's how these big, that's how these sort of, I'd say, midsize expenses are accounted for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4520.003s">[Leming]</a>: Again, if I have a savings account and I'm living above my means, then eventually the savings account would run out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4531.491s">[Leming]</a>: So you're not supposed to plug the school budget every single year with free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4537.594s">[Leming]</a>: because it would run out eventually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4540.115s">[Leming]</a>: We did that with $1.75 million this past year with the understanding that we would then do an override to try to fix the problem in the long term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4549.658s">[Leming]</a>: Free cash is not a long-term solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4552.459s">[Leming]</a>: That keeps getting repeated, and I really just want to drive the point home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4556.04s">[Leming]</a>: It is not actually an answer to this problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4645.897s">[Leming]</a>: So in terms of how much free cash we actually have left, I don't have the numbers right in front of me, but I'm just remembering the expenditures off the top of my head.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4656.42s">[Leming]</a>: I believe after it was certified this past June, the number was 34 million, but I believe enough of that has been earmarked for various one-time expenditures at this point so that the actual number is, correct me if I'm wrong, would be about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4671.222s">[Leming]</a>: 10 to 11 million in reserves right now just because I see so much I can see someone shaking their head in the audience but I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4682.905s">[Leming]</a>: So again, this is ballpark numbers because we did allocate free cash first for the stabilization funds, which recently went to things like those light posts that were falling over, that were, you know, rusted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4698.65s">[Leming]</a>: They went to $3 million for the MSBA study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4703.732s">[Leming]</a>: It went to pay for HVAC systems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4707.833s">[Leming]</a>: It went to pay for, there was a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4713.5s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, there's a long list of items that were in some memos from a couple of months ago that I think some of my colleagues could help me out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5408.745s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Lemming, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5412.126s">[Leming]</a>: I'd just like to really emphasize that if you're interested in learning more about the shortfalls in the school, in the Medford Public Schools budget, then the videos and the presentations that were given during the budget season at the Medford School Committee meetings, I believe around June, would be where you want to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5432.612s">[Leming]</a>: So those are on YouTube.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5433.752s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5828.308s">[Leming]</a>: So for the size of the override, what I'll say is that we got, we went 44 years without an override, and this is the first time that we're asking the voters to do an override, which has become very commonplace in other communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5846.658s">[Leming]</a>: And so, yeah, if we, you know, there potentially is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5853.301s">[Leming]</a>: a debt exclusion in the future for the high school as a capital project, but just in terms of level expenses, the overrides are a mechanism to undo, to overcome the effects of inflation long-term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5869.773s">[Leming]</a>: So I will just point out that we've gone this long without an override, and this is the first time that we're asking for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5877.867s">[Leming]</a>: We've survived pretty long so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5881.669s">[Leming]</a>: And we're pretty late to the game, to be honest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5886.753s">[Leming]</a>: Will another override be needed in another 44 years?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5890.635s">[Leming]</a>: Maybe, because inflation will keep going up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5894.017s">[Leming]</a>: But right now, we know that we need this, or else, again, the roads will continue to be in the state that they're in, and we will have to have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5904.376s">[Leming]</a>: a lot of layoffs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5905.357s">[Leming]</a>: That's not a scare tactic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5906.457s">[Leming]</a>: That's just the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5907.798s">[Leming]</a>: It's just math.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5908.739s">[Leming]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7343.632s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7344.352s">[Leming]</a>: So I would like to point out that in asking for specifics for these things, there is a bit of a kind of a circular logic that goes in because if hypothetically we were to put forward to the voters the exact pay scale of each teacher in each line item, that's not really possible because union contracts haven't actually been negotiated, haven't been negotiated yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7366.819s">[Leming]</a>: So that would be premature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7371.861s">[Leming]</a>: No, no, no, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7376.284s">[Leming]</a>: And so, I mean, it goes for a lot of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7380.147s">[Leming]</a>: It goes for the development of the plans for a fire station as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7385.03s">[Leming]</a>: So you don't have to have the plans completely finalized and approved, but you can have a estimate for the full cost of the station from the people that are developing the plans beforehand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7397.218s">[Leming]</a>: Right now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7398.178s">[Leming]</a>: estimate is $30 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7400.48s">[Leming]</a>: And it goes, I mean, it goes for the salaries as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7404.282s">[Leming]</a>: So, you know, we are, we put in the ballot questions, the areas where it would go to, but we can't say it will go to 10 teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7413.529s">[Leming]</a>: It will go to 15 parents, et cetera, because those need to be negotiated after the fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7418.632s">[Leming]</a>: On the other hand, if, on the other hand, if we do<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7421.574s">[Leming]</a>: I've also heard people say, OK, how can you promise higher wages, for instance, if those contracts haven't been negotiated?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7428.961s">[Leming]</a>: So this becomes a bit of a chicken and egg problem when asking for specifics versus not being specific enough on these valid questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7436.549s">[Leming]</a>: I'd just like to make that general point, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8495.515s">[Leming]</a>: Well, just to make the point that if you have a, you know, we, this is a request to pay slightly more property taxes, but it also goes along with the general point of, yeah, $37 a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8509.626s">[Leming]</a>: That's, that is slightly more, you know, with the, to go along with the general point of you get what you pay for,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8519.887s">[Leming]</a>: Again, we are a very underfunded city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8524.112s">[Leming]</a>: And we would like that to not be the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8527.216s">[Leming]</a>: And this is a step in the right direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8530.96s">[Leming]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9071.544s">[Leming]</a>: I'm sorry, where is the woman who asked the question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9079.227s">[Leming]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9080.028s">[Leming]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9081.208s">[Leming]</a>: No, I just wanted to point out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9082.309s">[Leming]</a>: So there was, so I've seen this, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9085.566s">[Leming]</a>: error that people have been doing with the DLS calculator the past week or so, where they're taking the $7.5 million that comes from questions seven and eight combined, and then they're just adding that to the $30 million and then saying... I think she just added the $2 million for the estimated... Yeah, that is actually...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9600.659s">[Leming]</a>: So first, just to make the point that disagreeing doesn't mean it's a fear attack, it just means I disagree with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9607.391s">[Leming]</a>: Just want to put that out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9609.082s">[Leming]</a>: The actual answer to that is that the communities that haven't had to do Prop 2.5 overrides to keep a level budget are either the communities that have just much bigger budgets overall than we do, like Boston, or in cases like Cambridge, they invested in areas like Kendall Square years and years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9633.961s">[Leming]</a>: Medford could have invested in that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9638.504s">[Leming]</a>: kind of development a long time ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9640.045s">[Leming]</a>: We just never did that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9641.847s">[Leming]</a>: And smaller communities that don't really have the opportunity to do that sort of commercial development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9646.891s">[Leming]</a>: Some towns are basically just residential properties and not a whole lot of commercial activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9653.596s">[Leming]</a>: They have to do these sorts of overrides regularly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9656.258s">[Leming]</a>: So Medford kind of avoided this by just doing cuts and cuts and cuts until we became a very underfunded community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9663.879s">[Leming]</a>: And now that we're at this point, there's really not much of a choice except for either kicking the can down the road more, which doesn't solve the problem, or doing one of these overrides like Our Neighbors, or we could get a time machine and do a lot more commercial development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9682.142s">[Leming]</a>: But of course, that's not an option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9683.603s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10017.063s">[Leming]</a>: I mean, I think we've already gone over the free cash issue quite a bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10025.929s">[Leming]</a>: It wouldn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10027.69s">[Leming]</a>: That's the answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10029.412s">[Leming]</a>: We used $1.75 million in free cash to plug the budget with the understanding that we would have an override coming up on the ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10040.379s">[Leming]</a>: I think what my colleague is saying is that we should do that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10044.041s">[Leming]</a>: another year and then do an override the next year or so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10048.262s">[Leming]</a>: But it's, I'm honestly a bit confused why it keeps coming up as a solution to all of our problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10055.585s">[Leming]</a>: Cause it's not like you just can't use free cash year after year for salaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10061.486s">[Leming]</a>: That's not the way it works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10063.087s">[Leming]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11455.848s">[Leming]</a>: Let's move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11459.33s">[Leming]</a>: We still have a City Council meeting to go to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12478.72s">[Leming]</a>: Now, Councilor Collins said a lot of points that I was going to make, which is to get the bird's eye view.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12486.546s">[Leming]</a>: Most of this council is pretty, is fairly new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12489.508s">[Leming]</a>: About half of us are in our first term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12493.231s">[Leming]</a>: And so we are trying to lay the foundations for the further growth and development of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12500.336s">[Leming]</a>: The most important thing, the most important component of that is the zoning overhaul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12506.232s">[Leming]</a>: a couple of meetings ago, I brought up a linkage fee proposal which would essentially raise the fees that developers pay for the first time to the city for their developments for the first time in 30 years that passed this council six to one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12521.824s">[Leming]</a>: I think that you'll find that we are intensely focused on the financials so that we will have growth for the next 10 years, for the next 20 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12532.312s">[Leming]</a>: In general, this city,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12536.278s">[Leming]</a>: a lot of the political history of this city has been sort of attempting to kick the can down the road or just say, oh, or just come up with like vague ways to say, oh, we should all come together and find solutions, but not actually ever backing anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12551.79s">[Leming]</a>: This council is actually laying the foundations and passing actual ordinances and legislation so that we won't have to worry about that in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12563.379s">[Leming]</a>: So yes, we are building a foundation that should have been built a very long time ago, and these overrides are really meant to address more short-term concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12573.108s">[Leming]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13410.931s">[Leming]</a>: So speaking a bit more of a bird's eye view of this, I do wish that things were better between the fire union and the mayor and that that process had gone better for both parties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13426.218s">[Leming]</a>: And I am sorry at how that has evolved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13429.5s">[Leming]</a>: My view of this is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13433.078s">[Leming]</a>: even is that the debt exclusion is about funding and it's not, I don't see it as necessarily being tied to whatever plans come out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13443.166s">[Leming]</a>: That's just how I view it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13446.849s">[Leming]</a>: So that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14169.056s">[Leming]</a>: I'm going to try to give more of a personal perspective of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14175.081s">[Leming]</a>: It's a good question, one that hasn't been directly addressed in these chambers too much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14179.085s">[Leming]</a>: I think, honestly, what we're seeing here is a bit of a generational divide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14185.65s">[Leming]</a>: So I think that previous generations of politicians quite literally came from a different part of town.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14196.069s">[Leming]</a>: I've literally analyzed this myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14197.53s">[Leming]</a>: I put up a blog post about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14198.831s">[Leming]</a>: And so there's a lot of people in the city who are used to having this personal relationship with their elected officials, because they're literally the people that they grew up with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14209.037s">[Leming]</a>: But over time, the demographics of Medford have shifted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14214.96s">[Leming]</a>: You have a much younger generation of voters, a lot more people moving in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14220.324s">[Leming]</a>: And so there's a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14223.26s">[Leming]</a>: And so most, I mean, most of the city counselors these days live in just literally a completely different geographical part of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14231.411s">[Leming]</a>: And so I've spoken to, you know, there's been a lot of angry meetings and there is like some folks who've come up and said, you know, very<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14239.918s">[Leming]</a>: unpleasant things to me, who I've later had very good one-on-one conversations with, and they've said, well, Matt, people are scared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14248.006s">[Leming]</a>: And I do think that in some cases that is the case, because they feel like they don't really know, at a personal level, some of the folks here, just because we do come<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14264.611s">[Leming]</a>: we are like literally living in a different part of town.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14267.852s">[Leming]</a>: Um, so I think that, I think that these sorts of things will heal, um, will heal over time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14274.693s">[Leming]</a>: Um, I think it's a matter of, I'm trying to figure out like who, uh, that comes to these meetings is willing to have a nice one-on-one conversation, develop those relationships.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14284.515s">[Leming]</a>: Not everybody is, but some people are, so it will heal with time is my take on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=639.707s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=640.928s">[Leming]</a>: So, when I first in the time before, and I ran for council in the time that I was running one thing that I learned is that there are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=653.123s">[Leming]</a>: a lot of people in the city who hold politics above personal relationships.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=659.949s">[Leming]</a>: Because when I said that I'm running as a progressive, those are my ideals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=666.895s">[Leming]</a>: And then you end up making a decision that maybe some person doesn't like, you kind of notice that there's a lot of folks in the city who will turn on you after that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=677.685s">[Leming]</a>: And that's happened<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=679.787s">[Leming]</a>: to me quite a few times with relationships that I've had with various folks around the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=686.672s">[Leming]</a>: I've noticed that Larry was one of the few people who truly did not matter to him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=695.817s">[Leming]</a>: There's a few other people like that where you could tell it's just whatever happens politically, whatever happens in the chambers, it just doesn't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=708.223s">[Leming]</a>: matter to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=710.144s">[Leming]</a>: They'll always value their relationship.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=712.725s">[Leming]</a>: They'll always value who you are as a human being above all of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=716.986s">[Leming]</a>: They really know how to remain neutral and respect the person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=724.829s">[Leming]</a>: And so it made me respect and miss him a lot more, even though I haven't known him as long as some of my colleagues had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=738.51s">[Leming]</a>: gave him a phone call, gave him a phone call over the summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=742.153s">[Leming]</a>: And after he'd been hospitalized, talked for a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=745.796s">[Leming]</a>: Remember, I just asked him about the history of the, you know, Medford politics, because we're having some contentious meetings here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=754.824s">[Leming]</a>: And he said to me, Matt, it's always been that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=762.256s">[Leming]</a>: So this was a guy who, he'd been around the block a few times, and he knew that at the end of the day, it's the person that matters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=770.484s">[Leming]</a>: It's none of this, all of this is ephemeral.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=773.547s">[Leming]</a>: So I miss him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=787.85s">[Leming]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=796.773s">[Leming]</a>: Speaking of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=801.114s">[Leming]</a>: As we were saying, we lost Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=804.236s">[Leming]</a>: She walks in the door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=811.127s">[Leming]</a>: Would we withdraw the motion so that we can allow for more discussion from the colleagues who just arrived?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=819.43s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1568.07s">[Leming]</a>: This is just to add on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1570.091s">[Leming]</a>: I fully agree that the cost of these facilities needs to be determined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1576.115s">[Leming]</a>: Probably also the very basic question of which parks and what would be an ideal number to shoot for across the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1585.762s">[Leming]</a>: How many of these facilities do we want to build?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1755.871s">[Leming]</a>: It's just a question for Councillor saying what resident when you're putting this forward, what resident complaints were you specifically responding to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1768.002s">[Leming]</a>: Was it folks that were visiting certain parks who wanted this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1773.066s">[Leming]</a>: What was, could you just talk a little bit about the feedback you were getting that led to this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1902.332s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1904.406s">[Leming]</a>: On that, I would motion to request feedback on the cost, potential cost savings and need for these sanitary facilities in public spaces around Medford from Tim McGivern and Alicia Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1933.11s">[Leming]</a>: as well as their recommendation, as well as their long-term recommendations on this problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1943.555s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, I was trying to think of a way to word it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1946.636s">[Leming]</a>: But essentially, given the resources, the intent of it is given the resources the city has now, how much do they think that their resources should be prioritized to implementing this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2091.004s">[Leming]</a>: I'm just unsure how that would be implemented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2092.845s">[Leming]</a>: Would it be an email to all city staff and then request a general request for feedback?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2177.833s">[Leming]</a>: new wording of the motion could be, and feel free to feel free to jump in if any of my more experienced colleagues have recommendations to edit it, but a motion to request feedback from department heads on the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2196.235s">[Leming]</a>: idea of installing permanent sanitary facilities in public spaces, including our parks, with the invitation to have one-on-one meetings with council members if they feel the need to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2211.705s">[Leming]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=123.015s">[Leming]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=161.63s">[Leming]</a>: All right, Justin, you on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=165.191s">[Leming]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=168.172s">[Leming]</a>: Cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=170.993s">[Leming]</a>: Ready?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=172.593s">[Leming]</a>: Do I have to do a roll call?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=182.697s">[Leming]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=185.618s">[Leming]</a>: No, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=187.363s">[Leming]</a>: All right, welcome to the meeting of the Medford Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=194.585s">[Leming]</a>: This is the first meeting that I've been in where we are testing out our new AV system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=201.667s">[Leming]</a>: So you might notice some technical difficulties going on with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=207.588s">[Leming]</a>: I believe what you do, Councilor Callahan-Lazaro, is press the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=216.465s">[Leming]</a>: Yep, Kevin Harrington is kindly instructing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=235.694s">[Leming]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=237.154s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, if you want to, the way that this works is you put yourself in the queue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=243.675s">[Leming]</a>: And then when I put next on, that means that I can end up sort of choosing people in the order that they press their little mic button.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=250.617s">[Leming]</a>: So I could also try to make it so that we could all just talk at once, but I'm going to have to get used to these new controls here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=259.498s">[Leming]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=260.618s">[Leming]</a>: The first thing that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=263.599s">[Leming]</a>: We are going to go over this session is the draft of the Medford City Council newsletter for October 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=272.286s">[Leming]</a>: I ended up, I was the one who drafted this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=278.251s">[Leming]</a>: It essentially just goes over everything that we've covered in the past month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=286.018s">[Leming]</a>: I would like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=288.603s">[Leming]</a>: You know, I sent the meeting out, I sent the document out to all my colleagues prior to this, and just invited everybody to offer their comments as some folks are doing right now in this at the moment, like, even as we speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=310.643s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Sang, I would like to also draw your attention just to the governance committee, as well as Councilors Lazar and Callahan to the committees that you chair, just to be sure that the descriptions that I wrote for those are accurate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=325.43s">[Leming]</a>: So if you have any thoughts or questions or ways that you think things should be edited, feel free to let me know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=341.187s">[Leming]</a>: Let's see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=346.609s">[Leming]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=361.774s">[Leming]</a>: Kevin, it says that her mic is on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=364.555s">[Leming]</a>: Hold on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=366.715s">[Leming]</a>: Here, but it's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=457.296s">[Leming]</a>: We're going to, let's, I understand that we're just, I just want to do, finish editing the newsletter and then we will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=477.87s">[Leming]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=479.791s">[Leming]</a>: So, all right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=480.552s">[Leming]</a>: So if councillors, that's reasonable enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=484.214s">[Leming]</a>: If councillors would like to spend a little bit of time editing it while we go through Councillor Sang's presentation on the next agenda item, then feel free to do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=500.484s">[Leming]</a>: I understand that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=503.792s">[Leming]</a>: Due to some emails flying around, not everybody has been able to do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=507.615s">[Leming]</a>: But if Councilor Sang would like to offer a brief presentation on the state, on the Human Rights Commission, then as he wants to, then he can go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=524.908s">[Leming]</a>: Then feel free to take it away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=590.626s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Sang.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=592.507s">[Leming]</a>: So for the very brief update on the State of the Human Rights Commission, we will move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=603.711s">[Leming]</a>: Are there any other comments from Councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=607.653s">[Leming]</a>: Okay, we'll move on to public comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=611.574s">[Leming]</a>: I see Steve Schnapp's hand raised on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=615.075s">[Leming]</a>: I'm just gonna ask him to unmute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=633.456s">[Leming]</a>: No, no, go, go for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=635.038s">[Leming]</a>: Without that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=711.184s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=711.845s">[Leming]</a>: Is there any other public comment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=717.346s">[Leming]</a>: Anyone else who'd like to speak?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=719.067s">[Leming]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=724.709s">[Leming]</a>: Seeing none, do we have a motion on the floor regarding this paper?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=742.238s">[Leming]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=744.86s">[Leming]</a>: Motion by Councilor Lozaro to keep the paper in committee, seconded by Councilor Sang.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=752.686s">[Leming]</a>: Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=772.97s">[Leming]</a>: Yes, for an affirmative, none absent, the motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=780.932s">[Leming]</a>: Would also like to note for the AV folks that there might need to be a better system for roll call in the future as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=794.955s">[Leming]</a>: So it's just kind of because it's good<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=801.129s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, it's better to be able to do it quickly instead of have everybody queue up each and every time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=807.111s">[Leming]</a>: So there's kind of a note for the future with this new audio-visual system we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=812.893s">[Leming]</a>: But in any case, I'd like to thank everybody for attending for the brief update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=818.854s">[Leming]</a>: And I hope that we'll be able to have something public as soon as we can on the Human Rights Commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=828.51s">[Leming]</a>: Moving back to the newsletter draft, which we can hopefully hammer out and set a record for pretty fast committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=840.3s">[Leming]</a>: I'm just going to share that once again to Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=843.203s">[Leming]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=851.613s">[Leming]</a>: So it looks like we just have a couple of typos, which are entirely my fault.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=859.319s">[Leming]</a>: So I'm just going to go ahead and accept a few of these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=861.14s">[Leming]</a>: Let's see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=867.004s">[Leming]</a>: And if any counselor has anything in particular that they'd like to point out in the newsletter or discuss, then just feel free to raise your hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=875.63s">[Leming]</a>: The counselor is saying, I see that your hand is raised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=878.272s">[Leming]</a>: Is that from before?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=879.653s">[Leming]</a>: That was from before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=882.014s">[Leming]</a>: Okay, cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=926.1s">[Leming]</a>: The links I put there solely to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=930.882s">[Leming]</a>: The links I put there mainly to just help myself later when I go into latech and create it and format it myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=955.611s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=957.429s">[Leming]</a>: And I'm just going through this through and accepting Councilor Sang's edits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=965.813s">[Leming]</a>: It's clear that Harvard Law student is much better at editing texts than a very tired scientist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=977.519s">[Leming]</a>: Unequally tired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=980.981s">[Leming]</a>: A very tired Harvard Law student is clearly better with the English language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1005.965s">[Leming]</a>: All right, that looks... Wait, Councilor Sang, is this comment that I'm seeing here...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1039.295s">[Leming]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1054.094s">[Leming]</a>: Cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1058.575s">[Leming]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1059.216s">[Leming]</a>: And I understand that I was trying to remember that meeting following the four hours and 42 minute Q&A session, which of the resolutions from the October 15th meeting we tabled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1076.323s">[Leming]</a>: And I asked the clerk earlier, and he said that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1080.643s">[Leming]</a>: According to his memory, we did not table the commemoration of Sarah Bradley Fulton Day, but we did table the commemoration of the two DPW staff members who returned a lost wallet for the next regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1094.667s">[Leming]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1110.8s">[Leming]</a>: Um, at the commemorations and acknowledgement section, uh, we, I put the, I put the two, uh, commemorations from the October 15th meeting in there, but we tabled a couple of stuff really, really quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1124.506s">[Leming]</a>: And I was having trouble remembering exactly which ones we table and which ones we very quickly passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1129.628s">[Leming]</a>: So, um, I would, do you want me to run down and check?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1170.373s">[Leming]</a>: Can we just, how do we make these all just so that people can unmute themselves?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1173.996s">[Leming]</a>: How do we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1176.939s">[Leming]</a>: No, no, I mean, this is just a regular time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1199.898s">[Leming]</a>: So, in the, you know, in some of the earlier ones we might have accidentally left off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1206.403s">[Leming]</a>: a couple of them or not put all of them on there especially because the initial one was covering a four-month period and it was pretty lengthy as it was but um I think I think moving forward it's probably it would just be nice to show people um who and all was commemorated at these these different meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1227.978s">[Leming]</a>: Sorry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1236.952s">[Leming]</a>: When was that passed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1265.21s">[Leming]</a>: What date was Larry's passing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1269.073s">[Leming]</a>: Really?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1271.755s">[Leming]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1275.877s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1276.378s">[Leming]</a>: It's hard for me to find the records of the ones I can get the date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1288.786s">[Leming]</a>: Well, the date of the resolution would have been the 15th, but the date of his passing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1294.673s">[Leming]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1295.733s">[Leming]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1295.993s">[Leming]</a>: October 14.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1296.453s">[Leming]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1304.795s">[Leming]</a>: Does this seem like an appropriate addition?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1306.816s">[Leming]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1317.058s">[Leming]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1317.638s">[Leming]</a>: Do we have a motion on the floor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1324.4s">[Leming]</a>: Chairman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1327.281s">[Leming]</a>: Was that a second councilor saying?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1347.806s">[Leming]</a>: I'm just going through and looking at it and accepting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1416.51s">[Leming]</a>: public vote in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1419.092s">[Leming]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1452.582s">[Leming]</a>: Motion by Councilor Callahan to approve and release.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1457.343s">[Leming]</a>: Do we have a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1459.184s">[Leming]</a>: Seconded by Councilor Lozaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1461.825s">[Leming]</a>: Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, would you please call the roll?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1481.408s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1482.349s">[Leming]</a>: Four in the affirmative, one absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1484.43s">[Leming]</a>: The motion passes and we have another newsletter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1490.553s">[Leming]</a>: Do we have any other motions on the floor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1495.316s">[Leming]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1495.976s">[Leming]</a>: Seconded by?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1498.017s">[Leming]</a>: On the motion to adjourn by Councilor Lazaro, seconded by Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1502.4s">[Leming]</a>: Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, would you please call the roll?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1521.514s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1521.934s">[Leming]</a>: For the affirmative one absent, the motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1524.616s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you everybody and have a wonderful evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4487.355s">[Leming]</a>: Just to add to that, so this actually came up at an event at a small house party where we were talking about these measures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4498.262s">[Leming]</a>: Somebody asked me, well, if you're proposing to put $500,000 towards the GDW for road repairs, I live on a private road, how would that affect me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4508.769s">[Leming]</a>: I had no idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4509.93s">[Leming]</a>: So I ended up emailing Tim McGibbon, CC, the fellow who asked me, and what Tim said was that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4517.715s">[Leming]</a>: there is no, so just by the fact, by the nature of it being private, there's no legal obligation for him to actively repair these roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4528.639s">[Leming]</a>: But he said that they, if, when they have capacity, they will do it anyway, just to keep the city nice, and putting a permanent road repair crew into being going will just give them,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4543.585s">[Leming]</a>: more capacity to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4545.526s">[Leming]</a>: So that was his perspective on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4549.128s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5257.263s">[Leming]</a>: That's correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5258.124s">[Leming]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5258.264s">[Leming]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3411.547s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3412.128s">[Leming]</a>: Just like to really quickly request that when, at the meeting when TDM is discussed specifically, I would appreciate some forewarning on that because I think it would be appropriate to invite the Lower Mystic TMA to that meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3427.601s">[Leming]</a>: They have been asking about it, so I'm not sure if there will be a specific meeting about that in itself or if it will just come up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3437.529s">[Leming]</a>: as a topic in future meetings, but in any case, I'm forewarning that you'll appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3477.388s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Lueb, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3482.092s">[Leming]</a>: Yes, I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3483.453s">[Leming]</a>: There are some folks from there that have been speaking with me, and they even previously met with City staff, but I think it would be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3498.084s">[Leming]</a>: wise to invite them to the planning meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3501.065s">[Leming]</a>: I mean, I can't go to them because of, obviously because of open meeting law considerations, but I know that just on some emails, their contact information is available and they previously met with me and Laurel Siegel, but that was a while ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3520.012s">[Leming]</a>: So just having them be more included in the workflow, I think would be a good idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4443.443s">[Leming]</a>: There's no more public comment or input from staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4447.365s">[Leming]</a>: I wanted to make a motion to refer to a regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4461.532s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4604.464s">[Leming]</a>: Motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4606.065s">[Leming]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1371.109s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1373.611s">[Leming]</a>: At this committee meeting, we heard a brief update from Councilor Sang on the progress of the Human Rights Commission updates, and we drafted a newsletter which was subsequently released, and that's what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1391.446s">[Leming]</a>: I have a motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1449.576s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you, Council President Bares.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1450.777s">[Leming]</a>: I have a motion to suspend the rules and take public participation out of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2319.193s">[Leming]</a>: This is just a very brief comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2321.314s">[Leming]</a>: So I do definitely hear what Marianne is saying about during any construction phase, it's likely that parking would be unavailable during that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2328.877s">[Leming]</a>: But the RFP, just to really highlight this, the RFP does call for the construction of a parking garage in any developments that are created so long term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2342.144s">[Leming]</a>: ideally going by what the RFP says, this wouldn't affect parking availability in the area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2349.874s">[Leming]</a>: So that's the idea, but I just wanted to, again, I'm hearing what Marianne is saying about the temporary unavailability during construction, but I did want to highlight that for folks in the room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2358.404s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4430.53s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4432.791s">[Leming]</a>: So this is pretty much a cut and dry resolution which would adopt the two parts of the HERO Act that City Councils explicitly need to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4447.257s">[Leming]</a>: I've talked to the Veteran Services Director and the assessor<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4451.559s">[Leming]</a>: about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4452.161s">[Leming]</a>: So clause 22.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4458.815s">[Leming]</a>: that would allow for the city to go up to the full amount of exemptions for veterans, although we already do that in other parts of general laws, chapter 59.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4475.399s">[Leming]</a>: So it wouldn't necessarily add to that, but Ted tells me there's no harm in adopting it anyway, just for future purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4482.201s">[Leming]</a>: The real effect of that would be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4484.382s">[Leming]</a>: The real important part here is clause 22 I, which would basically increase the amount of folks tax exemptions on a yearly basis according to increases in the consumer price index.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4497.727s">[Leming]</a>: So it's another mechanism to make these kind of dollar amount exemptions automatic without a city council or the state having to come in and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4510.211s">[Leming]</a>: do that explicitly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4511.252s">[Leming]</a>: So that's one of the new things that the HERO Act allows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4515.877s">[Leming]</a>: So I yeah, it's a you know, it's a fairly straightforward adoption of provisions of state law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4526.086s">[Leming]</a>: And I would motion to send this to legal for review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4535.84s">[Leming]</a>: I talked it over with head he recommended to send it to legal for review first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4663.666s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4664.207s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, so this is, there's already, I mean, Ted's already seen the text of this and he approved everything, but I could add onto that motion just a request from the assessor for a memo, an additional memo to outline his approval for it in the public record if my colleagues think that that is appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4731.957s">[Leming]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4732.937s">[Leming]</a>: Sounds good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4733.378s">[Leming]</a>: So moved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1589.201s">[Leming]</a>: I'd also like to point out that people are confused about this because an organization that Councilor Scarpelli is in the leadership, I've sent people out an email saying that this was what was written in the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1598.951s">[Leming]</a>: So if you send an email.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1619.0s">[Leming]</a>: I mean, you can't send an email out saying that this is what it's about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1635.769s">[Leming]</a>: You're causing confusion and saying there's confusion in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5240.038s">[Leming]</a>: Yes, thank you, Council President Bares.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5242.479s">[Leming]</a>: The only amendment to this that council advised was to remove the up to and up to 100% in the very last paragraph of the resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5255.425s">[Leming]</a>: but otherwise both council and the assessor thought that this was perfectly acceptable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5262.651s">[Leming]</a>: So I would motion to amend this to remove the two words up to in the very last paragraph and pass it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5740.162s">[Leming]</a>: No, I just wanted to clarify that in our correspondence that I had with Paul Raihee, he said that he did select the contractor already that will be doing this work, the same company that did historic renovations for Faneuil Hall in Boston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5755.932s">[Leming]</a>: So I don't know the name of that company specifically, but I had a back and forth with him about with him and some members of the CPA about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5764.257s">[Leming]</a>: So that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5765.828s">[Leming]</a>: already is selected as my okay so he did that already Yeah, okay.<br><br>
