    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=14.0s">[Leming]</a>: Present<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2343.294s">[Leming]</a>: This is more just a curiosity question, but with the health insurance, is there any possibility or is it feasible at all to switch health insurance providers or is that just a non-starter?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4298.474s">[Leming]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=6037.057s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=6039.138s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=16.026s">[Leming]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=937.705s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=939.186s">[Leming]</a>: So the resident services and public engagement subcommittee consisted of myself, Councilor Callahan and Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=946.073s">[Leming]</a>: Met, we basically just discussed procedures for these listening sessions and divided the different groups that each subcommittee member would schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=960.808s">[Leming]</a>: listening sessions with over the next year or so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=965.554s">[Leming]</a>: And then we, that was pretty much it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=969.499s">[Leming]</a>: It was a pretty informal meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=994.209s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=995.01s">[Leming]</a>: We drafted and approved the second newsletter of the Medford City Council, which is now available on the City Council web page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1004.058s">[Leming]</a>: If anybody is interested in checking out the final version, we also met to discuss the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1012.526s">[Leming]</a>: proposed ordinance change to allow the veteran services director to offer an incentive to landlords that are willing to rent out to qualified veterans and address the veterans homelessness issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1026.577s">[Leming]</a>: There was a motion to send that to legal for review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1032.961s">[Leming]</a>: And that was, those were the items that were discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1035.523s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1444.375s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1606.41s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3376.145s">[Leming]</a>: I'd also like to add that in addition to my colleagues' efforts on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3381.188s">[Leming]</a>: So I talked to legal about what options city council has in helping the tenants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3388.933s">[Leming]</a>: And honestly, as we've been hinting, there isn't really a whole lot that we can do given the current tools that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3396.497s">[Leming]</a>: There's a lot that we could have done if different choices were made 30 years ago, if the city had decided to plant that tree 30 years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3405.502s">[Leming]</a>: We could have put up the money to do that, but we can't right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3410.205s">[Leming]</a>: But right now, this city council is asking, trying to ask the state to give us the tools to prevent that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3417.89s">[Leming]</a>: And not only are we seeing these real estate management companies not respond to their own tenants, not sit down to negotiate, but we're also seeing them actively fight tooth and nail to prevent cities from having those tools in the first place because they're making so much money from this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3436.563s">[Leming]</a>: What they're spending their time doing, and I'm sure that a lot of people in this room have received those mailers, is put out information, mass text robocalls that are scaring average homeowners, average residents into thinking that these initiatives that this city council is pursuing is going to hurt them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3455.381s">[Leming]</a>: It's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3456.162s">[Leming]</a>: It is going to prevent your neighbors from being driven out of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3460.171s">[Leming]</a>: Okay? That's what we're seeing, is a very small number of bad actors put out propaganda to prevent the city from having even the minimum amount of tools necessary to prevent this from happening in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3472.82s">[Leming]</a>: So I know that, you know, people come here and they don't like to see it when their neighbors get kicked out because right now these problems have a face to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3484.487s">[Leming]</a>: They have the face of your neighbor saying that we're going to have to leave because a big company is telling us to leave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3491.043s">[Leming]</a>: And then it feels bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3491.945s">[Leming]</a>: But when people say, Oh, you know, somebody should have done something about this 30 years ago, somebody should have done something about this before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3499.777s">[Leming]</a>: That's because everytime anybody's tried to do anything about it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3504.517s">[Leming]</a>: big money interest will come in and prevent it from happening through these sorts of opposition campaigns, which we're seeing in Medford right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3513.282s">[Leming]</a>: So I'd like to point that out, that that's an important piece of context.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3518.065s">[Leming]</a>: The Charles Gate Realty Group is not giving silence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3521.327s">[Leming]</a>: What they're doing is giving large donations to state senators, state representatives, telling them to nix these initiatives at the state level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3530.513s">[Leming]</a>: That's what's happening right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3979.517s">[Leming]</a>: I'd also like to just, the CPA seems to come up a lot here, but something like $2.4 million is already going to affordable housing initiatives to rebuild Walkling Court.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4004.674s">[Leming]</a>: Please do not interrupt. Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Scarpelli,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4007.696s">[Leming]</a>: I sat on the CPA prior to being elected to this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4012.998s">[Leming]</a>: Now, affordable housing projects that involve building do come along less frequently than open space and historic preservation projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4021.002s">[Leming]</a>: And so typically a larger portion of funding needs to be dedicated to those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4025.744s">[Leming]</a>: One project, because the CPA has not really been around all that long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4030.546s">[Leming]</a>: Now, funding,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4032.607s">[Leming]</a>: a mediator, I suppose, is not a solution to these problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4040.574s">[Leming]</a>: They're trying... Councilor Scarpelli, they're trying to find mediation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4043.377s">[Leming]</a>: They've said that they're trying to find mediation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4045.358s">[Leming]</a>: So putting more money towards somebody else that's also trying to find mediation is not a long-term sustainable solution to this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4055.387s">[Leming]</a>: to this problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4056.588s">[Leming]</a>: Now, I agree with what Vice President Collins just said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4060.03s">[Leming]</a>: This has gotten off topic, but I hear so much misinformation about the CPA being thrown around these chambers that I did feel like addressing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4067.596s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4648.0s">[Leming]</a>: I just stopped the video<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=5803.19s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6194.34s">[Leming]</a>: I would motion to table this until the next regular meeting, because I would, like, that wasn't in the text that I received at all, and I would like to actually read over what Councilor Scarpelli just said in order to study it and process it a little bit more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6261.32s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6881.018s">[Leming]</a>: Motion to recess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6898.504s">[Leming]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=6909.532s">[Leming]</a>: President Bears, I'd like to, because the amendment made it very clear this is a financial paper, I'd like to invoke Rule 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6085.503s">[Leming]</a>: Motion to move the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6747.241s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you, and I'd like to thank everybody for waiting so long across two meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6751.986s">[Leming]</a>: It's unfortunate that we did have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6753.928s">[Leming]</a>: Can everybody hear me okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6760.409s">[Leming]</a>: OK, so what I'm going to talk about is what we're actually voting on tonight, why there is a housing need in Medford, Massachusetts, and how this helps that, and why this particular policy is unlikely to affect seniors, average homeowners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6777.64s">[Leming]</a>: It's really more targeted at high-end real estate deals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6782.163s">[Leming]</a>: Hey, excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6784.644s">[Leming]</a>: Excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6786.971s">[Leming]</a>: Excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6798.114s">[Leming]</a>: So at the state level, Governor Healy and many of our neighboring communities have proposed different forms of a real estate transfer fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6807.182s">[Leming]</a>: This is because Massachusetts is in a housing crisis right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6811.446s">[Leming]</a>: Medford in particular needs to build 671 more units in order to even meet a minimum 10% affordable housing requirement mandated by the state of Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6820.894s">[Leming]</a>: Each of those units cost between $500,000 and $600,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6825.718s">[Leming]</a>: to fund and to build and it was only last year that we even instituted an affordable housing trust which would be able to dedicate revenue towards putting towards addressing that problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6842.193s">[Leming]</a>: I have right here a letter<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6844.315s">[Leming]</a>: from 21 residents of 208 Main Street, in which they say that they are being evicted right now because a major real estate company bought up their apartment complexes and told them they have to get up by next month if Medford had been serious about funding, any form of affordable housing 10 years ago, they, this would not be the case for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6867.332s">[Leming]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6869.033s">[Leming]</a>: Currently we have the Community Preservation Act funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6872.357s">[Leming]</a>: Before I was elected, I sat on the Community Preservation Act, or sorry, on the Community Preservation Committee, and we were able to dedicate maybe $800,000 a year to fund<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6887.877s">[Leming]</a>: to fund affordable housing developments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6891.418s">[Leming]</a>: We ended up dedicating about $2.4 million to walk link or but we only pay 2% of the price tag for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6899.582s">[Leming]</a>: So we need more revenue streams in order to put any sort in order to build up any sort of corpus of money that can be dedicated to affordable housing residents are being priced out of the city, and we need to more actively engage that now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6915.908s">[Leming]</a>: What is what is being voted on tonight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6918.812s">[Leming]</a>: What is being voted on tonight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6920.214s">[Leming]</a>: Many residents, I believe, came here tonight under the belief that we were voting to pass a 2% tax on all real estate transactions in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6931.608s">[Leming]</a>: That is most definitely not the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6934.091s">[Leming]</a>: That is not the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6936.975s">[Leming]</a>: Because what this is, is a resolution to discuss the transfer fee to develop it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6945.387s">[Leming]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6946.148s">[Leming]</a>: And there's different forms that these transfer fees can take at the state level what Governor Healy is pushing for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6952.256s">[Leming]</a>: is is a transfer fee that wouldn't tax any price below $1 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6957.401s">[Leming]</a>: So if you sold $1 million property, you'd pay zero if you sold a $1.2 million property $4,000 split equally between the buyer and the seller.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6968.011s">[Leming]</a>: That is one example of a transfer fee policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6970.574s">[Leming]</a>: neighboring communities have submitted transfer fee policies that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6973.797s">[Leming]</a>: exclude seniors transactions between family members and owner occupied residences completely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6979.842s">[Leming]</a>: So in other words, under these different examples of a transfer fee policy, if you lived in a home and you were selling it to somebody else who also intended to live in that home,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6990.151s">[Leming]</a>: it wouldn't it would not apply to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6992.454s">[Leming]</a>: Okay, this is really meant to address the situation like the one being experienced by the residents of 208 Main Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7000.564s">[Leming]</a>: Now, the trouble that we've gone through with this is the fact that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7005.089s">[Leming]</a>: This was originally on the February 20 agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7008.714s">[Leming]</a>: And it was because there was a lot going on in that meeting it was tabled until today so that allowed three weeks for it to sit on the city council agenda, and a lot of misinformation<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7020.211s">[Leming]</a>: was, I believe, spread around the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7022.674s">[Leming]</a>: It's an unfortunate timing issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7024.776s">[Leming]</a>: Something this important should not be sitting on an agenda without any discussion for this long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7029.4s">[Leming]</a>: And so I know what my personal ideas about what a real estate transfer-free policy should look like, but because of a meeting law, I don't know what my colleagues as of yet think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7039.13s">[Leming]</a>: We haven't been able to discuss it amongst ourselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7042.634s">[Leming]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7043.315s">[Leming]</a>: Now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7048.237s">[Leming]</a>: The point is that even if the vote on this is successful tonight, we're not passing real estate transfer fee policy, we are passing a resolution to discuss and develop it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7058.344s">[Leming]</a>: And this will then contain a number of exclusions, etc, etc.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7062.947s">[Leming]</a>: Now, even if we were to develop one, we were to pass it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7067.29s">[Leming]</a>: It's and so on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7068.391s">[Leming]</a>: This is a home rule petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7069.671s">[Leming]</a>: It does not mean that Medford would then have a real estate transfer fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7073.494s">[Leming]</a>: What it means is that we would ask the state to pass it and the state may or may not choose to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7079.277s">[Leming]</a>: And if the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7081.819s">[Leming]</a>: No, listen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7086.121s">[Leming]</a>: Okay, they may or may not choose to pass it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7088.763s">[Leming]</a>: If they do, we still don't have a real estate transfer fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7091.586s">[Leming]</a>: We get the option to then develop our own.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7095.169s">[Leming]</a>: Now 18 other communities have requested a real estate transfer fee from the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7101.494s">[Leming]</a>: None of them have even been debated yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7104.056s">[Leming]</a>: The version that Governor Healey is trying to push in the Affordable Homes Act may or may not give us the option by default.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7113.624s">[Leming]</a>: So that is what is happening tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7117.727s">[Leming]</a>: We're not discussing anything like rent control or any of the other home rule petitions that people have brought up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7124.331s">[Leming]</a>: This is a resolution to find out, do we want a real estate transfer fee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7129.415s">[Leming]</a>: What exclusions would be in it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7131.576s">[Leming]</a>: Because at the end of the day, Medford really needs to be serious about addressing the affordable housing situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7138.761s">[Leming]</a>: People come to us a lot and they talk about the roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7141.283s">[Leming]</a>: They talk about improving the schools and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7143.884s">[Leming]</a>: and a lot of other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7145.985s">[Leming]</a>: The fact of the matter is that Medford increasingly is pricing out the working class, and those are the people that repair our roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7152.208s">[Leming]</a>: Those are people that improve our infrastructure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7154.349s">[Leming]</a>: They can't afford to live here anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7155.83s">[Leming]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7157.991s">[Leming]</a>: So that's what this is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7160.632s">[Leming]</a>: Now, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7162.753s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7565.687s">[Leming]</a>: They're currently interviewing people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9864.67s">[Leming]</a>: I mean, I wouldn't say it's impossible that the state would approve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9867.473s">[Leming]</a>: But even having having the home rule petitions like this come to the state house from multiple communities does really emphasize to, um, the state government that this is something that communities really need help on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9881.105s">[Leming]</a>: I just like to touch on to, um, two other points because I was conversing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9890.473s">[Leming]</a>: this is a particular item that I think that I think has received a lot of outsized attention compared to a lot of other things City Council is doing when it comes to affording the to funding the affordable housing to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9899.758s">[Leming]</a>: We're not definitely not putting all of our eggs in this basket.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9902.68s">[Leming]</a>: Later on in the agenda, I have three resolutions to update linkage fees, which haven't been updated since the 1990s.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9911.285s">[Leming]</a>: There's other things that are going through committee right now related to shortening the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9918.809s">[Leming]</a>: that there is a window that developers have to sit on property, which would therefore shorten the overall development time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9926.073s">[Leming]</a>: It's just that this particular resolution, I think, just due to some unfortunate, um, timing and obviously poor optics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9935.459s">[Leming]</a>: What was the three weeks in between meetings has just received, um, a lot of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11390.134s">[Leming]</a>: Any answers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11392.195s">[Leming]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11394.056s">[Leming]</a>: The basis for a lot of these programs is often money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11397.637s">[Leming]</a>: So Somerville has a community land trust.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11399.678s">[Leming]</a>: It's just that they've had an affordable housing trust since like the 90s.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11402.52s">[Leming]</a>: So it's been accumulating money for years so that they could actually do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11406.321s">[Leming]</a>: I hear a lot of,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11407.822s">[Leming]</a>: programs like that that could address the housing crisis, the basis of it is always money, which we again we literally just instituted an affordable housing trust last year and this is one of the revenue streams we're investigating for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=15048.978s">[Leming]</a>: Go to Councilor Leming then we'll go back to public participation Councilor Leming know I was just saying that we should move on to the next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17091.541s">[Leming]</a>: It was just a minor point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17093.082s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17094.583s">[Leming]</a>: But again, we haven't actually discussed the details of what this would look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17098.786s">[Leming]</a>: I'd have to go to the committee to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17100.347s">[Leming]</a>: But in other transfer fee proposals, transfers between family members where usually no cash is actually exchanged or it's pretty standard to exclude those from consideration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17114.057s">[Leming]</a>: you know, and if you gave a, you know, million dollar home to your child, like they're not giving you a million dollars for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17123.444s">[Leming]</a>: So there's no cash sort of tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17126.166s">[Leming]</a>: So that would, I just want to put that out there that typically in these proposals, those are exempt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17131.95s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17876.392s">[Leming]</a>: I'm glad someone reads them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19191.614s">[Leming]</a>: What a, what an evening it's been.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19194.338s">[Leming]</a>: So, so I just would like to address some of the just sort of reiterate what I said earlier in my initial comments which is to say that the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19209.153s">[Leming]</a>: The way that this got broken to the public was really not ideal, and I do wanna recognize that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19219.321s">[Leming]</a>: Normally something like this would be put on the agenda, discussed at a council meeting, and then a lot more public information would come out then, and then something a little bit more solid would be developed in committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19233.826s">[Leming]</a>: What happened was our February 20 meeting, we ended up, you know, addressing the fire for the firefighter issues and of course that just ended up pushing the whole meeting to past midnight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19248.094s">[Leming]</a>: So this was tabled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19250.235s">[Leming]</a>: And then we also had the election on March 5 so that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19254.917s">[Leming]</a>: was another delay and basically just it meant that there was three weeks where again, this was on the agenda with zero details to the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19266.928s">[Leming]</a>: And Councilors here were also a little bit hamstrung in terms of what we could promise the details would look like because again, we hadn't actually discussed it yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19274.676s">[Leming]</a>: I was trying to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19278.339s">[Leming]</a>: I was trying to write on my website about what different RETF policies could look like, what the process was, and just generally try to clarify things there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19288.745s">[Leming]</a>: But again, it was difficult because I can't promise anything because the proposal itself hasn't been developed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19294.968s">[Leming]</a>: I do wanna, I would like to recognize that and acknowledge that the way that this was broken to the public, especially in this instance, wasn't ideal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19306.55s">[Leming]</a>: And we do have a lot of improving to do in that space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19310.271s">[Leming]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19746.013s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, what's that piece of paper?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19747.394s">[Leming]</a>: I've been curious all evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19773.786s">[Leming]</a>: I gotcha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19923.004s">[Leming]</a>: This is only like the first resolution on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=20341.628s">[Leming]</a>: I am so sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=21132.705s">[Leming]</a>: Okay, so basically this is, this is sort of supposed to be three resolutions but I think it was, it was now I'm just getting emotion table until the next meeting table to the meeting on March 19 Councilor living seconded by Councilor gala.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yp_xdtxEMNg&t=12.5s">[Leming]</a>: Present<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=61.371s">[Leming]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=315.097s">[Leming]</a>: I can't see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=354.67s">[Leming]</a>: Can you share your screen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=397.464s">[Leming]</a>: Okay, what part would you want me to scroll to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=431.568s">[Leming]</a>: She's on Zoom right now, so she can share the screen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1482.552s">[Leming]</a>: I'll second that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1485.373s">[Leming]</a>: Nothing in particular to add.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1688.729s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you, Chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1689.909s">[Leming]</a>: So my thoughts on the feral stray cat issue is, one, I'm concerned that somebody could use that as an excuse to just keep putting food out for wildlife, and it would be very hard to disprove any sort of, to disprove intention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1715.214s">[Leming]</a>: there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1715.614s">[Leming]</a>: That's the first thought that comes to my mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1719.717s">[Leming]</a>: The second is, how often do people who engage in spay-capture-neuter-release programs end up catching stray cats with food versus other means?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1741.609s">[Leming]</a>: Oftentimes,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1743.584s">[Leming]</a>: get a stray cat, like some of them are friendly, you could pick them up off the ground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1748.788s">[Leming]</a>: I would be interested to hear staff opinion on some of these issues, but those are just the problems with that that are coming to mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1762.357s">[Leming]</a>: My mom does the capture and release quite a bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1766.52s">[Leming]</a>: So a lot of this is just coming from what I'm thinking about she does,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MzfT6g6xeyw&t=1886.569s">[Leming]</a>: Yes, I did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=43.0s">[Leming]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=157.059s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=293.299s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=398.281s">[Leming]</a>: I found them in order and motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2061.145s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6781.919s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you, council president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6784.561s">[Leming]</a>: It is so much easier to criticize action than it is inaction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6791.546s">[Leming]</a>: And unfortunately for decades, this city<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6799.005s">[Leming]</a>: has really not done a whole lot to address the structural underfunding that has led up to this fiscal cliff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6810.549s">[Leming]</a>: I want to be extremely clear that if this override doesn't pass, as the mayor said, we will be here next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6818.953s">[Leming]</a>: We will have to lay a lot of people off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6823.138s">[Leming]</a>: The roads will continue to be in the state they're in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6826.101s">[Leming]</a>: And as my colleague said, they will continue to get worse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6830.647s">[Leming]</a>: The fire department will not get its headquarters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6833.851s">[Leming]</a>: We need this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6837.222s">[Leming]</a>: as Council Vice President Collins said, this is the most important vote that is coming before this Council tonight, that has come before this Council so far this term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6848.677s">[Leming]</a>: Now, I don't know what it means to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6853.464s">[Leming]</a>: do an override right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6854.605s">[Leming]</a>: I'm sure that they've had, that they've done it differently in other cities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6858.048s">[Leming]</a>: And I know that my colleagues on council, my colleagues on school committee and the mayor may have slightly different views on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6865.535s">[Leming]</a>: They announced the financial task force months ago via press release.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6869.358s">[Leming]</a>: It was never a secret committee and they had to work out a compromise to bring what we're seeing today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6877.671s">[Leming]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6878.631s">[Leming]</a>: And I'm not going to sit here and criticize people who are trying to address the issues that people have been talking about in this city for decades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6891.294s">[Leming]</a>: And I'm sure that a lot of people will come around and say, you know, we need more development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6897.776s">[Leming]</a>: We need to work, do more with less, whatever that means.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6905.158s">[Leming]</a>: We need to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6906.997s">[Leming]</a>: I mean, we're already down to the bone, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6910.698s">[Leming]</a>: I've been to the school committee budget meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6914.32s">[Leming]</a>: They've already stripped the school budget down as far as it can possibly go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6919.401s">[Leming]</a>: If this doesn't pass, we don't know what we'll do next year, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6923.663s">[Leming]</a>: So I just wanna make the point that this is, I think, any kind of action, any kind of action<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6933.348s">[Leming]</a>: any kind of choice that the voters have, that we can give the voters is praiseworthy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6939.192s">[Leming]</a>: I commend my colleagues for doing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6942.634s">[Leming]</a>: This is going to be historic in this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6945.516s">[Leming]</a>: This is what we need right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6949.739s">[Leming]</a>: And big picture, I just want to really drive that point home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6954.902s">[Leming]</a>: You know, unity is not doing what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6961.021s">[Leming]</a>: the loudest people in the room say we should do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6964.366s">[Leming]</a>: Unity is fixing the problems that the vast majority of the city have told us about, even if our solutions aren't perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6976.226s">[Leming]</a>: So thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6977.207s">[Leming]</a>: I heard a, I heard a groan in the audience when council, when the council president listed the large amount of speakers that, uh, that still had to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6987.474s">[Leming]</a>: And so I think everybody wants to get to public comment period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6990.396s">[Leming]</a>: So I'm going to leave it at that and thank all those who've spoken so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6994.759s">[Leming]</a>: And I look forward to hearing what folks have to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7742.773s">[Leming]</a>: No, this is just a quick one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7743.935s">[Leming]</a>: So Councilor Scarpelli brought up twice or several times the fact that his<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7749.929s">[Leming]</a>: previous paper was a rule 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7753.05s">[Leming]</a>: I just want to be clear about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7755.291s">[Leming]</a>: So first off, if anybody would like to look at the May 28th meeting, the city council meetings are now on YouTube.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7762.173s">[Leming]</a>: So you're free to look up how that particular debate went.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7766.054s">[Leming]</a>: But I rule 21'ed it because it was a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7770.916s">[Leming]</a>: vague resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7772.037s">[Leming]</a>: It was just to generally discuss options for the school budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7778.142s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli had previously submitted a similar resolution several meetings before, and he was asked by the council president to make his resolutions more specific so that people would know what he specifically intended to bring to the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7792.934s">[Leming]</a>: The last one was a resolution to discuss subcommittee processes, and it ended up in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7800.425s">[Leming]</a>: Um, it ended up veering into a letter that my colleagues had signed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7805.248s">[Leming]</a>: Um, so it just generally got off topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7808.65s">[Leming]</a>: So I just wanted to clarify that I wanted the resolutions of themselves to be specific so that we will know what is being talked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7818.536s">[Leming]</a>: We could have talked about that resolution today, but my colleague decided to withdraw it, um, at the beginning of the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7826.06s">[Leming]</a>: So we never did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14593.293s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=14745.696s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=540.274s">[Leming]</a>: Just like to say that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=544.115s">[Leming]</a>: When I was a member of the CPA, Tom Lincoln, he was one of our frequent customers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=552.56s">[Leming]</a>: He just brought in application after application to repair the Brooks Estate, and he's the driving force behind the upkeep of that property today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=562.985s">[Leming]</a>: This is just a case of an<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=566.707s">[Leming]</a>: ordinary citizen of Medford, seeing something that they wanted preserved, seeing a project that they could really get behind, and putting their time and energy into it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=577.116s">[Leming]</a>: And it's really paid off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=578.777s">[Leming]</a>: I look forward to telling Mr. Lincoln how much I admire him when he does come to the next city council meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=589.005s">[Leming]</a>: Congratulations, Mr. Lincoln.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=591.127s">[Leming]</a>: You're a great citizen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=592.548s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1155.006s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1156.479s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1157.16s">[Leming]</a>: Just keep mine short and I'll say Sylvia, we love you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1160.605s">[Leming]</a>: We'll miss you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1161.646s">[Leming]</a>: We'll miss your humor and your presence in the clerk's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1168.055s">[Leming]</a>: I don't think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1169.844s">[Leming]</a>: The clerks often get enough credit for all the work that they do behind the scenes and all the institutional knowledge that they bring to City Council and City Hall and the help either just with purely procedural stuff or just with moral support when we've had a rough evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1191.318s">[Leming]</a>: And Sylvia will be dearly missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1194.42s">[Leming]</a>: That being said, enjoy retirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1197.242s">[Leming]</a>: Have a good time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1198.323s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=1670.081s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=5939.871s">[Leming]</a>: I'd just like to say, it looks like you've assembled a real dream team here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=5945.857s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you very much for... No, I'm serious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=5951.502s">[Leming]</a>: I looked through the descriptions of everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=5958.462s">[Leming]</a>: I know that I spent a lot of time just focusing on, you know, trying to find good people for the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=5964.406s">[Leming]</a>: It looks like everybody here is far, far more qualified than<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=5971.414s">[Leming]</a>: when it comes to anything related to affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=5975.156s">[Leming]</a>: And thank you so much for your efforts in assembling these six people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=5981.658s">[Leming]</a>: I know that they'll do fantastic work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=5987.1s">[Leming]</a>: I look forward to recommendations from these folks when it comes to both any affordable housing policy ideas and ways to get money into the trust fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=5998.904s">[Leming]</a>: So just,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=5999.824s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you for your efforts and that's all I got.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6002.795s">[Leming]</a>: Vice President Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6270.642s">[Leming]</a>: Just wanted to say, I remember back when I was getting my appointment to the CPA,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6281.525s">[Leming]</a>: I remember I waited in this room until about one, one o'clock in the morning, watching a very good meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6291.111s">[Leming]</a>: It was a great meeting, but also just say that when I saw at his name on the, on the agenda, I was kind of thinking like, you know, I really don't want to have somebody else go through that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6303.539s">[Leming]</a>: That's, that's not, not always the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6307.441s">[Leming]</a>: most pleasant thing to go through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6308.681s">[Leming]</a>: So I was kind of behind the scenes asking folks to do that, to move this paper out of order just so that she didn't also have to wait till one in the morning to get appointed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6321.206s">[Leming]</a>: But just wanted to say right over your resume, I think it's wonderful to have a social worker with heights of the community on the CPA and I know you'll do good work there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6334.331s">[Leming]</a>: So yeah, that's all I got.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11254.315s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11254.556s">[Leming]</a>: I would just like to thank you for figures two and three, which very clearly show the amount that has been matched by the state every year since 2018.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11263.88s">[Leming]</a>: Um, as well as figure three, which very clearly shows that historically they're 29% of CPA funds have gone towards affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11274.165s">[Leming]</a>: I would recommend modestly that maybe the color coding is could be updated because we get these in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11283.09s">[Leming]</a>: It looks beautiful in the PDF.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11284.491s">[Leming]</a>: It looks absolutely wonderful, very clear in the online PDF.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11288.453s">[Leming]</a>: But I will say that just in the printed version, it's not quite clear that the state matching has been very consistent year to year, in spite of what has often been said in these chambers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11300.62s">[Leming]</a>: So thank you very much for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12449.913s">[Leming]</a>: So just two questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12451.995s">[Leming]</a>: So to clarify, if somebody wanted to build an ADU on their house and they lived in a historic district, then you would require that the ADU be built with materials similar to the one that are used to currently construct the house?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12465.764s">[Leming]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12466.165s">[Leming]</a>: The other one, and I've kind of been curious about this ever since I first saw this map a couple of months ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12473.42s">[Leming]</a>: Could you talk about the houses between, I believe it's 84 and 102, or are they just like newer buildings?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12498.186s">[Leming]</a>: Oh, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12499.106s">[Leming]</a>: Use your arrow keys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12500.027s">[Leming]</a>: You can go back with the arrow key.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13970.862s">[Leming]</a>: I just have one question for the members of the Historic District Commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13974.844s">[Leming]</a>: When you were deciding which district to choose for those, what other areas were you sort of considering?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13983.49s">[Leming]</a>: And can you just delve a little bit more into the specific rationale for choosing South Street?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14543.299s">[Leming]</a>: I feel like we need a bit more of an extensive presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15171.179s">[Leming]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15841.854s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15842.674s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15845.66s">[Leming]</a>: I don't want to meditate too much on this, but I would like to clarify because I said that I talked to the administration about free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15854.486s">[Leming]</a>: And I want to clarify what I mean when I say that I talked to the administration is I Googled Bob Dickinson, the finance director's phone number, left him a voicemail, and then he got back to me and we talked for like, you know, half an hour about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15869.736s">[Leming]</a>: free cash, because when I saw, you know, $9 million, I was kind of like, what's going on here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15874.598s">[Leming]</a>: And so then, you know, the finance director has been working in this area for years, and me, who, as an elected official, doesn't suddenly mean that I know everything about finance, I talked to him about it, I asked my questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15887.563s">[Leming]</a>: And he explained, you know, what the situation was, it's not a simple issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15893.306s">[Leming]</a>: Cities are kind of on a one year delay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15895.146s">[Leming]</a>: So in many ways, we're dealing now with what was budgeted last year, and we are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15899.008s">[Leming]</a>: going to be in our budget, and we're trying to predict what the budget will be next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15902.191s">[Leming]</a>: They always come up with conservative estimates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15903.812s">[Leming]</a>: Part of the free cash comes from the fact that the police department couldn't hire 10 police officers, so that's $800,000 extra in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15912.119s">[Leming]</a>: Obviously, if we want to be able to fill those positions, that is not revenue that we can expect to come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15918.525s">[Leming]</a>: next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15919.326s">[Leming]</a>: Part of it just came from poor, inaccurate estimations in previous years of what healthcare costs would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15925.473s">[Leming]</a>: Those things are always hard to predict.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15929.939s">[Leming]</a>: And part of this is the fact that we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15933.263s">[Leming]</a>: implement, you know, we have these one time very big studies to try to invest in our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15938.811s">[Leming]</a>: Obviously, we're debating many of those tonight costs like 15 million bucks to replace the HVAC systems for the middle school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15946.381s">[Leming]</a>: So we need to, we need to spend, we need to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15950.106s">[Leming]</a>: fix that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15951.628s">[Leming]</a>: And we can't just say, Oh, here's $9 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15953.85s">[Leming]</a>: Well, we should use that on salaries, continuing costs, which will just sink, which will just like eat up all of that money in a couple of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15964.34s">[Leming]</a>: So, you know, in order to appropriately finance the city, it's not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15969.645s">[Leming]</a>: It's not an easy thing to explain, but at the end of the day, free cash goes to one-time costs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15974.287s">[Leming]</a>: You cannot count on it as an ongoing source of revenue, especially to handle salaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15979.61s">[Leming]</a>: The other thing to note is that being an elected official doesn't mean that people will suddenly make an effort to call me<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15992.717s">[Leming]</a>: to give me information and include me in on things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15995.398s">[Leming]</a>: It's my job to go out and seek that information and try to educate myself on things that happen, you know, just because, you know, being elected basically means that I get to sit in the seat and talk for however long I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16012.745s">[Leming]</a>: I'm allowed to, and vote on ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16018.489s">[Leming]</a>: If I was not involved in the financial task force in order to figure out how things work, any city councilor can do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16026.495s">[Leming]</a>: You call up somebody, you seek out that information, you build up those relationships, and if you choose not to do that, then you won't be included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16034.181s">[Leming]</a>: That's just how it works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16035.682s">[Leming]</a>: So I'd just like to clarify that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16038.444s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19005.427s">[Leming]</a>: Part of this that gives me pause is the fact that Medford, the mayor's chair of the school committee and so I mean I know that that's two different positions but by two legally different positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19018.554s">[Leming]</a>: I, yeah, I, I know but the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19024.183s">[Leming]</a>: it could change if the charter changes, but effectively the person who is occupying both the position as mayor and the position as head of the school committee in Medford are the same person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19039.517s">[Leming]</a>: And so the chair of the school committee did get a raise already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19047.964s">[Leming]</a>: And so that's,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19050.649s">[Leming]</a>: That's I'd say that I'd say that that's the part that that's that's the one part of this that does give me that does give me some pause the logic of having not received an increase in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19062.985s">[Leming]</a>: 10 years, that does make sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19066.329s">[Leming]</a>: But the person who is essentially doing the job that they have done that whole time has received a raise that we approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19078.762s">[Leming]</a>: So that's the only part of this that I'm questioning right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=205.217s">[Leming]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=208.319s">[Leming]</a>: Go ahead and get started here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=212.301s">[Leming]</a>: Meeting of the Medford City Council Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=216.584s">[Leming]</a>: Madam Clerk, will you please call the roll?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=229.693s">[Leming]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=242.724s">[Leming]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=245.645s">[Leming]</a>: Four present, one absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=248.445s">[Leming]</a>: Meeting is called to order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=251.186s">[Leming]</a>: First item that we're just, that we're going to discuss is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=255.348s">[Leming]</a>: 24-354, the resolution to publish a City Council newsletter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=260.09s">[Leming]</a>: A draft of the newsletter was forwarded to everybody in the agenda packet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=268.254s">[Leming]</a>: I also, earlier today, forwarded a copy, an updated<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=276.792s">[Leming]</a>: Copy of the newsletter with some suggestions to reflect events from the meeting last night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=284.058s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Callahan, you have a?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=291.184s">[Leming]</a>: Okay, yep, yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=292.084s">[Leming]</a>: I'm just going to share my screen really quickly, one moment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=298.39s">[Leming]</a>: Okey dokey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=310.616s">[Leming]</a>: So this newsletter, as per the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=318.684s">[Leming]</a>: As per the schedule that we voted on earlier, was drafted by Council President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=326.029s">[Leming]</a>: I submitted, I forwarded the link to everybody here, made a couple of suggestions, and then Councilor Bears earlier today also edited those to provide his own suggestions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=339.798s">[Leming]</a>: So if folks have anything that they'd like to add to the newsletter,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=346.883s">[Leming]</a>: feel free.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=347.344s">[Leming]</a>: I'll start with Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=391.233s">[Leming]</a>: I'm trying to find exactly where.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=393.354s">[Leming]</a>: I just, you said elected with voted, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=409.554s">[Leming]</a>: Well, yeah, okay, so it looks like that was our in the latest updates from Council President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=417.901s">[Leming]</a>: It looks like he already struck that out and replaced it with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=487.666s">[Leming]</a>: And are you seeing the changes that I made?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=490.028s">[Leming]</a>: Is this fine with you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=494.512s">[Leming]</a>: Cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=494.832s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=496.914s">[Leming]</a>: Anyone else have any suggestions for the current draft of the newsletter?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=501.838s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=532.283s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, with the final PDF, why it would end up being formatted, I'm not 100% sure about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=545.713s">[Leming]</a>: But I do agree, this generally does make it more readable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=551.229s">[Leming]</a>: This is helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=587.095s">[Leming]</a>: What date was that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=588.077s">[Leming]</a>: OK, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=623.826s">[Leming]</a>: And I do remember what exactly the date was that we met with the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=677.927s">[Leming]</a>: It could be a good idea to just briefly summarize what was discussed or just state that we did it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=701.32s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=701.68s">[Leming]</a>: I always write things in a very boring way, so let me know if-<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=705.922s">[Leming]</a>: like these two are, you know, sufficiently descriptive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=731.539s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, I was actually, and and I were kind of talking about how to present how to present that so I was, I mean, we like I did take notes from them, I was kind of thinking that maybe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=746.756s">[Leming]</a>: some kind of a quarterly report on it, but we were sort of thinking like, okay, you know, do residents see these listening sessions as being semi-confidential?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=756.901s">[Leming]</a>: Like, do they not want notes of what they talked about to be public record?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=760.763s">[Leming]</a>: So I think that those things would need to be discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=764.304s">[Leming]</a>: It would definitely be a good agenda item to bring up formally for the next resident services meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=770.747s">[Leming]</a>: I'm not sure if we would have time or be able to discuss it extensively<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=775.612s">[Leming]</a>: this particular meeting because it's not on the agenda, but maybe we could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=807.241s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Calderon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=883.242s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, no, I mean this, it is it is definitely something and I was also kind of thinking like that this would actually come up in the next agenda item because some of the stuff that we did here at the listening sessions would be relevant to the city guide that we're talking about, but I do agree that having it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=900.876s">[Leming]</a>: be discussed and sort of like the ideas like sort of codified and shared with the rest of the council is definitely gets to the spirit of those listening sessions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=914.402s">[Leming]</a>: To the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=916.289s">[Leming]</a>: newsletter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=917.449s">[Leming]</a>: Is there any other, and again, I apologize for some of the last minute updates, but the goal with these is to summarize the most recent events leading up to the current meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=930.474s">[Leming]</a>: Is there any other feedback that individual, that Councilors have about the current draft of the newsletter that you'd like to see?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=954.156s">[Leming]</a>: Really, oh, oh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=955.196s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, that's why we've been kind of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=956.797s">[Leming]</a>: Oh, okay, okay, I did not, sorry, I didn't know that, okay, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=964.761s">[Leming]</a>: Sorry, I was so to be clear about the process for doing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=969.326s">[Leming]</a>: I have Google documents that I share with the individual Councilors who need to who are drafting that current one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=978.415s">[Leming]</a>: I did not know that people who just view these things don't actually see the current edits Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1003.947s">[Leming]</a>: Wait, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1012.671s">[Leming]</a>: Suffering from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1017.39s">[Leming]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1020.473s">[Leming]</a>: And I'll also just kind of scroll through this and very slowly to give everybody, I will fix, I will address this issue the next time so that, I'm just gonna start from the top, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1037.126s">[Leming]</a>: And just, again, apologies that I didn't know that it was invisible to people who just had view access to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1046.124s">[Leming]</a>: So, sort of summarizing the updates, Council President Bears has added the resolutions commemorating individuals at the last meeting, Sylvia Janis, Don Alasky, as well as Tom Lincoln, and the passing of former Medford Police Department Detective Lauren Kane.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1067.581s">[Leming]</a>: So we added those to commemorations and acknowledgements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1071.36s">[Leming]</a>: There was the acknowledgement of the Stop the Stigma campaign from a June 11th meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1077.568s">[Leming]</a>: I added in...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1079.224s">[Leming]</a>: The appointments from the June 25th meeting to the Affordable Housing Trust, the Community Preservation Committee, and the free cash allocation to the study for the new Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1093.529s">[Leming]</a>: Council President Bears has added details about the stabilization funds that we also allocated free cash to right here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1106.283s">[Leming]</a>: So, you know, just kind of detailing what happened later on last night in the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1116.007s">[Leming]</a>: And we approved the new South Street historic district ordinance for its first reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1125.231s">[Leming]</a>: Again, just summarizing what happened yesterday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1130.413s">[Leming]</a>: Some edits to the Public Works and Facilities Committee, which recognize the fact that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1137.683s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Lazzaro's resolution to host a discussion of MassDOT plans for the Medford Square Main Street intersection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1146.39s">[Leming]</a>: Planning and Permitting Committee, the zoning related recommendations of both Medford's comprehensive climate plan and how they can best be incorporated into the zoning update project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1157.438s">[Leming]</a>: And at the May 28th regular meeting, first round of zoning updates from the zoning update project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1166.581s">[Leming]</a>: June 12th committee meetings, zoning up the project, council's priorities, policies and plan recommendations implement, and a draft timeline of what elements of the project should be started first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1180.351s">[Leming]</a>: Then, the licensing of the methadone clinic that we referred to committee yesterday, as well as the planning, the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1195.143s">[Leming]</a>: zoning update projects, timeline, and maps from the planning and permitting committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1200.124s">[Leming]</a>: Those, yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1225.077s">[Leming]</a>: features.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1225.677s">[Leming]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1228.698s">[Leming]</a>: 25th point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1230.019s">[Leming]</a>: Okay, so that's about all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1232.2s">[Leming]</a>: Does do any Councilors have any suggestions for further edits to this draft?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1237.622s">[Leming]</a>: And once again, my apologies for the fact that most most people here couldn't see the updates until just now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1255.017s">[Leming]</a>: Move.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1256.018s">[Leming]</a>: We have a motion on the floor on the motion by Councilor Tseng seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1263.828s">[Leming]</a>: Madam Clerk, will you please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1278.277s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1280.519s">[Leming]</a>: 4 in the affirmative, 1 absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1283.662s">[Leming]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1285.463s">[Leming]</a>: Moving on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1286.224s">[Leming]</a>: 24-370 offered by Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1292.91s">[Leming]</a>: Resolution to create a residence guide to City Council's procedures and processes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1302.844s">[Leming]</a>: be it resolved that the Resident Services Public Engagement Committee create and publish a short guide in English and commonly spoken non-English languages to the City Council for residents to understand the City Council's procedures and processes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1316.397s">[Leming]</a>: I imagine this could just be a general discussion of our ideas of what this should contain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1321.221s">[Leming]</a>: Are there any comments on the floor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1325.305s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1463.843s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1466.465s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1589.471s">[Leming]</a>: So to summarize what I've heard, people generally like the idea of having a short one page for people to go through, but with the possibility of having supplementary documents that explain in more detail what the different rules and processes are, the having something just right at the top for people who've literally never been to city council meetings before, and just like very quick,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1618.592s">[Leming]</a>: like quick and dirty sort of points like, you know, when we take a vote, why there's not necessarily public participation there, as well as basic info about what the city council is in charge of and what falls under purview of other departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1640.279s">[Leming]</a>: In terms of format, I mean, I, I think it would be a good idea to have a one pager and like you see that little plastic thing right there where they have agendas out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1650.447s">[Leming]</a>: So just have something like that sitting out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1652.609s">[Leming]</a>: So it would be a good idea since this will be printed to have everything in black and white.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1657.273s">[Leming]</a>: So try to not like, and this is just my initial take, try not like indulge too much in like super colorful graphics, but just kind of keep like a very<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1665.748s">[Leming]</a>: basic presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1667.089s">[Leming]</a>: The important thing would be to have it done in multiple languages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1674.035s">[Leming]</a>: Not that we don't have to have graphics or anything, but just make it so that it looks reasonable when you print it off on a laser printer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1681.721s">[Leming]</a>: That's the other piece of feedback I have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1684.543s">[Leming]</a>: But I do agree that a nice one pager for people who come in here have never attended a meeting before and can just kind of like take that as something to hold would be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1693.863s">[Leming]</a>: very, would be a very nice thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1719.525s">[Leming]</a>: Leading up to this meeting, I actually was thinking that having a nice, colorful graphics-based thing would be a really cool product to show people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1727.172s">[Leming]</a>: But I'm also thinking about practicality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1730.154s">[Leming]</a>: When people come to a city council meeting, it's often in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1733.557s">[Leming]</a>: And I've heard a lot of people say, this is my first city council meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1736.88s">[Leming]</a>: I have no idea what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1738.902s">[Leming]</a>: And when we get these agenda packets,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1743.926s">[Leming]</a>: very often, and this is something that I even mentioned last night, the PDFs are sort of like very nice looking, very presentable, very colorful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1754.672s">[Leming]</a>: But when they're printed, and again, this is just like a super practical issue, it just doesn't translate well into black and white.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1762.076s">[Leming]</a>: And that will be the reality of residents that are actually holding this guide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1766.898s">[Leming]</a>: So I think simplicity is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1818.146s">[Leming]</a>: There's a movie that I saw a clip of one time as well, where it discussed the process of designing a new type of tank within the Pentagon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1830.214s">[Leming]</a>: And throughout the design process, different generals kept on giving their different pieces of input to the design of this thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1837.559s">[Leming]</a>: And the end product was something that had been completely designed by committee and was like, like totally impractical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1845.885s">[Leming]</a>: So I do think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1848.446s">[Leming]</a>: there is that element of that in making this as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1865.609s">[Leming]</a>: My point in saying that is that we are giving these suggestions and I have my own opinions on this, but you know, you know, you're the, you're the artist, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1879.051s">[Leming]</a>: You know, I think it's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1890.195s">[Leming]</a>: That is true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1890.776s">[Leming]</a>: We're discussing what's essentially an artistic project and we don't have the one artist on city council on this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1896.098s">[Leming]</a>: So there, I could see some issues with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1902.898s">[Leming]</a>: But no, that is to say we are making these suggestions, but it is important to filter through what is the most essential information for someone who has no idea what's going on, try to put that front and center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1915.324s">[Leming]</a>: The goal of this is that if somebody's entering these chambers,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1919.215s">[Leming]</a>: They don't know anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1922.738s">[Leming]</a>: They can read this piece of paper and get the 411 and oftentimes having too much information in one place could end up not being beneficial for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1935.37s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2011.626s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2014.588s">[Leming]</a>: Is there a color printer in this building?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2094.641s">[Leming]</a>: So I do, with Anna's suggestion,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2099.956s">[Leming]</a>: I am inclined to think so having, starting out with like a city council guide that looks clean, smooth, one pager would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2107.823s">[Leming]</a>: And then probably expanding to having something out front for that, you know, if we have like a nice city council one, we could also then do a general city hall one, which may be, okay, this is your first time in city hall, if you are a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2124.716s">[Leming]</a>: small business owner, go to this department on this floor, you can talk to this person and something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2131.262s">[Leming]</a>: But I, so there should be room to be able to scale it to other departments, but the initial model, just to keep the project simple, I feel like, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2147.264s">[Leming]</a>: don't, you know, we just started out by knowing what our scope is and just getting the first guide right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2154.23s">[Leming]</a>: And then after that, after that, expanding to that, that's my opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2269.711s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2271.832s">[Leming]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2273.271s">[Leming]</a>: Personally, with the survey, I think having a draft first, I think it would be more effective to have a draft and then put that out and ask for feedback on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2285.299s">[Leming]</a>: This is just kind of my initial thoughts on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2288.822s">[Leming]</a>: And then say, is this helpful to you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2290.723s">[Leming]</a>: Please give us feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2291.704s">[Leming]</a>: And then update it from there just so that people sort of have an idea of what you're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2297.947s">[Leming]</a>: That's just my thinking on that though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2300.269s">[Leming]</a>: So it would, again, you're the artist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2303.612s">[Leming]</a>: So don't let me, I'm not gonna tell Van Gogh what shade of yellow to use in the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2380.07s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Callaghan, tell us your thoughts right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2397.3s">[Leming]</a>: Everybody in this packed room is waiting for your thoughts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2405.666s">[Leming]</a>: Sorry, I was too busy making jokes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2408.708s">[Leming]</a>: On the best way to get feedback for the guide from residents, the discussion was... No, that's cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2465.691s">[Leming]</a>: I feel like if we're kind of looking at, I don't think that there would be much of an issue with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2472.597s">[Leming]</a>: you as an individual, as you're coming up with like an initial draft for this, posting this to one of your accounts just to get some feedback from folks and then bringing it to the body, which, and I'm mainly saying that just because that possibly would be a way to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2499.75s">[Leming]</a>: speed up the process and not have to like, you know, vote a vote, a draft of something out of a meeting and then get approval from the general body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2510.433s">[Leming]</a>: So I'm just trying to think of ways to kind of simplify the process of drafting a one pager here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2559.653s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2561.795s">[Leming]</a>: In terms of future directions, we did receive a, I mean, just because we said we were going to talk about this on the last agenda item, we did receive some feedback from some folks that are listening sessions who are saying that, you know, they go into city hall, they don't know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2583.803s">[Leming]</a>: like where to go from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2586.065s">[Leming]</a>: So I know that we're talking about solely a city council, one pager guide for residents, but scaling, like moving forward, it would be good to have, it would be good to, you know, at least start thinking about, you know, if somebody literally enters the building and they wanna talk to someone about getting a license, then having something right there for them to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2611.827s">[Leming]</a>: look at maybe having a greeter if that's a thing that City Hall has capacity for like I don't know the equivalent of a receptionist just right in the middle of City Hall would be a nice nice thing to have as soon as we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2631.641s">[Leming]</a>: get the funding for something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2633.062s">[Leming]</a>: But anyway, those are just some informal notes from our listening sessions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2646.084s">[Leming]</a>: Is there any further discussion on this agenda item?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2718.828s">[Leming]</a>: Yep, on the one pager.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2723.308s">[Leming]</a>: It's very, very controversial motion Councilor Tseng, do we have a, do we have a second on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2733.031s">[Leming]</a>: We have two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2734.851s">[Leming]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2745.075s">[Leming]</a>: Well, before we vote, do we have any public participation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2750.576s">[Leming]</a>: Anybody interested in public participation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2755.657s">[Leming]</a>: Okay, seeing none in the chambers and none on Zoom, we'll go ahead and call the vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2764.003s">[Leming]</a>: Roll call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2767.605s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2773.189s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2776.071s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2778.233s">[Leming]</a>: Four present, wait, four in favor, one absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2782.916s">[Leming]</a>: The motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2786.611s">[Leming]</a>: Motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2788.352s">[Leming]</a>: On the motion to adjourn, seconded by Councilor, was that a second, Councilor Callahan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2796.476s">[Leming]</a>: Madam Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2799.978s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2804.36s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2807.141s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2808.101s">[Leming]</a>: Four present, four affirmative, one absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2811.463s">[Leming]</a>: The motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2812.323s">[Leming]</a>: Meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=303.079s">[Leming]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9013.209s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you, Council President Sell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9015.638s">[Leming]</a>: Like my colleagues, I don't really like to hear a lot of the conspiratorial narratives, but I have a purely technical question about this that I hope that perhaps Councilor Scarpelli or somebody else could address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9029.728s">[Leming]</a>: If this information is already out there, I'd just like to know, are there any particular<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9037.759s">[Leming]</a>: papers or types of information that could be received with this resolution that could not be addressed with a simpler FOIA request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9050.824s">[Leming]</a>: Sorry, can you repeat that, a what request?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9053.144s">[Leming]</a>: FOIA, Freedom of Information Act request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9055.265s">[Leming]</a>: So my question is, could somebody simply submit a Freedom of Information Act request to the mayor<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9063.939s">[Leming]</a>: to the city to get the information requested in this resolution?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9068.161s">[Leming]</a>: Or is the resolution asking for information that could not be gotten through a Freedom of Information Act request?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9076.864s">[Leming]</a>: It's just a technical question that... I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9131.991s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9136.555s">[Leming]</a>: No, I just, I am just...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9140.981s">[Leming]</a>: I guess my point was first, I just wanted to know purely technically if there is any extra information that could be gotten from the council resolution that could not be obtained from a FOIA request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9153.328s">[Leming]</a>: And also just submitting a simple FOIA request on your own and then publishing the results of that when it was received, which would effectively get a lot of information out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9165.776s">[Leming]</a>: It could be just as an effective means<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9168.698s">[Leming]</a>: transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9171.079s">[Leming]</a>: Obviously, that wouldn't be the case if the answer to the first question was yes, there are certain documents that can be received.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9177.161s">[Leming]</a>: But that was that was what I was asking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=10185.385s">[Leming]</a>: Oh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=10918.606s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you, Council President Harris, for putting this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=10922.128s">[Leming]</a>: So I will be supporting the resolution, though one thing about it that I would like to point out is that there are sort of two...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=10936.545s">[Leming]</a>: The advocacy for putting this particular one on this particular question on the ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=10942.207s">[Leming]</a>: There were two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=10945.528s">[Leming]</a>: There were two sort of groups of advocates that were trying to get it through one of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=10952.902s">[Leming]</a>: One group was basically trying to make it so that anybody could grow these sorts of medicines for personal use and it would be less regulated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=10965.024s">[Leming]</a>: The other, which ended up being the question that we're seeing on the ballot with the sort of regulatory body is very similar to what is currently seen in Oregon, whereby you have a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=10982.193s">[Leming]</a>: body, an unelected commission that essentially does allow for people to use these medicines, but it generally puts a very high price on them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=10997.278s">[Leming]</a>: So it turns it into a for-profit, it turns it into a for-profit industry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=11003.56s">[Leming]</a>: So I will be supporting it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=11006.721s">[Leming]</a>: I think that any<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=11010.924s">[Leming]</a>: Any progress is good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=11014.287s">[Leming]</a>: Although I will be pointing out that it is slightly different from the same resolution that this body supported several months ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=11025.034s">[Leming]</a>: So thank you once again for your efforts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=11560.561s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=11889.693s">[Leming]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UuhcxZvksfg&t=655.584s">[Leming]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3665.755s">[Leming]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3886.723s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you, Council President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3889.625s">[Leming]</a>: So this is the result of a lot of discussions that I've been having with the Office of Community Development as we try to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3902.655s">[Leming]</a>: update the linkage program, the capital improvements program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3906.978s">[Leming]</a>: So this is essentially when developers come in to the city, they need to pay fees into certain buckets, which will help to improve the city as a whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3919.547s">[Leming]</a>: What we're trying to do with this program is first to update the original amounts that were proposed in 1990 when this was established.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3926.612s">[Leming]</a>: and we're also trying to add a fifth bucket in addition to the ones already mentioned in the letter for affordable housing to provide a more constant source of revenue to the affordable housing trust.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3938.659s">[Leming]</a>: We previously discussed changes to the ordinance at earlier meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3943.962s">[Leming]</a>: The issue is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3945.083s">[Leming]</a>: some of the changes that we're proposing after legal review, it turns out you would need to go back to the state to actually update those in a couple of ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3955.091s">[Leming]</a>: So in order to actually do these updates every<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3962.256s">[Leming]</a>: three years as is required by that ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3966.138s">[Leming]</a>: One study to do that could cost as much as $150,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3968.7s">[Leming]</a>: And so doing that every three years is too cost prohibitive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3973.702s">[Leming]</a>: Just performing the nexus study to establish a new bucket entirely for the affordable housing trust would probably cost about $80,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3981.667s">[Leming]</a>: The planning department has been going around trying to find consultants who are willing to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3988.31s">[Leming]</a>: Medford has a bit of a unique linkage program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3991.972s">[Leming]</a>: you know, they are having trouble finding a consultant for a reasonable price that can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3997.135s">[Leming]</a>: So what this would do first is it would just extend that to save the city a little bit of money because the full linkage program really wouldn't update that much within a three year period that you would actually need to do that study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4010.422s">[Leming]</a>: 10 years is a more reasonable timeframe to do these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4014.884s">[Leming]</a>: We've gone 34 years without doing one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4018.166s">[Leming]</a>: So I think getting away from that three year mark is reasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4022.547s">[Leming]</a>: And the second, which is very important, is literally just copied and pasted from a similar program that Watertown did in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4031.372s">[Leming]</a>: 2022, where instead of just having these linkage prices set and just consistently get undervalued by inflation at the same time, there will be automatic updates from year to year so that the city is not losing money over time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4045.643s">[Leming]</a>: And, you know, the less that we do, if we happen to have, you know, staff or boards who just<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4053.291s">[Leming]</a>: don't do what they're supposed to do and perform these studies every few years, we would just be losing money over time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4060.217s">[Leming]</a>: So again, it's a fairly simple update, but it does need to go to the state for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4066.923s">[Leming]</a>: So I would motion to approve this home rule petition and send it to the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4240.811s">[Leming]</a>: The linkage funds are for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4242.332s">[Leming]</a>: No, the linkage funds don't go to the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4244.133s">[Leming]</a>: It listed in the letter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4246.095s">[Leming]</a>: So, okay, so this is- Water, sewer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4252.426s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, so it's the police department, parks and rec, roads and traffic, water and sewers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4262.273s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, the authorizing legislation kind of gave a list of buckets that it could potentially go into, and affordable housing was one of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4269.419s">[Leming]</a>: But when they actually implemented it in 1990, they only chose those four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4354.52s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, this would just allow for, this would just allow those automatic inflation based updates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4361.167s">[Leming]</a>: And so it's a very specific, it's a very specific price index that's stated in the proposed change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4369.436s">[Leming]</a>: And this was already done over in Watertown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4372.419s">[Leming]</a>: So it is becoming standardized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4374.401s">[Leming]</a>: neighboring cities, it would also save the city money by expanding the requirement to actually do these studies from three to 10 years, because these studies are pretty cost intensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5797.787s">[Leming]</a>: So moved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6056.584s">[Leming]</a>: So when determining whether or not something will get through the state house, oftentimes you're reading the tea leaves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6063.691s">[Leming]</a>: But in this case, it was solely because they had already approved similar language with that same price index for the city of Watertown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6071.76s">[Leming]</a>: So they<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6074.122s">[Leming]</a>: the state legislature would want consistency going on there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6077.626s">[Leming]</a>: There wouldn't really be much of a reason for the city of Watertown to go for one price index and then Medford to just arbitrarily choose another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6086.257s">[Leming]</a>: So that's the justification behind that particular choice right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6094.847s">[Leming]</a>: In terms of the Affordable Housing Trust, as Council President Bears said, that is independent of any votes that took place tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6101.41s">[Leming]</a>: This was solely, the vote here was solely to ask the state to extend the period between these very expensive studies from three years to 10 years to save the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6113.334s">[Leming]</a>: a little bit of money, and also to allow for automatic adjustments to be applied for these, because right now, I think that when they instituted this, they assumed that the cities would just do these studies every three years, and Medford in practice just never did that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6127.016s">[Leming]</a>: We're supposed to, we never did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6129.437s">[Leming]</a>: So this just allows a mechanism to prevent that, those fees from being eaten up by inflation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6135.678s">[Leming]</a>: Right now they're worth less than half of what they were in 1990.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6142.359s">[Leming]</a>: The affordable housing trust fund, sorry, the affordable housing trust linkage program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6148.101s">[Leming]</a>: So that is, there is currently a draft that essentially establishes a fifth bucket in addition to the four that currently exist to go into the affordable housing trust.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6158.365s">[Leming]</a>: The affordable housing trust was already created by this council in the previous term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6163.487s">[Leming]</a>: And the state, the language of the state ordinance also allows for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6170.63s">[Leming]</a>: also allows for affordable housing to be one of those buckets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6173.812s">[Leming]</a>: So essentially all the ordinance would do is create a chain there that puts money into the bucket.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6184.698s">[Leming]</a>: The thing is that in order to do that, you do need another completely new study, which would cost about $80,000 in order to figure out what exactly the amount of money that you're charging developers to go into the Affordable Housing Trust would be in the first place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6201.131s">[Leming]</a>: And right now, I've been working with the planning office to figure out how to fund that study, what the study would look like, and just generally corresponding with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6211.26s">[Leming]</a>: In all likelihood, we wouldn't actually pass the ordinance until the study were conducted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6218.727s">[Leming]</a>: And so, you know, we would have a bit more of a basis for it, but I could talk for a while about the whole situation there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6286.889s">[Leming]</a>: So the point of doing these studies is that this can be looked at holistically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6292.113s">[Leming]</a>: The reason that we're not just<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6295.995s">[Leming]</a>: The reason that you don't just kind of arbitrarily come up with a number is because those situations might occur in the first place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6302.519s">[Leming]</a>: Right now, the planning office is trying to come up with funding to do a more comprehensive study on the other four buckets as well, just so that these situations don't actually happen, because you're right, you do need to account for a lot of other things, including what the city is already doing, the current costs of materials, labor,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6323.551s">[Leming]</a>: et cetera, et cetera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6324.472s">[Leming]</a>: And so that is the purpose of doing one of these, uh, one of these studies in the first place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6329.796s">[Leming]</a>: Again, the city hasn't done one in 34 years, so we really need to do one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6333.738s">[Leming]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=1977.67s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you for the presentation, Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=1981.712s">[Leming]</a>: So the question I have is that we have a couple of programs that are proposed on our wish list, which sort of relate to zoning incentives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=1992.578s">[Leming]</a>: So I've been pushing for the transportation demand management program to be implemented in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=1998.968s">[Leming]</a>: some forms that we could get developers more involved in the regional TMAs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2004.211s">[Leming]</a>: I've also, but there's also other aspects to this, like an inclusion, like affordable housing overlays and a few other programs that could affect, that could affect a developer's decision to build,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2022.578s">[Leming]</a>: to build housing, like the linkage program they were discussing last night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2025.779s">[Leming]</a>: I guess my question is, in the other cities that you've been studying, do they normally have a bunch of different incentive programs overlaid with each other that are integrated, or is it normally better to keep it more or less simple?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2201.861s">[Leming]</a>: personally speaking, my end all be all is Medford does need more affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2207.882s">[Leming]</a>: So whatever our zoning can do to disincentivize developers from building luxury units and to integrate more affordable housing and to make that more profitable for them would be ideal and whatever the best mechanism to do that is, I would support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2227.066s">[Leming]</a>: I would also, though, like programs that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2231.087s">[Leming]</a>: incentivize developers who come into Medford to sort of be more integrated into what's happening in the surrounding communities, just so that we're not so isolated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2242.078s">[Leming]</a>: And that's why I'm pushing for the TDM to be an important part of the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2248.725s">[Leming]</a>: So that's where I'm coming from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2250.147s">[Leming]</a>: And then the third<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2254.321s">[Leming]</a>: thing on my Christmas list is to make it so that it's not some, all of these rules put together are not some Byzantine kind of overly complex structure that developers can't really understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2268.368s">[Leming]</a>: So I understand that that could end up getting a little bit contradictory after a while, but it's sort of those three things are what's on my mind right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=187.614s">[Leming]</a>: Ken, can you turn the mic on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=1477.783s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2002.645s">[Leming]</a>: And thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2003.065s">[Leming]</a>: I'd just say I'd be willing to support these hours as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2007.249s">[Leming]</a>: I understand the concerns with consistency, but kind of two reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2011.572s">[Leming]</a>: So I think that part of the issue that we didn't want to approve the raising canes permit was just because of the, I think it was a little bit more visible from more houses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2033.303s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, I understand that there are residents across the street, but it's also not, I mean, Riverside Avenue is a fairly large road, and we did approve the special permit for Pinky's Pizza, which is a lot more of a closed-in neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2051.874s">[Leming]</a>: So I just, yeah, I think 1 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2055.996s">[Leming]</a>: in this case does make sense, just given the location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2059.778s">[Leming]</a>: That's my two cents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2063.083s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=5049.7s">[Leming]</a>: Motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=5050.361s">[Leming]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1050.924s">[Leming]</a>: Yes, thank you, and I'd be happy to second that motion, but I have one question for Marian O'Connor and I,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1059.514s">[Leming]</a>: I apologize if this already touched on during your initial, when you initially spoke about this just now, but can you talk specifically about the mechanisms for enforcing whatever the overgrowth ordinance is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1077.176s">[Leming]</a>: What concerns day-to-day do you run into when somebody has a lot of stuff in their yard that is attracting rodents?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1089.507s">[Leming]</a>: And what would you be looking for in a new ordinance that would help you in your ability to do your job better when you do run into those situations?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1159.998s">[Leming]</a>: It does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1161.639s">[Leming]</a>: Is there any other mechanisms that you've seen, you've heard about people using in other municipalities besides ticketing that just, that could work better?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1173.048s">[Leming]</a>: Because I often hear about enforcement of ordinances being an ongoing issue, especially with limited staffing capabilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1181.695s">[Leming]</a>: So if you've given any, if you've sort of heard about other instances of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1188.379s">[Leming]</a>: municipalities that are able to enforce what they do have, and would love to hear about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1226.552s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2474.206s">[Leming]</a>: and circulate those requirements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=2507.509s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=71.334s">[Leming]</a>: the Medford Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=76.656s">[Leming]</a>: We have two items on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=80.357s">[Leming]</a>: One is the resolution to publish a City Council newsletter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=83.279s">[Leming]</a>: The other is a resolution to create a residence guide to City Council procedures and processes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=91.662s">[Leming]</a>: So I am just going to go ahead and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=96.613s">[Leming]</a>: share my screen as to the draft that we came up with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=101.875s">[Leming]</a>: First, I apologize, I wasn't able to get this particular draft out during, wasn't able to get this particular draft out to folks before yesterday, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=120.458s">[Leming]</a>: We do have a version here now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=122.721s">[Leming]</a>: This was drafted by Anna and I also did some edits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=128.447s">[Leming]</a>: This version of the newsletter is essentially meant to, I'm just gonna see if there's a cleaner way to sort of zoom in on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=138.387s">[Leming]</a>: Okay, so this version of the newsletter covers the July to September 2024 period because we essentially skipped this over the summer because we only had two regular meetings during that month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=151.193s">[Leming]</a>: And otherwise, this just sort of, this just covers the different pieces of committee work that were done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=157.876s">[Leming]</a>: Throws in the commemorations as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=161.618s">[Leming]</a>: So if,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=166.212s">[Leming]</a>: So essentially, just going over very briefly, July 23rd, the condolences to the family of MPS teacher Robin Irving, September 10th, to family of Frank Zizzo, September 10th, recognized September's National Recovery Month, and then celebrate the importance of the Chevalier Theatre and Gene Mack Gym on the 17th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=191.538s">[Leming]</a>: The general business goes over<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=195.455s">[Leming]</a>: The newly created stabilization fund September 10th covers the whole petition to the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=201.579s">[Leming]</a>: state house, as well as the approval of the wildlife feeding ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=206.943s">[Leming]</a>: A couple of other financial things that were also done on September 10th, the electrical vehicle charging revolving fund and the refunding loan order, essentially to get better rates on some city bonds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=225.157s">[Leming]</a>: September 17th also,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=229.666s">[Leming]</a>: approved late night hours for Panda Express.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=232.807s">[Leming]</a>: And on July 23rd, this details how we chose to not move forward with a second independent audit of the city, since we already had an independent audit every year, as noted during the meeting in July.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=247.911s">[Leming]</a>: And just some of the individual committees are only just starting to meet again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=255.333s">[Leming]</a>: So the governance committee, I noted here how<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=258.979s">[Leming]</a>: It hasn't met, but it did receive a referral from a regular meeting to start considering charter reforms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=275.25s">[Leming]</a>: The Charter Study Committee wraps up its work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=278.352s">[Leming]</a>: So that's just a mechanism, essentially, to start discussing that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=284.875s">[Leming]</a>: Planning and permitting committee did meet over the summer and this just goes over some of the activity that we've been doing for INS Associates and the planning department and the public health and community safety committee worked on the wildlife feeding ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=306.687s">[Leming]</a>: Noticing a typo here just now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=313.044s">[Leming]</a>: I do think, uh, Emily, uh, Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=495.274s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=516.974s">[Leming]</a>: Are you recommending to start off this whole paragraph by saying the city is working very hard to address the rodent problem?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=550.805s">[Leming]</a>: What about overgrowth ordinance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=586.996s">[Leming]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=589.258s">[Leming]</a>: I mean, they were sort of mixed into that one committee meeting, but I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=601.156s">[Leming]</a>: There's a lot of traffic today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=623.268s">[Leming]</a>: Can you look up the, wait, what was the date of this committee meeting again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=625.871s">[Leming]</a>: That's Tuesday, September 17th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=668.042s">[Leming]</a>: I mean, I think we did work on both of that committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=682.645s">[Leming]</a>: I believe if my memory serves right, so I could just say that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=823.104s">[Leming]</a>: And then we have the one in August.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=858.513s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=926.882s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=935.351s">[Leming]</a>: Sorry, can you speak up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=954.795s">[Leming]</a>: My brain's blinking a little bit here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=956.557s">[Leming]</a>: What is a good way to summarize all the discussions on the overgrowth and rodent control ordinances?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=963.222s">[Leming]</a>: Those are, to be honest, those are kind of like mixing together at this point for me, between the wildlife feeding and the overgrowth and rodent control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=994.624s">[Leming]</a>: I mean, the crossed out stuff isn't going to be...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1036.676s">[Leming]</a>: In a sense, it will help us reduce our issues with rats and other unwanted animals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1045.261s">[Leming]</a>: Additionally, I'm just going to say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1061.115s">[Leming]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1064.577s">[Leming]</a>: And then again, I'm going, once I actually format this, I'm just going to blow it up with links to the actual drafts of the ordinances themselves, which is half the purpose of this thing to begin with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1078.287s">[Leming]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1079.528s">[Leming]</a>: It's a bit of a bit of a long paragraph, but it basically summarizes that the public health and community safety committee is trying to work on the rodent issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1093.297s">[Leming]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1094.718s">[Leming]</a>: Justin, how close are you to City Hall?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1145.268s">[Leming]</a>: Trying to think of, I could just say mini constitution, but this is analogous to a constitution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1163.195s">[Leming]</a>: Anna might have an idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1234.648s">[Leming]</a>: City Charters, the Charters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1245.81s">[Leming]</a>: I should say finalizes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1251.952s">[Leming]</a>: City Charters, the Governor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1253.432s">[Leming]</a>: All right, Councilor Tseng has just entered the room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1278.855s">[Leming]</a>: Alright, I like things in lists of three but I'm having trouble thinking of something besides this as an example of what the charter covers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1418.655s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, that this is, I mean, it was, I think, I think this is work on the charter is probably going to be covered pretty extensively in future newsletters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1427.861s">[Leming]</a>: And this is really meant, I mean, really all that happened is that's fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1431.784s">[Leming]</a>: Now we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1432.85s">[Leming]</a>: there was a resolution that was referred directly to committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1449.623s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1533.753s">[Leming]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1534.753s">[Leming]</a>: I was thinking maybe finalize this recommendations or finalize its drafts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1554.855s">[Leming]</a>: Um, clarify Councilor, is Councilor Scarpelli here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1559.698s">[Leming]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1572.625s">[Leming]</a>: Um, I'm going to go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1576.327s">[Leming]</a>: And, um, is there any other parts of the newsletter that folks would like to comment on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1583.915s">[Leming]</a>: I think that we need to go over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1586.296s">[Leming]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1595.379s">[Leming]</a>: In that case, is there any public, is there any public participation in this matter?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1601.021s">[Leming]</a>: There's nobody currently in the chamber, but there are some folks on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1605.542s">[Leming]</a>: So if you'd like to offer input onto this current draft of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1613.433s">[Leming]</a>: under this current draft of the newsletter, feel free.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1615.495s">[Leming]</a>: In that case, do we have a motion on the floor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1623.802s">[Leming]</a>: Motion approves it for publication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1626.344s">[Leming]</a>: I have a motion to approve for publication by Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1630.827s">[Leming]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1633.73s">[Leming]</a>: Seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1640.08s">[Leming]</a>: I did see iPhone on Zoom, but I'm not seeing it anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1644.903s">[Leming]</a>: So I don't think Councilor Scarpelli is on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1649.106s">[Leming]</a>: So we can just do a voice vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1652.728s">[Leming]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1653.428s">[Leming]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1654.489s">[Leming]</a>: All those opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1655.83s">[Leming]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1659.792s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1660.873s">[Leming]</a>: We'll get this formatted and hold on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1668.137s">[Leming]</a>: did have a note from Zoom reminding members to turn their mics on when they talk just so that it can be, just so that everybody can hear them that's listening in and for the recording.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1683.307s">[Leming]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1685.588s">[Leming]</a>: Now, 24370 offered by Councilor Tseng, a resolution to create a residence guide to City Council's procedures and processes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1695.731s">[Leming]</a>: So I have the draft that Councilor Tseng shared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1702.036s">[Leming]</a>: And again, apologies that this is not, this was not in the initial agenda, but folks put in some work over the weekend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1717.568s">[Leming]</a>: And if that is, all right, seems to be good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1722.452s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1793.0s">[Leming]</a>: Just one that comes to mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1795.582s">[Leming]</a>: It says that we pass<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1799.147s">[Leming]</a>: resolutions right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1800.287s">[Leming]</a>: I think, or sorry, we pass ordinances right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1802.388s">[Leming]</a>: I think that some, the use of the word resolution is also, would also be good just to kind of include right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1809.691s">[Leming]</a>: Like we pass resolutions, then an explanation of what that is, ordinances, and zoning regulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1856.123s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Cownie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1946.172s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2153.206s">[Leming]</a>: just to follow up on that, there always is a balance that needs to be struck with these kinds of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2163.772s">[Leming]</a>: And I don't think that we can write, I don't think we can write anything down on a piece of paper that will work for every single person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2179.922s">[Leming]</a>: What I think would happen is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2182.851s">[Leming]</a>: matter what we end up approving in this committee, it'll go out and then people, some people will really help out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2190.614s">[Leming]</a>: I think overall do very good, but people will also start to come to us with like problems with like, I had no idea what I was talking about here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2198.117s">[Leming]</a>: And over time, we'll get real world feedback from that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2201.479s">[Leming]</a>: So it could be a process whereby we could go back and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2204.68s">[Leming]</a>: update it later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2205.581s">[Leming]</a>: So that's a way to say that I completely agree with everything that Councilor Lazzaro said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2212.049s">[Leming]</a>: I am not opposed to releasing an imperfect product because I don't think that, I think that any discussions we have here<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2223.646s">[Leming]</a>: we'll just end up becoming theoretical and the best feedback we'll get is if we release something and then people use it and then bring that to us over time so we could release a version two, you know, after a while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2239.546s">[Leming]</a>: That's my thoughts on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2240.928s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2278.24s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2373.437s">[Leming]</a>: Council Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2418.181s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, I think this would need to be referred to, I think a good way to form that motion would be to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2427.706s">[Leming]</a>: Um move this for approval to the regular council subject to the edits that we've given to Councilor Tseng this session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2437.933s">[Leming]</a>: Before we do that, I just wanted to ask, is there any public participation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2443.077s">[Leming]</a>: I see we have some folks on Zoom who might want to offer input on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2448.801s">[Leming]</a>: Alright, I'm not seeing any raised hands.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2453.003s">[Leming]</a>: Oh, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2453.744s">[Leming]</a>: Oh, we have Eileen<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2457.25s">[Leming]</a>: Learner on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2458.835s">[Leming]</a>: Hold on a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2461.282s">[Leming]</a>: Yep, I have to unmute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2497.794s">[Leming]</a>: So I think, I believe that Councilor Tseng, we saw your comment in the chat and I believe Councilor Tseng just said that he would add something to the participation rules about the fact that we will have a sign up sheet and typically do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2517.489s">[Leming]</a>: It's just our, we don't have a city messenger at the moment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2522.492s">[Leming]</a>: So that might've been why this particular draft<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2527.765s">[Leming]</a>: didn't include that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2548.073s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Tseng?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2549.874s">[Leming]</a>: Okay, yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2551.434s">[Leming]</a>: Justin just said that he<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2554.535s">[Leming]</a>: Justin just said that he added it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2555.756s">[Leming]</a>: So the version that we refer to the regular council meeting will have will tell people explicitly that they can sign up to participate and don't have to wait in line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2572.562s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you, Eileen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2577.864s">[Leming]</a>: We have a motion on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2596.092s">[Leming]</a>: That were recommended at this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2598.674s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2599.895s">[Leming]</a>: Seconded by Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2603.198s">[Leming]</a>: Clerk, do you have that written down?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2610.643s">[Leming]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2611.283s">[Leming]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2612.864s">[Leming]</a>: Opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2613.925s">[Leming]</a>: Motion passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2616.427s">[Leming]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2618.048s">[Leming]</a>: Do we have any other motions on the floor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2625.012s">[Leming]</a>: Motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2629.395s">[Leming]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2630.176s">[Leming]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2631.176s">[Leming]</a>: Opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2632.097s">[Leming]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2632.857s">[Leming]</a>: Motion passed 3 to 1.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2641.36s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you, everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2642.162s">[Leming]</a>: Have a wonderful Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=187.987s">[Leming]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=188.287s">[Leming]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=188.608s">[Leming]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=189.128s">[Leming]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=189.908s">[Leming]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2290.894s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2291.575s">[Leming]</a>: Um, so<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2293.982s">[Leming]</a>: Right now, sorry, just to, Council President Bears, just to clarify, was your suggestion to replace the Southwest parcel there that differs between A and B with mixed-use one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2359.518s">[Leming]</a>: Okay, yeah, for I mean, yeah, for the for the stuff that's like right next to the mistook I could definitely see the argument for making that into mixed use one but for yeah for the rest of that area like I run around that kind of spot of that parcel land all the time and it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2376.207s">[Leming]</a>: It's very underutilized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2377.568s">[Leming]</a>: There's like two banks there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2378.569s">[Leming]</a>: So I think it absolutely makes sense to build higher properties there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2387.516s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, yeah, no, no, that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2389.597s">[Leming]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2389.838s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, I thought I misheard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2391.679s">[Leming]</a>: I thought you were suggesting to make that entire thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2393.981s">[Leming]</a>: No, excuse one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2395.122s">[Leming]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2396.563s">[Leming]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2398.843s">[Leming]</a>: General question about this, because I'm kind of thinking about what that would look like between mixed use, between option A and B. Which of the mixed use three versus mixed use four would developers normally be inclined to go for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2415.533s">[Leming]</a>: Is there a situation where we decide on one and then developers are like, well, I don't think it's worth it to do that, but they wouldn't do that for the other?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2425.992s">[Leming]</a>: What I'm thinking of is like when we do pass one of these, would there be any difference in sort of estimated uptake of that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2565.107s">[Leming]</a>: So just sorry, just just to summarize, like, so in theory, it sounded like that was kind of an implicit endorsement of option A, which is, you know, has more of the mixed use mixed use for which is sort of denser, but not quite as high.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2580.393s">[Leming]</a>: But what you were just saying now is that developers were, they didn't in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2587.02s">[Leming]</a>: In practice, they didn't really seem to care about the specific heights as much as the sort of depth of affordability when they were building housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2594.922s">[Leming]</a>: When they were building housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2670.304s">[Leming]</a>: more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2670.604s">[Leming]</a>: So follow up to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2671.725s">[Leming]</a>: So what all of the different rules and incentives that are, um, that make developers make these decisions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2679.247s">[Leming]</a>: Would those be baked into the zoning at the ordinance level?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2682.468s">[Leming]</a>: Or would those be baked into rules that are sort of decided to staff level as a result of studies?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2739.025s">[Leming]</a>: kind of trying to avoid is that when, you know, all of this has passed, if we end up baking in some rules that end up being really difficult to change, it just end up not working, or that end up just discouraging development, and then would have to go back and sort of redo all this versus, you know, some of these incentive zoning programs that we're talking about that could potentially be changed, sort of more at the staff level after, you know, a consultant does a study on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2807.957s">[Leming]</a>: No, no, I'd like to hear more about this subject, but I don't have any more specific questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4247.2s">[Leming]</a>: Uh, Councilor, let me, sorry, just a real, um, personal idiot check question on my part here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4254.005s">[Leming]</a>: So, I mean, with option with option,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4257.97s">[Leming]</a>: be like, we would need incentive zoning, correct, to implement the other programs that we're talking about as part of our, as part of the zoning overhaul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4268.977s">[Leming]</a>: So, like, would, like, we would need this in, we would need kind of those incentives to build higher for, like, for implementing, like, a TDM program, for instance, or some kind of, some kind of green incentives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4286.208s">[Leming]</a>: Is that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4287.47s">[Leming]</a>: And so if we go with option A, that's just all out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4290.382s">[Leming]</a>: Is that no?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4330.052s">[Leming]</a>: Well, on the next slide that we were just looking at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4366.925s">[Leming]</a>: Listen, I'm a very simple person, you gotta.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=64.438s">[Leming]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=67.22s">[Leming]</a>: Chair Callahan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1237.548s">[Leming]</a>: Just a question about, so to be clear, this is the resolution, host a future discussion, invite MassDOT to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1244.831s">[Leming]</a>: What would be the logistics of that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1247.392s">[Leming]</a>: Would that be another committee meeting that they and the Bicycle Commission are here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1253.655s">[Leming]</a>: Would it be a public forum, open meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1257.196s">[Leming]</a>: Can you clarify that a little bit?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1295.8s">[Leming]</a>: Just asking for clarification on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/nmhVrAiqiHw&t=1297.28s">[Leming]</a>: Cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=149.16s">[Leming]</a>: I find the records in order and motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=285.93s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you, Council President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=288.051s">[Leming]</a>: At the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee meeting, we drafted and approved the summer newsletter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=296.936s">[Leming]</a>: I'd like to thank Councilor Callahan for drafting that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=302.039s">[Leming]</a>: And we then discussed and edited the Residence Guide to City Council, which is in this current agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=311.144s">[Leming]</a>: I would like to thank Councilor Tseng for drafting that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=317.07s">[Leming]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=322.853s">[Leming]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=616.206s">[Leming]</a>: Motion to table for later in the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1946.288s">[Leming]</a>: I would like to make a an additional motion to make an additional amendment to the request for information from Mr. DeRocco, which is, I'd just like to know what is the, just what is the estimated value of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=1966.033s">[Leming]</a>: taxable, the property that would be taxable on the on the Medford side of the Tufts campus, thereby getting an estimate of how much they would pay in taxes if they weren't exempted from that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3317.619s">[Leming]</a>: I will go to Councilor Leming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3322.557s">[Leming]</a>: I was actually going to make a motion to invite the members of the school committee to come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=5311.248s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=6545.186s">[Leming]</a>: I'm ready.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=6548.227s">[Leming]</a>: You didn't say please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=6549.568s">[Leming]</a>: It's please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=6623.609s">[Leming]</a>: Motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1338.49s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1339.49s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, I see these photos and they look horrifying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1342.852s">[Leming]</a>: So thank you for putting in this request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1345.513s">[Leming]</a>: Just only question, you said that these are 40 years old, are the new telephone poles that you plan to install, what is the expected shelf life for those?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1899.063s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you, I'd just like to know, could this funding have come from the CPA and are there other Brooks Estate projects at the moment with active CPA funding?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1943.649s">[Leming]</a>: Got it, so this is an historic preservation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1945.771s">[Leming]</a>: I think that clarified my question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1947.912s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=1952.576s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2238.732s">[Leming]</a>: No, I didn't entirely follow that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2241.633s">[Leming]</a>: I would motion to approve and send this to regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2586.004s">[Leming]</a>: Motion to approve and send to committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/tjD3t7CBx-E&t=2589.627s">[Leming]</a>: Motion to regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1163.436s">[Leming]</a>: I'll second that motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1197.363s">[Leming]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1197.783s">[Leming]</a>: Clerk, can you turn your microphone on, please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1206.165s">[Leming]</a>: You may repeat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1208.446s">[Leming]</a>: It's very quiet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1209.686s">[Leming]</a>: I still can't quite.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1212.687s">[Leming]</a>: Just for the audio recording.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1214.347s">[Leming]</a>: I can hear you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1215.487s">[Leming]</a>: It's just very quiet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1216.247s">[Leming]</a>: I think it's through someone else's mic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1265.666s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=1363.058s">[Leming]</a>: Summary's good for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EZNSKYxjrUE&t=2085.204s">[Leming]</a>: Motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2770.646s">[Leming]</a>: Rose, we had a we had a very short city council meeting, but sorry, I wanted to, I just wanted to add on to what Zach was saying about the long term financial plan of the city, which was a lot of what city council doing is right<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2788.795s">[Leming]</a>: Right now, is establishing sort of the instruments of municipal finance and governance that other surrounding towns have sort of taken for granted for a very long time and I don't think that's always obvious to people who are looking in a good example is the stabilization funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2807.601s">[Leming]</a>: you know, we decided to create a couple of rainy day funds and allocate some cash into them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2815.203s">[Leming]</a>: And that's something that the vast majority of cities in Massachusetts have had forever that this city council only recently actually instituted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2825.285s">[Leming]</a>: Only last year we established an affordable housing trust so that we put some money towards affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2830.707s">[Leming]</a>: That was something that Somerville established like 30 years ago and it's been collecting money ever<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2837.563s">[Leming]</a>: ever since.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2839.865s">[Leming]</a>: Our zoning really should have been overhauled a very long time ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2845.971s">[Leming]</a>: With regards to a lot of the HR issues that were just being discussed earlier, that's not just a case for getting retrograde, it's not just a case for the teachers union, it's a case for all<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2859.262s">[Leming]</a>: pretty much all city staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2861.163s">[Leming]</a>: We asked HR that during a meeting a couple months ago, and they said they don't have the financial software to do those calculations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2870.165s">[Leming]</a>: They literally have to calculate everything by hand on paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2873.926s">[Leming]</a>: That's not something that most other organizations have to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2879.668s">[Leming]</a>: A lot of our long-term financial planning, just to be clear, is establishing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2887.543s">[Leming]</a>: be, it's just getting things that other areas have taken for granted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2892.204s">[Leming]</a>: So I just wanted to make that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2894.265s">[Leming]</a>: I'll get off the panel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=927.982s">[Leming]</a>: I had a question on Medford's current definition of dormitories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=935.827s">[Leming]</a>: And I'm just trying to get an idea for myself of the practical cases where these different definitions would differ.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=944.465s">[Leming]</a>: Our current one is building designed for or occupied as a residence for students or staff owned by or under the supervision of an institution or an educational use which is not operated as a gainful business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=958.168s">[Leming]</a>: With the wording for that, could that be understood as, could you like have an apartment complex or a house which is owned by an institution of some sort, even like a private equity firm, but ends up housing mostly students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=978.28s">[Leming]</a>: Would that be reclassified as dormitory under our current ordinances?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1178.478s">[Leming]</a>: I think my other concern with this definition is specified building designed by or occupied as a residence for students or staff so it's that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1188.891s">[Leming]</a>: It's that or right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1189.971s">[Leming]</a>: So what I'm thinking is that one year it could be occupied by all renters who are working in Boston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1198.574s">[Leming]</a>: They all move out and then a bunch of students move in there and suddenly it's reclassified as a dormitory automatically just because it might not have been designed for that purpose, but now they're occupied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1210.538s">[Leming]</a>: It's now occupied by them that you see what I'm saying there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1260.414s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, I'm just trying to understand how... I'm just trying to go over the implications of the current definition, just add food for thought for changing it in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1467.044s">[Leming]</a>: Well, I could make that as a motion, but I would like to bring up with the Cambridge definition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1474.849s">[Leming]</a>: Director Hunt, what do you think of the idea of striking the phrase for persons whose permanent residence is elsewhere?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1548.241s">[Leming]</a>: So I guess I'll motion to adopt the Cambridge definition of a dormitory striking the words for persons whose permanent residence is elsewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1560.532s">[Leming]</a>: And.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1562.133s">[Leming]</a>: And.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1566.217s">[Leming]</a>: So striking whose permanent residence is elsewhere and.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1612.974s">[Leming]</a>: Just whose permanent residence is elsewhere and.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=122.134s">[Leming]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1714.838s">[Leming]</a>: I'm going to try to respond to one thing there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1716.578s">[Leming]</a>: I didn't hear a specific question, but you did say that Medford's not like our surrounding towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1724.02s">[Leming]</a>: No, I said Winchester.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1725.081s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, we're not like Winchester.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1726.521s">[Leming]</a>: 90% of cities in the state of Massachusetts have had an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1732.203s">[Leming]</a>: Medford has one of the lowest operating budgets per capita of any city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1741.625s">[Leming]</a>: midsize city in the state of Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1744.446s">[Leming]</a>: And that is in large part because we are one of the 10% of cities that has never had an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1751.749s">[Leming]</a>: So you're right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1752.409s">[Leming]</a>: We are not like our neighbors that have had overrides and we have less money for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2282.138s">[Leming]</a>: Saying that we can address the budgetary problems of the Medford public school system with free cash is like me saying the government gave me a $1,200 check from COVID.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2295.965s">[Leming]</a>: So I don't have to look for a job right now because that check is going to last me another<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2301.493s">[Leming]</a>: another two weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2303.313s">[Leming]</a>: It's the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2304.153s">[Leming]</a>: The government gave us, the government gave the city of Method some money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2308.554s">[Leming]</a>: It was a one-time thing from COVID and the proposal that we can plug ongoing costs from free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2315.175s">[Leming]</a>: All that would do is drain our reserves and we'd be back at square one in five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2323.137s">[Leming]</a>: If these overrides don't pass straight up, there will be layoffs in the school system and the roads will continue to be in disrepair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2330.538s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2792.681s">[Leming]</a>: So adding on to what Councilor Callahan said, partially this is due to the lingering costs of COVID, which resulted in both decreased funding going to the school system, partially that was just because you have fewer students going into public schools, and partially because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2812.608s">[Leming]</a>: there was a lot of activity in the healthcare system from COVID.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2815.793s">[Leming]</a>: So there is a sort of a, so the cost of health insurance, which we have to pay ended up rising.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2821.504s">[Leming]</a>: Those are some of the more short term reasons why we need this now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2824.809s">[Leming]</a>: Longer term,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2826.321s">[Leming]</a>: The way that Prop 2 NAP is designed is the total amount of money that the city can take in basically can't go up by more than 2.5% every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2836.11s">[Leming]</a>: While inflation has averaged for the past 44 years at 3.1% over time, that compounds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2842.436s">[Leming]</a>: So the budget today<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2844.137s">[Leming]</a>: is only a fraction, well, it's only about 78% as valuable today as it was back in 1980.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2852.464s">[Leming]</a>: So Prop 2.5 has this effect long-term on municipal budget where it squeezes resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2858.929s">[Leming]</a>: Most cities in Massachusetts have addressed this with the intended mechanism for overcoming this, which is periodic elections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2867.675s">[Leming]</a>: This is just the first time we're doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2869.677s">[Leming]</a>: That's part of the reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2871.318s">[Leming]</a>: the fact that we're so late to the game there is part of the reason that again we are 320 out of 351 cities in terms of our per capita budget and that is the reason why our schools could definitely be doing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2887.594s">[Leming]</a>: better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2888.174s">[Leming]</a>: That is the reason why you see so many potholes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2890.435s">[Leming]</a>: This is one step in addressing that situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2894.918s">[Leming]</a>: Once again, free cash, one time funding is not an actual longer term solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2902.141s">[Leming]</a>: If we just went with free cash, that would be drained in a couple of years, even shorter than the four to five year span I put, I said earlier, and then that's time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4482.151s">[Leming]</a>: I'm sorry, just to go back on that 3 to 5% thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4484.993s">[Leming]</a>: It's not 3 to 5% in totality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4486.713s">[Leming]</a>: It actually is recommended to generate 3 to 5% in free cash every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4491.036s">[Leming]</a>: So that is correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4492.717s">[Leming]</a>: I'm not sure where you're getting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4497.639s">[Leming]</a>: You can Google it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4498.64s">[Leming]</a>: You can look it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4499.32s">[Leming]</a>: I encourage you to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4501.161s">[Leming]</a>: But the point is, you generate three to 5% in free cash, and then it goes that can aggregate over time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4506.984s">[Leming]</a>: And then that can go towards one time capital expenditures, like for instance, two new fire trucks for the fire department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4513.427s">[Leming]</a>: That's how these big, that's how these sort of, I'd say, midsize expenses are accounted for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4520.003s">[Leming]</a>: Again, if I have a savings account and I'm living above my means, then eventually the savings account would run out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4531.491s">[Leming]</a>: So you're not supposed to plug the school budget every single year with free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4537.594s">[Leming]</a>: because it would run out eventually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4540.115s">[Leming]</a>: We did that with $1.75 million this past year with the understanding that we would then do an override to try to fix the problem in the long term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4549.658s">[Leming]</a>: Free cash is not a long-term solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4552.459s">[Leming]</a>: That keeps getting repeated, and I really just want to drive the point home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4556.04s">[Leming]</a>: It is not actually an answer to this problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4645.897s">[Leming]</a>: So in terms of how much free cash we actually have left, I don't have the numbers right in front of me, but I'm just remembering the expenditures off the top of my head.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4656.42s">[Leming]</a>: I believe after it was certified this past June, the number was 34 million, but I believe enough of that has been earmarked for various one-time expenditures at this point so that the actual number is, correct me if I'm wrong, would be about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4671.222s">[Leming]</a>: 10 to 11 million in reserves right now just because I see so much I can see someone shaking their head in the audience but I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4682.905s">[Leming]</a>: So again, this is ballpark numbers because we did allocate free cash first for the stabilization funds, which recently went to things like those light posts that were falling over, that were, you know, rusted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4698.65s">[Leming]</a>: They went to $3 million for the MSBA study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4703.732s">[Leming]</a>: It went to pay for HVAC systems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4707.833s">[Leming]</a>: It went to pay for, there was a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4713.5s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, there's a long list of items that were in some memos from a couple of months ago that I think some of my colleagues could help me out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5408.745s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Leming, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5412.126s">[Leming]</a>: I'd just like to really emphasize that if you're interested in learning more about the shortfalls in the school, in the Medford Public Schools budget, then the videos and the presentations that were given during the budget season at the Medford School Committee meetings, I believe around June, would be where you want to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5432.612s">[Leming]</a>: So those are on YouTube.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5433.752s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5828.308s">[Leming]</a>: So for the size of the override, what I'll say is that we got, we went 44 years without an override, and this is the first time that we're asking the voters to do an override, which has become very commonplace in other communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5846.658s">[Leming]</a>: And so, yeah, if we, you know, there potentially is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5853.301s">[Leming]</a>: a debt exclusion in the future for the high school as a capital project, but just in terms of level expenses, the overrides are a mechanism to undo, to overcome the effects of inflation long-term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5869.773s">[Leming]</a>: So I will just point out that we've gone this long without an override, and this is the first time that we're asking for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5877.867s">[Leming]</a>: We've survived pretty long so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5881.669s">[Leming]</a>: And we're pretty late to the game, to be honest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5886.753s">[Leming]</a>: Will another override be needed in another 44 years?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5890.635s">[Leming]</a>: Maybe, because inflation will keep going up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5894.017s">[Leming]</a>: But right now, we know that we need this, or else, again, the roads will continue to be in the state that they're in, and we will have to have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5904.376s">[Leming]</a>: a lot of layoffs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5905.357s">[Leming]</a>: That's not a scare tactic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5906.457s">[Leming]</a>: That's just the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5907.798s">[Leming]</a>: It's just math.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5908.739s">[Leming]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7343.632s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7344.352s">[Leming]</a>: So I would like to point out that in asking for specifics for these things, there is a bit of a kind of a circular logic that goes in because if hypothetically we were to put forward to the voters the exact pay scale of each teacher in each line item, that's not really possible because union contracts haven't actually been negotiated, haven't been negotiated yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7366.819s">[Leming]</a>: So that would be premature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7371.861s">[Leming]</a>: No, no, no, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7376.284s">[Leming]</a>: And so, I mean, it goes for a lot of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7380.147s">[Leming]</a>: It goes for the development of the plans for a fire station as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7385.03s">[Leming]</a>: So you don't have to have the plans completely finalized and approved, but you can have a estimate for the full cost of the station from the people that are developing the plans beforehand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7397.218s">[Leming]</a>: Right now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7398.178s">[Leming]</a>: estimate is $30 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7400.48s">[Leming]</a>: And it goes, I mean, it goes for the salaries as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7404.282s">[Leming]</a>: So, you know, we are, we put in the ballot questions, the areas where it would go to, but we can't say it will go to 10 teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7413.529s">[Leming]</a>: It will go to 15 parents, et cetera, because those need to be negotiated after the fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7418.632s">[Leming]</a>: On the other hand, if, on the other hand, if we do<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7421.574s">[Leming]</a>: I've also heard people say, OK, how can you promise higher wages, for instance, if those contracts haven't been negotiated?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7428.961s">[Leming]</a>: So this becomes a bit of a chicken and egg problem when asking for specifics versus not being specific enough on these valid questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7436.549s">[Leming]</a>: I'd just like to make that general point, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8495.515s">[Leming]</a>: Well, just to make the point that if you have a, you know, we, this is a request to pay slightly more property taxes, but it also goes along with the general point of, yeah, $37 a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8509.626s">[Leming]</a>: That's, that is slightly more, you know, with the, to go along with the general point of you get what you pay for,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8519.887s">[Leming]</a>: Again, we are a very underfunded city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8524.112s">[Leming]</a>: And we would like that to not be the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8527.216s">[Leming]</a>: And this is a step in the right direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8530.96s">[Leming]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9071.544s">[Leming]</a>: I'm sorry, where is the woman who asked the question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9079.227s">[Leming]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9080.028s">[Leming]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9081.208s">[Leming]</a>: No, I just wanted to point out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9082.309s">[Leming]</a>: So there was, so I've seen this, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9085.566s">[Leming]</a>: error that people have been doing with the DLS calculator the past week or so, where they're taking the $7.5 million that comes from questions seven and eight combined, and then they're just adding that to the $30 million and then saying... I think she just added the $2 million for the estimated... Yeah, that is actually...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9600.659s">[Leming]</a>: So first, just to make the point that disagreeing doesn't mean it's a fear attack, it just means I disagree with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9607.391s">[Leming]</a>: Just want to put that out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9609.082s">[Leming]</a>: The actual answer to that is that the communities that haven't had to do Prop 2.5 overrides to keep a level budget are either the communities that have just much bigger budgets overall than we do, like Boston, or in cases like Cambridge, they invested in areas like Kendall Square years and years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9633.961s">[Leming]</a>: Medford could have invested in that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9638.504s">[Leming]</a>: kind of development a long time ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9640.045s">[Leming]</a>: We just never did that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9641.847s">[Leming]</a>: And smaller communities that don't really have the opportunity to do that sort of commercial development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9646.891s">[Leming]</a>: Some towns are basically just residential properties and not a whole lot of commercial activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9653.596s">[Leming]</a>: They have to do these sorts of overrides regularly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9656.258s">[Leming]</a>: So Medford kind of avoided this by just doing cuts and cuts and cuts until we became a very underfunded community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9663.879s">[Leming]</a>: And now that we're at this point, there's really not much of a choice except for either kicking the can down the road more, which doesn't solve the problem, or doing one of these overrides like Our Neighbors, or we could get a time machine and do a lot more commercial development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9682.142s">[Leming]</a>: But of course, that's not an option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9683.603s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10017.063s">[Leming]</a>: I mean, I think we've already gone over the free cash issue quite a bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10025.929s">[Leming]</a>: It wouldn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10027.69s">[Leming]</a>: That's the answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10029.412s">[Leming]</a>: We used $1.75 million in free cash to plug the budget with the understanding that we would have an override coming up on the ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10040.379s">[Leming]</a>: I think what my colleague is saying is that we should do that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10044.041s">[Leming]</a>: another year and then do an override the next year or so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10048.262s">[Leming]</a>: But it's, I'm honestly a bit confused why it keeps coming up as a solution to all of our problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10055.585s">[Leming]</a>: Cause it's not like you just can't use free cash year after year for salaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10061.486s">[Leming]</a>: That's not the way it works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10063.087s">[Leming]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11455.848s">[Leming]</a>: Let's move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11459.33s">[Leming]</a>: We still have a City Council meeting to go to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12478.72s">[Leming]</a>: Now, Councilor Collins said a lot of points that I was going to make, which is to get the bird's eye view.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12486.546s">[Leming]</a>: Most of this council is pretty, is fairly new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12489.508s">[Leming]</a>: About half of us are in our first term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12493.231s">[Leming]</a>: And so we are trying to lay the foundations for the further growth and development of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12500.336s">[Leming]</a>: The most important thing, the most important component of that is the zoning overhaul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12506.232s">[Leming]</a>: a couple of meetings ago, I brought up a linkage fee proposal which would essentially raise the fees that developers pay for the first time to the city for their developments for the first time in 30 years that passed this council six to one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12521.824s">[Leming]</a>: I think that you'll find that we are intensely focused on the financials so that we will have growth for the next 10 years, for the next 20 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12532.312s">[Leming]</a>: In general, this city,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12536.278s">[Leming]</a>: a lot of the political history of this city has been sort of attempting to kick the can down the road or just say, oh, or just come up with like vague ways to say, oh, we should all come together and find solutions, but not actually ever backing anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12551.79s">[Leming]</a>: This council is actually laying the foundations and passing actual ordinances and legislation so that we won't have to worry about that in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12563.379s">[Leming]</a>: So yes, we are building a foundation that should have been built a very long time ago, and these overrides are really meant to address more short-term concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12573.108s">[Leming]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13410.931s">[Leming]</a>: So speaking a bit more of a bird's eye view of this, I do wish that things were better between the fire union and the mayor and that that process had gone better for both parties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13426.218s">[Leming]</a>: And I am sorry at how that has evolved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13429.5s">[Leming]</a>: My view of this is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13433.078s">[Leming]</a>: even is that the debt exclusion is about funding and it's not, I don't see it as necessarily being tied to whatever plans come out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13443.166s">[Leming]</a>: That's just how I view it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13446.849s">[Leming]</a>: So that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14169.056s">[Leming]</a>: I'm going to try to give more of a personal perspective of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14175.081s">[Leming]</a>: It's a good question, one that hasn't been directly addressed in these chambers too much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14179.085s">[Leming]</a>: I think, honestly, what we're seeing here is a bit of a generational divide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14185.65s">[Leming]</a>: So I think that previous generations of politicians quite literally came from a different part of town.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14196.069s">[Leming]</a>: I've literally analyzed this myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14197.53s">[Leming]</a>: I put up a blog post about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14198.831s">[Leming]</a>: And so there's a lot of people in the city who are used to having this personal relationship with their elected officials, because they're literally the people that they grew up with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14209.037s">[Leming]</a>: But over time, the demographics of Medford have shifted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14214.96s">[Leming]</a>: You have a much younger generation of voters, a lot more people moving in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14220.324s">[Leming]</a>: And so there's a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14223.26s">[Leming]</a>: And so most, I mean, most of the city Councilors these days live in just literally a completely different geographical part of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14231.411s">[Leming]</a>: And so I've spoken to, you know, there's been a lot of angry meetings and there is like some folks who've come up and said, you know, very<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14239.918s">[Leming]</a>: unpleasant things to me, who I've later had very good one-on-one conversations with, and they've said, well, Matt, people are scared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14248.006s">[Leming]</a>: And I do think that in some cases that is the case, because they feel like they don't really know, at a personal level, some of the folks here, just because we do come<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14264.611s">[Leming]</a>: we are like literally living in a different part of town.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14267.852s">[Leming]</a>: Um, so I think that, I think that these sorts of things will heal, um, will heal over time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14274.693s">[Leming]</a>: Um, I think it's a matter of, I'm trying to figure out like who, uh, that comes to these meetings is willing to have a nice one-on-one conversation, develop those relationships.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14284.515s">[Leming]</a>: Not everybody is, but some people are, so it will heal with time is my take on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=639.707s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=640.928s">[Leming]</a>: So, when I first in the time before, and I ran for council in the time that I was running one thing that I learned is that there are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=653.123s">[Leming]</a>: a lot of people in the city who hold politics above personal relationships.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=659.949s">[Leming]</a>: Because when I said that I'm running as a progressive, those are my ideals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=666.895s">[Leming]</a>: And then you end up making a decision that maybe some person doesn't like, you kind of notice that there's a lot of folks in the city who will turn on you after that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=677.685s">[Leming]</a>: And that's happened<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=679.787s">[Leming]</a>: to me quite a few times with relationships that I've had with various folks around the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=686.672s">[Leming]</a>: I've noticed that Larry was one of the few people who truly did not matter to him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=695.817s">[Leming]</a>: There's a few other people like that where you could tell it's just whatever happens politically, whatever happens in the chambers, it just doesn't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=708.223s">[Leming]</a>: matter to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=710.144s">[Leming]</a>: They'll always value their relationship.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=712.725s">[Leming]</a>: They'll always value who you are as a human being above all of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=716.986s">[Leming]</a>: They really know how to remain neutral and respect the person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=724.829s">[Leming]</a>: And so it made me respect and miss him a lot more, even though I haven't known him as long as some of my colleagues had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=738.51s">[Leming]</a>: gave him a phone call, gave him a phone call over the summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=742.153s">[Leming]</a>: And after he'd been hospitalized, talked for a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=745.796s">[Leming]</a>: Remember, I just asked him about the history of the, you know, Medford politics, because we're having some contentious meetings here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=754.824s">[Leming]</a>: And he said to me, Matt, it's always been that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=762.256s">[Leming]</a>: So this was a guy who, he'd been around the block a few times, and he knew that at the end of the day, it's the person that matters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=770.484s">[Leming]</a>: It's none of this, all of this is ephemeral.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=773.547s">[Leming]</a>: So I miss him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=787.85s">[Leming]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=796.773s">[Leming]</a>: Speaking of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=801.114s">[Leming]</a>: As we were saying, we lost Councilor Collins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=804.236s">[Leming]</a>: She walks in the door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=811.127s">[Leming]</a>: Would we withdraw the motion so that we can allow for more discussion from the colleagues who just arrived?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=819.43s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1568.07s">[Leming]</a>: This is just to add on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1570.091s">[Leming]</a>: I fully agree that the cost of these facilities needs to be determined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1576.115s">[Leming]</a>: Probably also the very basic question of which parks and what would be an ideal number to shoot for across the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1585.762s">[Leming]</a>: How many of these facilities do we want to build?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1755.871s">[Leming]</a>: It's just a question for Councilor Tseng what resident when you're putting this forward, what resident complaints were you specifically responding to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1768.002s">[Leming]</a>: Was it folks that were visiting certain parks who wanted this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1773.066s">[Leming]</a>: What was, could you just talk a little bit about the feedback you were getting that led to this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1902.332s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1904.406s">[Leming]</a>: On that, I would motion to request feedback on the cost, potential cost savings and need for these sanitary facilities in public spaces around Medford from Tim McGivern and Alicia Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1933.11s">[Leming]</a>: as well as their recommendation, as well as their long-term recommendations on this problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1943.555s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, I was trying to think of a way to word it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1946.636s">[Leming]</a>: But essentially, given the resources, the intent of it is given the resources the city has now, how much do they think that their resources should be prioritized to implementing this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2091.004s">[Leming]</a>: I'm just unsure how that would be implemented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2092.845s">[Leming]</a>: Would it be an email to all city staff and then request a general request for feedback?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2177.833s">[Leming]</a>: new wording of the motion could be, and feel free to feel free to jump in if any of my more experienced colleagues have recommendations to edit it, but a motion to request feedback from department heads on the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2196.235s">[Leming]</a>: idea of installing permanent sanitary facilities in public spaces, including our parks, with the invitation to have one-on-one meetings with council members if they feel the need to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2211.705s">[Leming]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=123.015s">[Leming]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=161.63s">[Leming]</a>: All right, Justin, you on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=165.191s">[Leming]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=168.172s">[Leming]</a>: Cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=170.993s">[Leming]</a>: Ready?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=172.593s">[Leming]</a>: Do I have to do a roll call?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=182.697s">[Leming]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=185.618s">[Leming]</a>: No, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=187.363s">[Leming]</a>: All right, welcome to the meeting of the Medford Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=194.585s">[Leming]</a>: This is the first meeting that I've been in where we are testing out our new AV system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=201.667s">[Leming]</a>: So you might notice some technical difficulties going on with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=207.588s">[Leming]</a>: I believe what you do, Councilor Callahan-Lazzaro, is press the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=216.465s">[Leming]</a>: Yep, Kevin Harrington is kindly instructing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=235.694s">[Leming]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=237.154s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, if you want to, the way that this works is you put yourself in the queue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=243.675s">[Leming]</a>: And then when I put next on, that means that I can end up sort of choosing people in the order that they press their little mic button.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=250.617s">[Leming]</a>: So I could also try to make it so that we could all just talk at once, but I'm going to have to get used to these new controls here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=259.498s">[Leming]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=260.618s">[Leming]</a>: The first thing that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=263.599s">[Leming]</a>: We are going to go over this session is the draft of the Medford City Council newsletter for October 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=272.286s">[Leming]</a>: I ended up, I was the one who drafted this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=278.251s">[Leming]</a>: It essentially just goes over everything that we've covered in the past month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=286.018s">[Leming]</a>: I would like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=288.603s">[Leming]</a>: You know, I sent the meeting out, I sent the document out to all my colleagues prior to this, and just invited everybody to offer their comments as some folks are doing right now in this at the moment, like, even as we speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=310.643s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Tseng, I would like to also draw your attention just to the governance committee, as well as Councilors Lazar and Callahan to the committees that you chair, just to be sure that the descriptions that I wrote for those are accurate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=325.43s">[Leming]</a>: So if you have any thoughts or questions or ways that you think things should be edited, feel free to let me know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=341.187s">[Leming]</a>: Let's see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=346.609s">[Leming]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=361.774s">[Leming]</a>: Kevin, it says that her mic is on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=364.555s">[Leming]</a>: Hold on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=366.715s">[Leming]</a>: Here, but it's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=457.296s">[Leming]</a>: We're going to, let's, I understand that we're just, I just want to do, finish editing the newsletter and then we will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=477.87s">[Leming]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=479.791s">[Leming]</a>: So, all right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=480.552s">[Leming]</a>: So if councillors, that's reasonable enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=484.214s">[Leming]</a>: If councillors would like to spend a little bit of time editing it while we go through Councilor Tseng's presentation on the next agenda item, then feel free to do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=500.484s">[Leming]</a>: I understand that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=503.792s">[Leming]</a>: Due to some emails flying around, not everybody has been able to do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=507.615s">[Leming]</a>: But if Councilor Tseng would like to offer a brief presentation on the state, on the Human Rights Commission, then as he wants to, then he can go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=524.908s">[Leming]</a>: Then feel free to take it away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=590.626s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=592.507s">[Leming]</a>: So for the very brief update on the State of the Human Rights Commission, we will move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=603.711s">[Leming]</a>: Are there any other comments from Councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=607.653s">[Leming]</a>: Okay, we'll move on to public comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=611.574s">[Leming]</a>: I see Steve Schnapp's hand raised on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=615.075s">[Leming]</a>: I'm just gonna ask him to unmute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=633.456s">[Leming]</a>: No, no, go, go for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=635.038s">[Leming]</a>: Without that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=711.184s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=711.845s">[Leming]</a>: Is there any other public comment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=717.346s">[Leming]</a>: Anyone else who'd like to speak?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=719.067s">[Leming]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=724.709s">[Leming]</a>: Seeing none, do we have a motion on the floor regarding this paper?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=742.238s">[Leming]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=744.86s">[Leming]</a>: Motion by Councilor Lazzaro to keep the paper in committee, seconded by Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=752.686s">[Leming]</a>: Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=772.97s">[Leming]</a>: Yes, for an affirmative, none absent, the motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=780.932s">[Leming]</a>: Would also like to note for the AV folks that there might need to be a better system for roll call in the future as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=794.955s">[Leming]</a>: So it's just kind of because it's good<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=801.129s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, it's better to be able to do it quickly instead of have everybody queue up each and every time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=807.111s">[Leming]</a>: So there's kind of a note for the future with this new audio-visual system we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=812.893s">[Leming]</a>: But in any case, I'd like to thank everybody for attending for the brief update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=818.854s">[Leming]</a>: And I hope that we'll be able to have something public as soon as we can on the Human Rights Commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=828.51s">[Leming]</a>: Moving back to the newsletter draft, which we can hopefully hammer out and set a record for pretty fast committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=840.3s">[Leming]</a>: I'm just going to share that once again to Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=843.203s">[Leming]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=851.613s">[Leming]</a>: So it looks like we just have a couple of typos, which are entirely my fault.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=859.319s">[Leming]</a>: So I'm just going to go ahead and accept a few of these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=861.14s">[Leming]</a>: Let's see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=867.004s">[Leming]</a>: And if any Councilor has anything in particular that they'd like to point out in the newsletter or discuss, then just feel free to raise your hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=875.63s">[Leming]</a>: The Councilor is saying, I see that your hand is raised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=878.272s">[Leming]</a>: Is that from before?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=879.653s">[Leming]</a>: That was from before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=882.014s">[Leming]</a>: Okay, cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=926.1s">[Leming]</a>: The links I put there solely to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=930.882s">[Leming]</a>: The links I put there mainly to just help myself later when I go into latech and create it and format it myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=955.611s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=957.429s">[Leming]</a>: And I'm just going through this through and accepting Councilor Tseng's edits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=965.813s">[Leming]</a>: It's clear that Harvard Law student is much better at editing texts than a very tired scientist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=977.519s">[Leming]</a>: Unequally tired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=980.981s">[Leming]</a>: A very tired Harvard Law student is clearly better with the English language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1005.965s">[Leming]</a>: All right, that looks... Wait, Councilor Tseng, is this comment that I'm seeing here...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1039.295s">[Leming]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1054.094s">[Leming]</a>: Cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1058.575s">[Leming]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1059.216s">[Leming]</a>: And I understand that I was trying to remember that meeting following the four hours and 42 minute Q&A session, which of the resolutions from the October 15th meeting we tabled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1076.323s">[Leming]</a>: And I asked the clerk earlier, and he said that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1080.643s">[Leming]</a>: According to his memory, we did not table the commemoration of Sarah Bradley Fulton Day, but we did table the commemoration of the two DPW staff members who returned a lost wallet for the next regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1094.667s">[Leming]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1110.8s">[Leming]</a>: Um, at the commemorations and acknowledgement section, uh, we, I put the, I put the two, uh, commemorations from the October 15th meeting in there, but we tabled a couple of stuff really, really quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1124.506s">[Leming]</a>: And I was having trouble remembering exactly which ones we table and which ones we very quickly passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1129.628s">[Leming]</a>: So, um, I would, do you want me to run down and check?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1170.373s">[Leming]</a>: Can we just, how do we make these all just so that people can unmute themselves?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1173.996s">[Leming]</a>: How do we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1176.939s">[Leming]</a>: No, no, I mean, this is just a regular time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1199.898s">[Leming]</a>: So, in the, you know, in some of the earlier ones we might have accidentally left off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1206.403s">[Leming]</a>: a couple of them or not put all of them on there especially because the initial one was covering a four-month period and it was pretty lengthy as it was but um I think I think moving forward it's probably it would just be nice to show people um who and all was commemorated at these these different meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1227.978s">[Leming]</a>: Sorry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1236.952s">[Leming]</a>: When was that passed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1265.21s">[Leming]</a>: What date was Larry's passing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1269.073s">[Leming]</a>: Really?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1271.755s">[Leming]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1275.877s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1276.378s">[Leming]</a>: It's hard for me to find the records of the ones I can get the date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1288.786s">[Leming]</a>: Well, the date of the resolution would have been the 15th, but the date of his passing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1294.673s">[Leming]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1295.733s">[Leming]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1295.993s">[Leming]</a>: October 14.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1296.453s">[Leming]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1304.795s">[Leming]</a>: Does this seem like an appropriate addition?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1306.816s">[Leming]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1317.058s">[Leming]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1317.638s">[Leming]</a>: Do we have a motion on the floor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1324.4s">[Leming]</a>: Chairman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1327.281s">[Leming]</a>: Was that a second Councilor Tseng?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1347.806s">[Leming]</a>: I'm just going through and looking at it and accepting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1416.51s">[Leming]</a>: public vote in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1419.092s">[Leming]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1452.582s">[Leming]</a>: Motion by Councilor Callahan to approve and release.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1457.343s">[Leming]</a>: Do we have a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1459.184s">[Leming]</a>: Seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1461.825s">[Leming]</a>: Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, would you please call the roll?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1481.408s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1482.349s">[Leming]</a>: Four in the affirmative, one absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1484.43s">[Leming]</a>: The motion passes and we have another newsletter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1490.553s">[Leming]</a>: Do we have any other motions on the floor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1495.316s">[Leming]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1495.976s">[Leming]</a>: Seconded by?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1498.017s">[Leming]</a>: On the motion to adjourn by Councilor Lazzaro, seconded by Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1502.4s">[Leming]</a>: Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, would you please call the roll?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1521.514s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1521.934s">[Leming]</a>: For the affirmative one absent, the motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1524.616s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you everybody and have a wonderful evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4487.355s">[Leming]</a>: Just to add to that, so this actually came up at an event at a small house party where we were talking about these measures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4498.262s">[Leming]</a>: Somebody asked me, well, if you're proposing to put $500,000 towards the GDW for road repairs, I live on a private road, how would that affect me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4508.769s">[Leming]</a>: I had no idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4509.93s">[Leming]</a>: So I ended up emailing Tim McGibbon, CC, the fellow who asked me, and what Tim said was that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4517.715s">[Leming]</a>: there is no, so just by the fact, by the nature of it being private, there's no legal obligation for him to actively repair these roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4528.639s">[Leming]</a>: But he said that they, if, when they have capacity, they will do it anyway, just to keep the city nice, and putting a permanent road repair crew into being going will just give them,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4543.585s">[Leming]</a>: more capacity to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4545.526s">[Leming]</a>: So that was his perspective on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4549.128s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5257.263s">[Leming]</a>: That's correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5258.124s">[Leming]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5258.264s">[Leming]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3411.547s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3412.128s">[Leming]</a>: Just like to really quickly request that when, at the meeting when TDM is discussed specifically, I would appreciate some forewarning on that because I think it would be appropriate to invite the Lower Mystic TMA to that meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3427.601s">[Leming]</a>: They have been asking about it, so I'm not sure if there will be a specific meeting about that in itself or if it will just come up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3437.529s">[Leming]</a>: as a topic in future meetings, but in any case, I'm forewarning that you'll appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3477.388s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Lueb, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3482.092s">[Leming]</a>: Yes, I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3483.453s">[Leming]</a>: There are some folks from there that have been speaking with me, and they even previously met with City staff, but I think it would be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3498.084s">[Leming]</a>: wise to invite them to the planning meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3501.065s">[Leming]</a>: I mean, I can't go to them because of, obviously because of open meeting law considerations, but I know that just on some emails, their contact information is available and they previously met with me and Laurel Siegel, but that was a while ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=3520.012s">[Leming]</a>: So just having them be more included in the workflow, I think would be a good idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4443.443s">[Leming]</a>: There's no more public comment or input from staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4447.365s">[Leming]</a>: I wanted to make a motion to refer to a regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4461.532s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4604.464s">[Leming]</a>: Motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Jdzud93kkaU&t=4606.065s">[Leming]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1371.109s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1373.611s">[Leming]</a>: At this committee meeting, we heard a brief update from Councilor Tseng on the progress of the Human Rights Commission updates, and we drafted a newsletter which was subsequently released, and that's what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1391.446s">[Leming]</a>: I have a motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1449.576s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you, Council President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1450.777s">[Leming]</a>: I have a motion to suspend the rules and take public participation out of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2319.193s">[Leming]</a>: This is just a very brief comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2321.314s">[Leming]</a>: So I do definitely hear what Marianne is saying about during any construction phase, it's likely that parking would be unavailable during that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2328.877s">[Leming]</a>: But the RFP, just to really highlight this, the RFP does call for the construction of a parking garage in any developments that are created so long term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2342.144s">[Leming]</a>: ideally going by what the RFP says, this wouldn't affect parking availability in the area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2349.874s">[Leming]</a>: So that's the idea, but I just wanted to, again, I'm hearing what Marianne is saying about the temporary unavailability during construction, but I did want to highlight that for folks in the room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2358.404s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4430.53s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4432.791s">[Leming]</a>: So this is pretty much a cut and dry resolution which would adopt the two parts of the HERO Act that City Councils explicitly need to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4447.257s">[Leming]</a>: I've talked to the Veteran Services Director and the assessor<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4451.559s">[Leming]</a>: about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4452.161s">[Leming]</a>: So clause 22.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4458.815s">[Leming]</a>: that would allow for the city to go up to the full amount of exemptions for veterans, although we already do that in other parts of general laws, chapter 59.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4475.399s">[Leming]</a>: So it wouldn't necessarily add to that, but Ted tells me there's no harm in adopting it anyway, just for future purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4482.201s">[Leming]</a>: The real effect of that would be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4484.382s">[Leming]</a>: The real important part here is clause 22 I, which would basically increase the amount of folks tax exemptions on a yearly basis according to increases in the consumer price index.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4497.727s">[Leming]</a>: So it's another mechanism to make these kind of dollar amount exemptions automatic without a city council or the state having to come in and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4510.211s">[Leming]</a>: do that explicitly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4511.252s">[Leming]</a>: So that's one of the new things that the HERO Act allows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4515.877s">[Leming]</a>: So I yeah, it's a you know, it's a fairly straightforward adoption of provisions of state law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4526.086s">[Leming]</a>: And I would motion to send this to legal for review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4535.84s">[Leming]</a>: I talked it over with head he recommended to send it to legal for review first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4663.666s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4664.207s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, so this is, there's already, I mean, Ted's already seen the text of this and he approved everything, but I could add onto that motion just a request from the assessor for a memo, an additional memo to outline his approval for it in the public record if my colleagues think that that is appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4731.957s">[Leming]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4732.937s">[Leming]</a>: Sounds good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4733.378s">[Leming]</a>: So moved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1589.201s">[Leming]</a>: I'd also like to point out that people are confused about this because an organization that Councilor Scarpelli is in the leadership, I've sent people out an email saying that this was what was written in the ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1598.951s">[Leming]</a>: So if you send an email.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1619.0s">[Leming]</a>: I mean, you can't send an email out saying that this is what it's about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1635.769s">[Leming]</a>: You're causing confusion and saying there's confusion in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5240.038s">[Leming]</a>: Yes, thank you, Council President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5242.479s">[Leming]</a>: The only amendment to this that council advised was to remove the up to and up to 100% in the very last paragraph of the resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5255.425s">[Leming]</a>: but otherwise both council and the assessor thought that this was perfectly acceptable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5262.651s">[Leming]</a>: So I would motion to amend this to remove the two words up to in the very last paragraph and pass it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5740.162s">[Leming]</a>: No, I just wanted to clarify that in our correspondence that I had with Paul Raihee, he said that he did select the contractor already that will be doing this work, the same company that did historic renovations for Faneuil Hall in Boston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5755.932s">[Leming]</a>: So I don't know the name of that company specifically, but I had a back and forth with him about with him and some members of the CPA about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5764.257s">[Leming]</a>: So that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5765.828s">[Leming]</a>: already is selected as my okay so he did that already Yeah, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=416.664s">[Leming]</a>: know if he's going to be attending in person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=454.824s">[Leming]</a>: If they know if Scott's going to be attending building commissioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=487.722s">[Leming]</a>: My understanding was that he had some recommendations for changing some stuff about the green score to make it not conflict with the building code.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=501.548s">[Leming]</a>: But if we already have that written down somewhere so that it could be amended during the meeting, then that would be fine too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=525.072s">[Leming]</a>: Okay, okay, just as long as you see what's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=530.936s">[Leming]</a>: Adam, any word on when Councilor Scarpella is gonna show up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=537.392s">[Leming]</a>: Or did he give you any indication of that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=550.239s">[Leming]</a>: All right, let's do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=553.061s">[Leming]</a>: So welcome to the planning and permitting committee of November 13th, 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=561.141s">[Leming]</a>: During this meeting, we're just going to we are going to go over mainly the proposed green zone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=568.625s">[Leming]</a>: Green score zoning ordinance at the end of the meeting, we'll have a short presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=574.488s">[Leming]</a>: I mean, very short on the Salem street corridor, which is going to be coming up the next regular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=581.371s">[Leming]</a>: meeting of the City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=584.653s">[Leming]</a>: Just as a reminder, if you would like to be recognized and speak, please raise your hand on Zoom first and I'll recognize you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=597.122s">[Leming]</a>: But the goal of this meeting is to refer out the green score by the end of it for the regular City Council meeting next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=611.309s">[Leming]</a>: And with that being said, I will turn it over to Paola, unless any of my colleagues on city council have anything they'd like to say first, feel free to raise your hand really quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=625.306s">[Leming]</a>: Oh, Adam.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=637.077s">[Leming]</a>: Oh, okay, sorry, I thought that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=643.618s">[Leming]</a>: Okay, sorry, that was- That's okay, don't worry about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=646.558s">[Leming]</a>: Yep, yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=647.338s">[Leming]</a>: Don't worry about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=648.379s">[Leming]</a>: Go ahead, go ahead and take a roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=671.642s">[Leming]</a>: She is absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=677.127s">[Leming]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=680.99s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=681.351s">[Leming]</a>: So do any of my colleagues on City Council have anything they'd like to say first?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=690.519s">[Leming]</a>: No?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=691.491s">[Leming]</a>: All right, in that case, Paola, take it away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=722.102s">[Leming]</a>: Are you able to share?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1133.963s">[Leming]</a>: I think he's a reminder it's generally it's generally only acceptable if the chair recognizes folks from the floor, but go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1247.009s">[Leming]</a>: Oh, Councilor Council President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1289.765s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1292.686s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1296.394s">[Leming]</a>: that's on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1405.508s">[Leming]</a>: We don't see the Excel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1406.409s">[Leming]</a>: Oh, yep, now we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1407.61s">[Leming]</a>: I see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1749.637s">[Leming]</a>: If there are any questions, feel free to raise your hand on Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1754.66s">[Leming]</a>: Director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1840.694s">[Leming]</a>: Any other questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1843.636s">[Leming]</a>: All right, continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1844.677s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1966.011s">[Leming]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1966.391s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1966.751s">[Leming]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1971.451s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1971.893s">[Leming]</a>: Keep going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2107.467s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2113.568s">[Leming]</a>: Any other input from anybody else on the call?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2126.191s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2143.116s">[Leming]</a>: Mr. Commissioner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2147.478s">[Leming]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2150.236s">[Leming]</a>: I just ask you to unmute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2151.838s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2187.873s">[Leming]</a>: Director Hunt?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2191.917s">[Leming]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2192.738s">[Leming]</a>: I might have mistaken that pause as a... No, no, it's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2200.867s">[Leming]</a>: Director Hunt?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2408.101s">[Leming]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2557.227s">[Leming]</a>: Personally, I'm thinking that a lot of these points can be, I mean, a lot of these do seem to be relatively minor changes at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2573.462s">[Leming]</a>: And, sorry, I was looking at Zach to see if, and I think that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2585.182s">[Leming]</a>: This is likely subject to the building commissioner's previous changes that he recommended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2592.605s">[Leming]</a>: This is still likely able to be referred to regular council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2599.068s">[Leming]</a>: And if the Planning Department and the building commissioner do come up with any recommendations over the next week, we could incorporate those during a regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2624.682s">[Leming]</a>: So with that, is there any further discussion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2633.317s">[Leming]</a>: you know, I do think like these are important technical points, but they can also be done between the consultants and the staff and sort of hammered out during some of the, during some longer meetings between individuals and recommended to the council or the CD board later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2654.707s">[Leming]</a>: With that, is there any other comments from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2660.931s">[Leming]</a>: staff or city councilors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2668.576s">[Leming]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2671.017s">[Leming]</a>: Do we have any motions on the floor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2682.184s">[Leming]</a>: I'm aware of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2684.285s">[Leming]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2685.886s">[Leming]</a>: I'll get to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2687.147s">[Leming]</a>: I'll get to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2695.488s">[Leming]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2695.968s">[Leming]</a>: Motion to refer out to the regular meeting pending discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2698.67s">[Leming]</a>: And I did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2699.731s">[Leming]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2704.696s">[Leming]</a>: Do we have a second on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2708.305s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2709.306s">[Leming]</a>: And with that, I do see that Mr. Fiore's hand is raised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2713.551s">[Leming]</a>: So we will move to public comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2716.875s">[Leming]</a>: Just to check, because this was a little bit unclear, like it was kind of a last minute switch to Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2723.122s">[Leming]</a>: President Bears or Councilor Callahan, can you verify that there is, is there anybody physically in the audience at the hall right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2730.114s">[Leming]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2730.914s">[Leming]</a>: Okay, in that case, we'll move on to public comment and I'm going to ask Mr. Fiore to unmute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2741.28s">[Leming]</a>: Mr. Fiore, if you'd be able to provide your name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2888.859s">[Leming]</a>: I was taking notes on what you just said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2890.701s">[Leming]</a>: So you're wondering if the effects of irrigation on green roofs, zoning related to tree height and their ability to affect solar panels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2899.192s">[Leming]</a>: And could you just rephrase your first question again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2941.843s">[Leming]</a>: Okay, so inclusion of cool, is there inclusion of cool roofs in the green score inclusion of the effects of irrigation on green roofs or anything about that zoning related to tall trees?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2953.231s">[Leming]</a>: I do know that there is some work being done with regards to the tree that there is some work being done on the tree ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2961.617s">[Leming]</a>: I think that was, that's primarily Councilor Collins and Councilor Callahan who are doing or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2970.783s">[Leming]</a>: spearheading a lot of the work on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2974.484s">[Leming]</a>: If Councilor Cowlin, if you have any information related to trees, feel free to raise your hand, but otherwise, otherwise, Paola, can you confirm whether or not there's anything related to cool roofs or anything related to irrigation on green roofs in the current draft?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3144.801s">[Leming]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3145.901s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you, Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3146.601s">[Leming]</a>: I think that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3147.802s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3148.142s">[Leming]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3149.602s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3151.069s">[Leming]</a>: All right, and not seeing any other folks here for public comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3156.311s">[Leming]</a>: So Council President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3182.565s">[Leming]</a>: I also emailed it to Mr. Feuer during his public comment, so I feel like we just really rushed to get those documents all at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3192.795s">[Leming]</a>: So there is a, there's, Director Hunt?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3233.705s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3235.426s">[Leming]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3237.207s">[Leming]</a>: We have a motion on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3241.489s">[Leming]</a>: Mr. Clerk, can you please call the roll?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3246.712s">[Leming]</a>: Do you have the exact text of the motion, by the way?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3292.873s">[Leming]</a>: Yes or yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3295.735s">[Leming]</a>: One absent the motion passes the chair is referred out to regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3304.347s">[Leming]</a>: And the other item on the agenda is just a quick, very quick update on the Salem Street corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3310.972s">[Leming]</a>: Is that, Paola, as well, you had that update?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3391.846s">[Leming]</a>: Wonderful, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3394.609s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3547.754s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3549.655s">[Leming]</a>: Council President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3644.985s">[Leming]</a>: Well, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3645.705s">[Leming]</a>: We, we went over ground rules at the beginning, raise, raise hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3648.446s">[Leming]</a>: And then, uh, and then, and I saw that, uh, director hunt raised her hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3654.769s">[Leming]</a>: And so then I'll, uh, did you have, um, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3660.611s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3701.896s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3702.236s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli, director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3834.901s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you, Director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3836.222s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3971.455s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Scapelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3972.996s">[Leming]</a>: Do we have any motions on the floor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3985.129s">[Leming]</a>: Sure, yeah, let's go into public participation for this item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3993.294s">[Leming]</a>: Mr. Fiore?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4076.51s">[Leming]</a>: Well, the city does have a number of folks who volunteer in certain service that usually they're on boards or those sorts of volunteer positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4091.694s">[Leming]</a>: So I was on the CPA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4094.675s">[Leming]</a>: So the city does utilize volunteers for a lot of different tasks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4100.457s">[Leming]</a>: I don't know if we've utilized them for that one specifically, but Council President Bears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4150.525s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, no, the community liaisons I think is a very good point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4154.108s">[Leming]</a>: So those are folks that are probably most similar to what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4159.761s">[Leming]</a>: Mr. Fiora was just talking about, but you're right in terms of just strictly location-based.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4165.286s">[Leming]</a>: I'm not sure if we have one of those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4167.267s">[Leming]</a>: Paola.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4253.99s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4254.611s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you, Paula.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4257.481s">[Leming]</a>: So with that, unless someone else has entered the city hall physically, I'm not seeing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4266.145s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, not seeing any other folks who'd like to do public participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4273.067s">[Leming]</a>: So we'll close that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4275.948s">[Leming]</a>: And with that, do we have any motions on the floor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4279.55s">[Leming]</a>: Motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4280.95s">[Leming]</a>: We have a second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4288.134s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4289.795s">[Leming]</a>: On the motion to adjourn by Council President Bears, seconded by Councilor Callahan, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4299.683s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4308.771s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4309.852s">[Leming]</a>: Four in the affirmative, one absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4311.593s">[Leming]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4312.294s">[Leming]</a>: The meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4313.235s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you very much for coming out tonight, everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=413.531s">[Leming]</a>: started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=414.172s">[Leming]</a>: Welcome to the meeting of the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=424.303s">[Leming]</a>: We have three items on the agenda tonight, and we're going to take them a little bit out of order and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=433.138s">[Leming]</a>: start by looking at the resolution to allow the director of veteran services to offer housing incentives to veteran renters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=443.947s">[Leming]</a>: We're joined here today by Teresa DuPont and Veronica Shaw to offer a bit of a recap of where this was at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=454.836s">[Leming]</a>: This was an idea that veteran services director Shaw had in which<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=460.945s">[Leming]</a>: she would have the ability to use extra funds that were allocated to the veteran's office to essentially have a voucher program for veteran renters so that landlords could get an extra bonus if they choose to rent out to veterans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=478.093s">[Leming]</a>: We passed this by legal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=479.354s">[Leming]</a>: It was found that it would have complications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=482.035s">[Leming]</a>: There are complications in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=485.173s">[Leming]</a>: letting the city distribute money directly to people to interested parties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=490.837s">[Leming]</a>: We would have to and Council told us that we would have to first go to a nonprofit and that led to a partnership that was largely initiated by the city staff with housing families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=506.607s">[Leming]</a>: We have a memo here<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=509.315s">[Leming]</a>: that housing families pass to us, which describes the outline of this program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=517.121s">[Leming]</a>: And because it was not, I don't believe we only got this memo yesterday, so it wasn't distributed in the official agenda packet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=525.847s">[Leming]</a>: So it's fairly, so I'm just going to read it into the public record real quick, and then I'll let Teresa and Veronica speak about it and answer any questions that we might have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=539.498s">[Leming]</a>: The memo from housing families as follows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=541.9s">[Leming]</a>: As a longtime community resource partner of the city of Method, housing families help support the Medford community by providing homelessness prevention and housing services to income eligible residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=552.627s">[Leming]</a>: Recently, housing families was approached by the city of Method's veteran service director, Veronica Shaw, city councilor and city councilor Matt Leming to propose a new partnership and a pilot veterans housing assistance program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=562.854s">[Leming]</a>: The program would provide a rebate incentive to property owners in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=566.877s">[Leming]</a>: who lease their units to residents identifying themselves as active or retired service people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=570.32s">[Leming]</a>: This program aligns with both the City of Medford and Housing Families' missions of providing housing assistance to residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=576.024s">[Leming]</a>: The City of Medford has already identified a funding source through the Veterans Services Office's general operating budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=581.128s">[Leming]</a>: This funding is required to be dispersed through an intermediary organization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=584.39s">[Leming]</a>: Housing Families is uniquely qualified to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=588.257s">[Leming]</a>: support this program as our organization currently supports several assistance programs for Medford in the greater Boston area and are located locally in Malden.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=598.122s">[Leming]</a>: The intended program eligibility guidelines will be as follows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=601.363s">[Leming]</a>: One head of household must be an active or retired service member as defined by Mass General Law Chapter 115.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=607.506s">[Leming]</a>: Property must be owner occupied by resident of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=611.188s">[Leming]</a>: Three, proper documentation must be submitted to verify eligibility, including but not limited to an executed lease agreement, verification of address, copy of active service documentation, or certificate of discharge as allowable by Mass General Law, Chapter 115, Section 3A, and the completed W-9 from the recipient or property owner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=630.573s">[Leming]</a>: Four, program payments will be distributed in the form of a paper check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=635.135s">[Leming]</a>: Five,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=636.275s">[Leming]</a>: property owners must apply for annual recertification to qualify for subsequent payments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=641.397s">[Leming]</a>: Six applications will be received on a first come, first served and rolling basis until program funds are extinguished.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=647.959s">[Leming]</a>: Seven, any remaining funds after the annual cycles will be rolled forward to provide funding for future applicants of this program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=655.541s">[Leming]</a>: Uh we ask that the city council offer their support of this program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=659.382s">[Leming]</a>: Best regards, Chief Executive Officer, Housing Families<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=666.423s">[Leming]</a>: further questions from my colleagues, I'll go ahead and hand it over to Teresa Dupont and Veronica Shaw so that they can speak about this and answer any questions that we might have about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=679.112s">[Leming]</a>: I see, Councilor, hold on, I still need to get used to leave you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=685.357s">[Leming]</a>: Okay, I don't think it's on the weird.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=687.138s">[Leming]</a>: I actually can't see your light.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=688.719s">[Leming]</a>: It's sort of blocked by the other light.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=691.341s">[Leming]</a>: No, I mean, literally, the lamp is blocking the red thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=693.723s">[Leming]</a>: So I can't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=695.137s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=695.937s">[Leming]</a>: OK, go ahead and press it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=699.98s">[Leming]</a>: Can you press it again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=701.501s">[Leming]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=703.342s">[Leming]</a>: What?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=704.542s">[Leming]</a>: This is weird.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=705.623s">[Leming]</a>: OK, now I'm seeing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=706.443s">[Leming]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=708.684s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=712.306s">[Leming]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=713.847s">[Leming]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=713.947s">[Leming]</a>: Aha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=726.575s">[Leming]</a>: Yes, it was distributed by the clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=728.756s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=737.983s">[Leming]</a>: It should be, I distributed it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=747.389s">[Leming]</a>: News, hold on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=759.612s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, it should have been.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=761.792s">[Leming]</a>: I am searching through my email.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=774.673s">[Leming]</a>: Documents for committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=776.074s">[Leming]</a>: It was sent to your Gmail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=782.517s">[Leming]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=783.757s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=784.277s">[Leming]</a>: I'm looking at it right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=795.102s">[Leming]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=795.362s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, so the documents for committee meeting, it should have both a copy of the Google<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=803.019s">[Leming]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=804.62s">[Leming]</a>: Pending any further questions, go ahead and press the button on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=809.502s">[Leming]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=812.444s">[Leming]</a>: Try speaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=911.86s">[Leming]</a>: pressing the next on button.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=913.402s">[Leming]</a>: I think you're can you hear me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1293.583s">[Leming]</a>: Actually, so I could, I could talk about that a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1296.666s">[Leming]</a>: So with regards to the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1298.308s">[Leming]</a>: ordinance change, the paper in front of you is the proposed language that originally was referred to this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1305.472s">[Leming]</a>: And I was planning on talking about that a little bit after the presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1310.375s">[Leming]</a>: So we would have to refer that to legal so that council can say what is the best way to frame this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1318.2s">[Leming]</a>: I do have some proposed language and if they<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1322.362s">[Leming]</a>: folks have any more input on sort of the maximum amount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1326.024s">[Leming]</a>: That's also very, you know, we can be amenable to that at this stage as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1330.587s">[Leming]</a>: But what you have in front of you is just the previous paper version of this paper that was referred to committee that most definitely will have to be changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1757.176s">[Leming]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1758.657s">[Leming]</a>: Any other comments?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1785.748s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Callahan, wait.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1789.089s">[Leming]</a>: Next on, I keep pressing the next on, I'm not sure what, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1794.752s">[Leming]</a>: Mic on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1832.993s">[Leming]</a>: All right, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1834.214s">[Leming]</a>: So with just a couple of logistical things related to this, I'm going to share my screen really quick here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1843.019s">[Leming]</a>: All right, so in order to do this, what you have in front of you is an additional authority added under the Director of Veterans Services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1861.62s">[Leming]</a>: The draft language was what I originally penned under the assumption that the veteran service director could do this independently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1870.984s">[Leming]</a>: Obviously, they cannot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1873.345s">[Leming]</a>: And so what I would propose is to replace that language with the following, which says the director of veteran services shall at their discretion and his funds are available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1883.889s">[Leming]</a>: have the authority to partner with a nonprofit organization which may offer cash incentives of up to $750 annually to landlords who offer rental housing to veterans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1892.096s">[Leming]</a>: I think that the best way forward is to first discuss this language, pass it to legal counsel, and then simultaneously pass this package to the regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1908.39s">[Leming]</a>: to a regular council meeting, and then once we have feedback from legal, revise the language there in accordance with whatever the recommendations might be, if they have any better way to phrase this than what I came up with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1922.817s">[Leming]</a>: Oh, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1950.571s">[Leming]</a>: We could potentially move it to the fee schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1954.832s">[Leming]</a>: That could be a solution to it so that it is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1962.587s">[Leming]</a>: updated automatically, that could be one solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1970.373s">[Leming]</a>: But I think that either way, this language is going to have to go by council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1976.379s">[Leming]</a>: And so I am comfortable referring this to a regular council meeting and then doing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1984.483s">[Leming]</a>: a little bit more research and potentially revising this to go into the fee schedule, for instance, and then voting on it there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1996.67s">[Leming]</a>: Council Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2006.598s">[Leming]</a>: That being said, do we have a motion on the floor to refer this to regular council and legal?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2018.24s">[Leming]</a>: On the motion by Councilor Callahan, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2022.841s">[Leming]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2023.721s">[Leming]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2024.682s">[Leming]</a>: All those opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2025.962s">[Leming]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2028.302s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you both very much for your work on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2033.61s">[Leming]</a>: And we will likely be looking at it at the next regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2041.415s">[Leming]</a>: Moving on, the city council newsletter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2044.717s">[Leming]</a>: I apologize for the last minute nature that we've been sending these things out at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2054.503s">[Leming]</a>: We're sort of doing a rotating schedule whereby different councillors<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2059.298s">[Leming]</a>: draft different portions of the newsletter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2062.139s">[Leming]</a>: But in that latest email, you should have a link to this Google Doc here, which contains the draft of Councilor Collins, as well as a couple of points that I added from late October, which events that occurred after our last meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2084.283s">[Leming]</a>: Now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2086.994s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Collins version of the newsletter actually does contain a couple of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2094.761s">[Leming]</a>: points that we are going to discuss in the meeting literally right after this, which I don't think has been done in a newsletter previously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2107.349s">[Leming]</a>: So I do think that news, personally, that newsletters should report things that have already happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2118.537s">[Leming]</a>: But one way to get around this is to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2124.859s">[Leming]</a>: potentially approve this language contingent on what happens in the next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2130.722s">[Leming]</a>: And then if we do, in fact, pass those, I could, with the permission of this committee, while formatting the newsletter, just change everything to the past tense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2139.266s">[Leming]</a>: Because when we're reporting things out, I think I would rather have more current events happen instead of waiting a month before we tell people what happened in a committee meeting that's happening today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2154.508s">[Leming]</a>: So that could be one way to write this, even though, technically, we're, as of this moment, the things discussed in this newsletter haven't happened yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2167.139s">[Leming]</a>: But that being said, Councilor Callahan, I can see that your mic is still on, so I'm not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2177.665s">[Leming]</a>: Okay, cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2179.947s">[Leming]</a>: Um, do we have any other specific suggestions to the content of the newsletter as it stands in this this Google document?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2189.917s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Tseng?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2226.228s">[Leming]</a>: That's very reasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2228.953s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2241.478s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, that's from my draft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2243.518s">[Leming]</a>: So I just keep those there for consistency's sake, but those wouldn't be in the formatted version.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2248.7s">[Leming]</a>: I could even just delete those now for clarity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2257.947s">[Leming]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2258.187s">[Leming]</a>: Do we have any other comments?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2264.45s">[Leming]</a>: Give folks a moment to go through it before we take any motions on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2279.777s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2287.104s">[Leming]</a>: No, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2287.684s">[Leming]</a>: So I think I think in this case, the motion would be specifically to approve it contingent upon the what is voted on in the next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2307.12s">[Leming]</a>: On the motion by Councilor Lazzaro, seconded by<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2310.558s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2312.299s">[Leming]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2314.261s">[Leming]</a>: All those opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2316.383s">[Leming]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2318.705s">[Leming]</a>: And the very last item on the agenda is just a brief update on what's going on with the City Council listening sessions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2331.366s">[Leming]</a>: So I know that there has been a little bit of behind the scenes activity, mainly because these listening sessions just require Councilors kind of running around and trying to coordinate with different groups, get something on the calendar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2343.611s">[Leming]</a>: But I'm just going to go ahead and give the opportunity to Councilors Lazzaro and Callahan, who I know have been working on some of these initiatives as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2353.236s">[Leming]</a>: So whoever would like to go first, Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2432.982s">[Leming]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2433.483s">[Leming]</a>: Wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2437.387s">[Leming]</a>: Council call him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2532.196s">[Leming]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2535.378s">[Leming]</a>: Well, I am very, very glad to hear that these, these issues are happening and we are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2544.52s">[Leming]</a>: actively reaching out to members of the community that, again, like you're saying, normally do not come into these chambers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2553.146s">[Leming]</a>: And I'm looking forward to the reports of the listening sessions that have happened and just a brief outline of some of the feedback that we've gotten there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2566.735s">[Leming]</a>: Just, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2568.156s">[Leming]</a>: So thank you all very much for your wonderful work on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2572.919s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2576.869s">[Leming]</a>: it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2594.173s">[Leming]</a>: All right, so the one for the Arab.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2620.038s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2667.13s">[Leming]</a>: Great, I don't think we, do we necessarily have to take a vote on that one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2672.311s">[Leming]</a>: No, yeah, okay, cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2675.592s">[Leming]</a>: All right, great, sounds good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2687.055s">[Leming]</a>: Wonderful, all right, is there, all right, is there any public participation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2691.856s">[Leming]</a>: I'm not seeing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2695.629s">[Leming]</a>: Anybody bite on zoom or in the chambers, see that Teresa's knitting over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2702.851s">[Leming]</a>: So, oh, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2755.778s">[Leming]</a>: I feel like accessing these groups is sometimes it's a matter of personal connections and trying to communicate with folks who you know might have those connections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2769.105s">[Leming]</a>: I know a couple of parents who might be able to tap into their parental networks to figure that particular one out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2782.907s">[Leming]</a>: So that could be one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2784.868s">[Leming]</a>: I mean, that could be something to pursue in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2789.451s">[Leming]</a>: In terms of students, because that was another one on our list, my thoughts on that would be you'd really have to get more formal, sort of a more formal,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2803.258s">[Leming]</a>: lines for that, like probably reaching out to the principal of Medford High to see if they're okay with it, or reaching out to student government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2813.924s">[Leming]</a>: So in that case, I would imagine that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2819.736s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, in that case, you definitely need to have a slightly more formal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2825.521s">[Leming]</a>: And then there's also just different community centers and social centers around the city, which is where the senior center idea comes from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2836.11s">[Leming]</a>: I know I was thinking through reaching out to groups of veterans, in which case the VFW would be a good solution for that, a good way to address that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2848.066s">[Leming]</a>: But yeah, I also think that we did kind of have a bit of a lull in scheduling these listening sessions over the summer because when we were scheduling our ambitious schedule, we didn't understand that it was the summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2861.24s">[Leming]</a>: And nobody was really around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2863.102s">[Leming]</a>: So that's just something that happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2866.305s">[Leming]</a>: But I'm glad to see that they're picking up now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2869.148s">[Leming]</a>: And I think that, you know, when Councilor Lazzaro and I were brainstorming, we're like thinking of the regular sessions at the senior center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2876.335s">[Leming]</a>: The logic behind that was that it is an easy kind of like it is an easy month by month thing where we can put as little brain power as possible into reaching out and scheduling to a new group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2887.625s">[Leming]</a>: So that's just a way to sort of keep it going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2890.207s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2940.701s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2941.001s">[Leming]</a>: Do we have any motions on the floor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2945.082s">[Leming]</a>: Do we have a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2948.283s">[Leming]</a>: On the motion to adjourn by Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2952.044s">[Leming]</a>: That was Councilor Tseng, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2953.385s">[Leming]</a>: Okay, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2955.425s">[Leming]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2956.146s">[Leming]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2956.786s">[Leming]</a>: All those opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2957.766s">[Leming]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2958.546s">[Leming]</a>: Meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2959.347s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you, everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4571.194s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4668.143s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=4717.724s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fYmm4ApgnRY&t=5740.662s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=295.891s">[Leming]</a>: Justin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=297.552s">[Leming]</a>: Justin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=299.633s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=301.954s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Tseng, come on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=313.582s">[Leming]</a>: Is it in a mode where everybody can just turn on their own, or do I need to approve it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=321.186s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=322.187s">[Leming]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=322.347s">[Leming]</a>: Apparently not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=326.488s">[Leming]</a>: I'm trying to figure out how to, okay, wait, what do I need to press before we start the meeting too?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=333.192s">[Leming]</a>: What?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=333.873s">[Leming]</a>: No, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=336.674s">[Leming]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=340.217s">[Leming]</a>: Can you move it so that I can see if it's green?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=343.539s">[Leming]</a>: All right, and.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=350.103s">[Leming]</a>: All right, now it's on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=374.451s">[Leming]</a>: pull up the agenda real quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=378.734s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=379.034s">[Leming]</a>: All right, I think we can get started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=391.904s">[Leming]</a>: Welcome to the meeting of the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=397.868s">[Leming]</a>: I don't believe we need to take a roll call for attendance because nobody is on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=402.83s">[Leming]</a>: Zoom right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=404.671s">[Leming]</a>: The first paper that we will be considering tonight is 23055, offered by Councilor Tseng, a resolution to consider the welcoming city ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=416.575s">[Leming]</a>: This was actually, this was an ordinance that was actually offered in one of the predecessor committees last year by my colleague, essentially,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=430.5s">[Leming]</a>: It is an ordinance that officially codifies a policy of non-cooperation with federal authorities, specifically ICE on non-criminal matters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=443.105s">[Leming]</a>: Prior to this, I requested feedback from both the school committee, because it does contain some provisions relevant to the Medford public school system, as well as Chief Buckley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=456.17s">[Leming]</a>: I did hear some<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=457.864s">[Leming]</a>: Some pieces of feedback from members of the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=463.286s">[Leming]</a>: So there were some concerns with the bargaining sessions, the bargaining sections with the police, as well as the potential enforceability within the Medford public school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=478.433s">[Leming]</a>: But essentially, most members of the school committee did approve the current draft that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=487.764s">[Leming]</a>: as it was written.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=488.644s">[Leming]</a>: There is one issue with the ordinance, which is that the section numbers I outlined in this draft, and I'm just gonna share my screen really quickly to show everybody, were actually conflict with the CCOPS ordinance that will be considered tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=509.311s">[Leming]</a>: So I have here a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=513.775s">[Leming]</a>: version of it where I changed the section titles to fit into the municipal code a little bit better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=522.486s">[Leming]</a>: But other than that, I don't really see too many issues with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=528.634s">[Leming]</a>: I will<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=529.929s">[Leming]</a>: go ahead and let Councilor Tseng speak on this, then my colleagues, if they would like to add anything, and then we can move on to a public comment period, if folks have anything to offer on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=546.166s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Tseng, I'm going to turn your microphone on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=805.697s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=910.494s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you and I would also like to thank the many<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=914.474s">[Leming]</a>: folks in the activist community who put pressure on the Medford City Council to get this in front of us today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=923.483s">[Leming]</a>: I think it's a very particularly timely ordinance, much more so than we typically see in city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=931.671s">[Leming]</a>: So I'm excited to see it pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=935.174s">[Leming]</a>: We'll move on to public comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=938.057s">[Leming]</a>: So if you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=939.537s">[Leming]</a>: If anybody in the room has anything they'd like to say, either in person or on Zoom, please feel free to raise your hand on Zoom or line up at the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=953.506s">[Leming]</a>: And we would love to hear you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=958.57s">[Leming]</a>: Go ahead and press the thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=960.371s">[Leming]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=960.851s">[Leming]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=962.728s">[Leming]</a>: Now I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=963.148s">[Leming]</a>: Name and address for the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=1162.521s">[Leming]</a>: Hi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=1692.073s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you very much for your words.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=1694.977s">[Leming]</a>: Wendy, I see one hand on zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2564.759s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2623.093s">[Leming]</a>: Can you point out the word first that was misspelled?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2637.4s">[Leming]</a>: Oh, yep, yep, yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2638.801s">[Leming]</a>: I see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2641.042s">[Leming]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2641.402s">[Leming]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2642.683s">[Leming]</a>: I have my little copy right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2650.426s">[Leming]</a>: And for legal questions, I know we did bring Miss Rodolo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2655.488s">[Leming]</a>: Is she still here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2659.67s">[Leming]</a>: Just this is our representative from who works with the ACLU who agreed to come along to answer any of the more nitty gritty questions about the by the ordinance draft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2674.078s">[Leming]</a>: Sorry, can you can you repeat?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2747.733s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2748.789s">[Leming]</a>: My impression in speaking with folks at Medford People Power is that this is all fairly boilerplate language that has been replicated in other cities as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2764.474s">[Leming]</a>: Did you have anything?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2829.068s">[Leming]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2831.129s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, I think I think a report of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2834.468s">[Leming]</a>: There is no update is also fine as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2838.357s">[Leming]</a>: But noted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2840.742s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2925.365s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2926.306s">[Leming]</a>: So I could answer one part of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2930.148s">[Leming]</a>: I have been told nicer, and I did a little bit of research on similar ordinances that have been passed in other cities at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2940.133s">[Leming]</a>: Yes, the language is fairly boilerplate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2944.015s">[Leming]</a>: I did pass this by the mayor, who then referred it to KP Law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2949.818s">[Leming]</a>: So I think that any and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2953.26s">[Leming]</a>: My impression with that is that any specific legalese or whichever could very likely and pretty easily be dealt with in a regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2962.462s">[Leming]</a>: So yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2966.684s">[Leming]</a>: But in terms of the context for other cities, I would like to let Laura here speak about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2977.166s">[Leming]</a>: Go ahead and press the button.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2982.526s">[Leming]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=2983.526s">[Leming]</a>: It's a new system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3064.313s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3064.954s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3065.574s">[Leming]</a>: Does that answer all your?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3067.697s">[Leming]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3070.08s">[Leming]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3071.282s">[Leming]</a>: Any other comments?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3075.475s">[Leming]</a>: Do we have a motion on the floor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3079.897s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Tang?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3094.824s">[Leming]</a>: Yes, as well as the edit so kindly pointed out by my colleague about the small typo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3102.907s">[Leming]</a>: And that edit as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3106.67s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3107.33s">[Leming]</a>: There's always something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3110.572s">[Leming]</a>: On the motion to refer this to regular council pending the section edits and the typo, all those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3123.799s">[Leming]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3125.74s">[Leming]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3126.36s">[Leming]</a>: No one's on the same, so we could just do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3128.281s">[Leming]</a>: It doesn't have to be rolled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3129.002s">[Leming]</a>: It does not have to be rolled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3134.298s">[Leming]</a>: All opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3135.758s">[Leming]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3138.359s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you, everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3139.68s">[Leming]</a>: So, this... So, we'll be taking this up at a future regular meeting of the City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3151.563s">[Leming]</a>: We'll likely have more discussions there, but it's out of committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3157.485s">[Leming]</a>: Now, for the real reason everybody's here, we're gonna edit the newsletter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3163.769s">[Leming]</a>: I know that y'all been waiting so patiently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3166.912s">[Leming]</a>: Come on, come on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3169.675s">[Leming]</a>: We're gonna go out of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3172.377s">[Leming]</a>: I just wanna get this done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3223.078s">[Leming]</a>: One moment, City Council newsletters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3285.67s">[Leming]</a>: 2, 4, 3, 5, 4, the resolution to publish this city council newsletter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3295.899s">[Leming]</a>: I'd like to thank Councilor Tseng for drafting this particular issue of the newsletter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3304.105s">[Leming]</a>: We had, and do apologize that it was only sent out in the, wait,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3315.115s">[Leming]</a>: Why that's there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3316.057s">[Leming]</a>: That was only sent out in the middle of the day, but essentially the only real difference between this newsletter and previous ones is that they're first there is some.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3329.484s">[Leming]</a>: There is some tentative language on it, which we did last time, like keeping the future tense as well as the past tense and just kind of letting me edit that later when we go into review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3342.371s">[Leming]</a>: And there's also a nice little point by point breakdown because this is the end of year newsletter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3349.008s">[Leming]</a>: the holiday edition of the most significant accomplishments of city council this year, which would be something nice to discuss as to whether we want to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3362.978s">[Leming]</a>: Bye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3364.799s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you all for showing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3368.642s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3370.623s">[Leming]</a>: So essentially, the first bullet point goes over the override<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3378.035s">[Leming]</a>: The second discusses progress on zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3382.261s">[Leming]</a>: The third bullet point talks about the establishment of the stabilization funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3391.149s">[Leming]</a>: Then the policies to fund the affordable housing trust as well as tax deferrals and the proposed rental assistance program for veterans, communications methods, wildlife feeding ordinance, and the solid waste ordinance, and the leaf blower ordinance, environmental, as well as the upcoming work on the charter committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3416.858s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Callahan, if you can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3420.839s">[Leming]</a>: Yep, Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3428.662s">[Leming]</a>: I believe that's referring to the HERO Act one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3445.27s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, I think I think I put it broadly because I think we re maximize it for seniors, and then we did the time for that that's, that's a really tricky one but I had an in depth discussion with the with Tim cost with Ted cost and about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3464.645s">[Leming]</a>: We so technically passing one of the provisions of the Hero Act that we did pass was actually redundant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3471.431s">[Leming]</a>: And so it didn't like it didn't add up to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3474.014s">[Leming]</a>: So if we hadn't already maximized deferrals for seniors, it would have maximized them itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3479.119s">[Leming]</a>: But because we already had done that, it's like it didn't really, he said that there was some utility and actually passing it because then we could go on like a list of cities that had passed it and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3489.328s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, but he said, but the more important one was the fact that we tied it was the fact that we end up tying it to inflation to an inflation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3496.93s">[Leming]</a>: So the deferrals would go up every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3498.971s">[Leming]</a>: And I think that's, that's, that's the important part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3514.777s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, I am also disinclined from like putting out a very detailed legislative explanation of consumer price indexes and whatnot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3526.587s">[Leming]</a>: But I think it, I think it captures<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3547.598s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, it's it is it is a good thing that it was passed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3551.481s">[Leming]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3552.762s">[Leming]</a>: And I guess my other thing is that some of these are sort of what we will do future work, the veterans rental assistance program is not technically passed yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3566.353s">[Leming]</a>: But I mean, I think it's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3568.234s">[Leming]</a>: We have been working on these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3569.575s">[Leming]</a>: And I would say that these are the main bullet points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3573.338s">[Leming]</a>: And then the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3575.077s">[Leming]</a>: normal, the kind of general business of what actually happened in December is here as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3584.369s">[Leming]</a>: So yeah, pending the tenses here,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3593.638s">[Leming]</a>: Does anybody have any particular suggestions about things that should be changed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3598.98s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3646.178s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3703.905s">[Leming]</a>: I'm just deleting these spaces after the periods of the document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3707.668s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor, feel free to just keep your mics on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3711.491s">[Leming]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3792.275s">[Leming]</a>: So wait.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3797.239s">[Leming]</a>: Or in our, maybe, was it November?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3799.401s">[Leming]</a>: Was it the November's newsletter?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3830.972s">[Leming]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3840.037s">[Leming]</a>: Anybody else have any suggestions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3856.523s">[Leming]</a>: That would be too difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3860.145s">[Leming]</a>: That'd be too difficult to format in LaTeX.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3862.746s">[Leming]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3865.347s">[Leming]</a>: No, it's really hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3867.685s">[Leming]</a>: motion to accept and publish the newsletter is motion to Publish the Proven publish the newsletter pending.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3879.909s">[Leming]</a>: Uh, the events of December 11th because I think there is one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3914.459s">[Leming]</a>: And finally, okay, so that won't be going out until tomorrow because we still have the future to consider<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3928.522s">[Leming]</a>: those committee meetings haven't actually happened yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3932.064s">[Leming]</a>: Okay, lastly, 24073 offered by Councilors Callahan, Sangam, Lazzaro, resolution to establish a City Council listening session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3955.208s">[Leming]</a>: City Councilor Callahan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=4042.146s">[Leming]</a>: I'll look into scheduling that and making sure folks are available for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=4047.849s">[Leming]</a>: I know I personally won't be available on the 4th, but I'm sure that somebody will be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=4055.434s">[Leming]</a>: Any other updates?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=4059.687s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Lazzaro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=4065.008s">[Leming]</a>: Before, do we have anybody who wants to say anything publicly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=4070.049s">[Leming]</a>: Any public comment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=4071.729s">[Leming]</a>: Going once, going twice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=4073.81s">[Leming]</a>: On the motion to adjourn by Councilor Lazzaro, do we have a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=4082.432s">[Leming]</a>: Seconded by Councilor Tseng.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=4084.492s">[Leming]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=4085.352s">[Leming]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=4086.152s">[Leming]</a>: Opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=4087.053s">[Leming]</a>: Motion passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=4087.973s">[Leming]</a>: Meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1962.91s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you, Vice President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1965.029s">[Leming]</a>: Collins and everybody for all your work on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1968.13s">[Leming]</a>: I have been thinking for most of this meeting about the exact definition of bulk surveillance data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1973.772s">[Leming]</a>: I would also ask that KP law in considering a definition of bulk surveillance data also include a provision to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1990.053s">[Leming]</a>: include data that is synthetically generated to be similar to bulk surveillance data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=1997.939s">[Leming]</a>: So in my day job, I'm actually a machine learning researcher and that is one loophole that could potentially be used to get around the acquisition of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=2011.092s">[Leming]</a>: that sort of bulk data is you could actually train models that could generate data that's similar to bulk data without actually handing the data itself over to another entity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=2022.038s">[Leming]</a>: So in coming up with that definition, I would just ask that KP Law consider that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=2028.941s">[Leming]</a>: And I'd also be willing to talk to them myself about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=2035.991s">[Leming]</a>: This actually is like an issue that legislatures are running into when they're trying to come up with the appropriate definitions for this technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=2044.794s">[Leming]</a>: So, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=2773.116s">[Leming]</a>: request guidance on language for... Yes, an amendment to that is to request legal guidance on the use of synthetically generated data in the definition of bulk surveillance data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=2832.134s">[Leming]</a>: Request legal opinion on the use of synthetically generated data in our definition of bulk surveillance data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=2869.345s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pUMtYvwLQbQ&t=2908.177s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=2970.317s">[Leming]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=2972.038s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=2972.398s">[Leming]</a>: Can you going back to the timeline in the beginning and thinking about parking, is there<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=2979.208s">[Leming]</a>: Is transportation going to be included as a discussion topic in itself?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=2984.61s">[Leming]</a>: And if so, what month is that planned for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3137.008s">[Leming]</a>: No, I was just going to confirm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3472.498s">[Leming]</a>: Yes, I would like to point out this doesn't solve the issue of quite informing residents before things happen, but a good deal of effort is put into summarizing these meetings in the City Council newsletter in about as high level terms as possible, which I typically do include links to these<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3495.965s">[Leming]</a>: plans in the planning and permitting descriptions of what happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3500.128s">[Leming]</a>: So it's not a perfect solution to all of the concerns that were brought up by my colleague, but that is one mechanism where we're trying to really simplify what is happening in this committee as it happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cCFTFy23gjY&t=761.948s">[Leming]</a>: Present<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cCFTFy23gjY&t=870.79s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cCFTFy23gjY&t=1022.575s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cCFTFy23gjY&t=1086.495s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=360.176s">[Leming]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1379.187s">[Leming]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1381.408s">[Leming]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1382.924s">[Leming]</a>: Right now, they're the two moving parts that are first the homeworld petition going into the State House, which.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1394.304s">[Leming]</a>: I believe they should be hopefully submitted when they convene.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1399.289s">[Leming]</a>: And then if it gets approved, it will allow the city to do those regular updates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1404.995s">[Leming]</a>: The other part of that is we were advised by the planning department that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1415.752s">[Leming]</a>: It would be best to finish the affordable housing nexus studies before we went forward with actually updating leakage fee ordinance to include a direct link to the affordable housing trust and as I explained there are some<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1431.546s">[Leming]</a>: legal reasons behind that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1432.847s">[Leming]</a>: So if the ordinance were passed before there was a study justifying it, then it could be struck down in court.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1441.033s">[Leming]</a>: So the draft language for that is all finished.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1445.676s">[Leming]</a>: It's all completed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1447.257s">[Leming]</a>: I've been corresponding with the mayor and she's getting the money<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1453.341s">[Leming]</a>: she's told me to actually fund this $80,000 Nexus study to put money from the Capital Improvements Program into the Affordable Housing Trust.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1463.324s">[Leming]</a>: And then once that's underway, we could just officially pass the edits, which again, have already been discussed extensively in committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1576.441s">[Leming]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1577.201s">[Leming]</a>: So that whole project kind of split off into two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1581.782s">[Leming]</a>: So a couple of the things that I was working on initially ended up kind of being papers that I submitted to Inns Associates for the planning process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1593.803s">[Leming]</a>: The commercial vacancy tax, um, I think it became clear during the 1 meeting that we had on it that it would require.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1602.986s">[Leming]</a>: probably meeting a few more meetings with building department and other parties to planning department to figure out the future of that, but I also submitted a request to the planning folks to include a building vacancy<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1626.042s">[Leming]</a>: uh, tax, which is a building vacancy, I would say a fee, which is something that has been implemented in other cities without the need for a home rule petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1635.885s">[Leming]</a>: And it's not quite the level of a tax, but that's kind of like the other manifestation of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1641.286s">[Leming]</a>: Um, it would just come up later in the zoning process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4404.321s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4404.761s">[Leming]</a>: We have a residence guide in English.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4408.264s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you, Councilor Tseng, for making that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4410.806s">[Leming]</a>: It needs to be made multilingual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4413.849s">[Leming]</a>: We'll do that later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4415.79s">[Leming]</a>: Modernizing city council communications has really been the major project of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4420.76s">[Leming]</a>: Um, we have basically every meeting we draft a newsletter, send it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4424.723s">[Leming]</a>: We also have YouTube streaming, which is pretty cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4427.565s">[Leming]</a>: I'd like to thank all my colleagues for creating the listening sessions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4432.89s">[Leming]</a>: So far we've had three with the Arab community, the Portuguese speaking community and seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4438.374s">[Leming]</a>: Um, it was found in practice that these were kind of difficult to like, it was difficult to like organize all of these in, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4448.541s">[Leming]</a>: Um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4448.621s">[Leming]</a>: Practice and kind of like a one off fashion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4450.761s">[Leming]</a>: So we're going to continue to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4452.102s">[Leming]</a>: But Councilor Lazzaro and I have also decided to start scheduling regular listening sessions at the senior center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4459.023s">[Leming]</a>: Uh, next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4460.484s">[Leming]</a>: Um, we.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4463.864s">[Leming]</a>: Past a and also, um, like to thank Councilor Cal and for work on the upcoming listening session at the West<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4475.845s">[Leming]</a>: Harmon Zuckerman, PB – He, Him, His): Have a welcoming ordinance like to thank Councilor Tseng for introducing that last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4481.187s">[Leming]</a>: Sorry for all the jumping around that you're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4482.907s">[Leming]</a>: I just kind of made a text list so that I can do this quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4485.508s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4486.268s">[Leming]</a>: Harmon Zuckerman, PB – He, Him, His.:<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4488.009s">[Leming]</a>: : A welcoming ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4489.369s">[Leming]</a>: Harmon Zuckerman, PB – He, Him, His.:<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4490.35s">[Leming]</a>: : Which was passed for first reading last night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4495.085s">[Leming]</a>: And hopefully will be passed for a third reading on January 14.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4502.033s">[Leming]</a>: I don't know if this was in there, but if this is in the governing agenda, because it was kind of put on there as an ad hoc thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4512.751s">[Leming]</a>: as a result of the veteran services director efforts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4515.933s">[Leming]</a>: But we're working right now on a veteran veteran rental assistant program, which is set to be discussed in council on the 14th and hopefully passed for a first reading them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4527.661s">[Leming]</a>: But I still have to submit that paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4529.202s">[Leming]</a>: Um, Councilor Callahan and I, this is another one that's not on the agenda, but these things kind of crop up are also working with some, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4538.71s">[Leming]</a>: uh, mothers of kids with disabilities, uh, to, uh, create after school programs for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4546.497s">[Leming]</a>: Uh, there, a lot of the stuff mentioned here is some of the commission, uh, work that Councilor Tseng is working on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4553.403s">[Leming]</a>: I know that there are, uh, he's doing a lot of behind the scenes work on a human rights commission ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4559.608s">[Leming]</a>: Um, I don't, I'm not always a hundred percent aware, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4564.759s">[Leming]</a>: what is going on behind the scenes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4566.9s">[Leming]</a>: Some of these were introduced before I was on council, but whenever he does have progress, I make sure to make time in the committee so that we can move on those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4579.004s">[Leming]</a>: I know that the, I believe that the data policies that are mentioned there haven't been worked on, worked on a whole lot, but that could be something that we start on the next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4593.542s">[Leming]</a>: And that is all that I have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4764.117s">[Leming]</a>: Motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4766.178s">[Leming]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4766.358s">[Leming]</a>: Withdrawn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4900.228s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1109.734s">[Leming]</a>: I find the records in order and move to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1315.551s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1317.232s">[Leming]</a>: At the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee, we discussed and heard public comments in favor of the Welcoming City Ordinance, which we are discussing tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1328.536s">[Leming]</a>: We also drafted a newsletter and briefly discussed some scheduling of the City Council's upcoming listening sessions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7338.585s">[Leming]</a>: Yes, thank you, Council President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7340.887s">[Leming]</a>: So I didn't do this earlier because I wanted to hear what the folks from the DBW in the room had to say during public comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7351.953s">[Leming]</a>: And it is a point that I have a lot of sympathy with considering that I work a job where I get<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7358.426s">[Leming]</a>: uh, urinalysis testing in front of my colleagues at least three times a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7362.668s">[Leming]</a>: So, um, but there are, there are, uh, other issues with this resolution that I have mainly OML considerations, which has been discussed in this council before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7374.173s">[Leming]</a>: And I want more information about the private investigator issue, uh, as well as, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7382.998s">[Leming]</a>: the fact that I'm not sure about the city council stepping into strictly school committee issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7388.843s">[Leming]</a>: So I'm going to go and invoke rule 21 on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7390.845s">[Leming]</a>: We can move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7392.266s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7589.744s">[Leming]</a>: No, I'm keeping, I'm keeping my rule 21 invocation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7593.687s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8700.479s">[Leming]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12827.95s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12828.27s">[Leming]</a>: I'm just going to share my screen really quickly to this Google document that I have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12834.656s">[Leming]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12836.497s">[Leming]</a>: Can everybody see that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12840.841s">[Leming]</a>: Hello?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12843.143s">[Leming]</a>: All right, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12844.837s">[Leming]</a>: So we went over the text of this in the most recent meeting of the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12854.521s">[Leming]</a>: Following that meeting, I had some lengthy discussions and feedback from the City's legal teams, as well as some lawyers that work with the ACLU who are involved with Medford People Power.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12870.325s">[Leming]</a>: And I was kind of doing a little bit of back and forth to figure out what sort of language both parties could agree upon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12878.33s">[Leming]</a>: Before I get into it, I'll also quickly add that this version that I'm working with contains a slight change from what was forwarded to my colleagues earlier today, because just before the meeting, I believe it was Councilor Callaghan who noticed some misspellings under whistleblower protection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12897.04s">[Leming]</a>: I ended up amending that in this current draft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12899.762s">[Leming]</a>: But essentially, the reviews by the city's legal team<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12908.923s">[Leming]</a>: clarified the relationship throughout a lot of this ordinance with respect to the city's working relationship with federal agents and federal law and sort of how that works out in practice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12922.17s">[Leming]</a>: So there's a couple of points here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12925.231s">[Leming]</a>: For instance, the use of local resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12927.813s">[Leming]</a>: What you can see here is in green, these are the edits that were provided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12931.975s">[Leming]</a>: And these are sort of edits that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12935.542s">[Leming]</a>: This kind of covers situations where if someone is detained and they end up getting fingerprinted as a result of a criminal proceeding, then that biometric data would end up going into a sort of a centralized government database, which is just how criminal<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12962.808s">[Leming]</a>: enforcement works, both on the federal and local level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12966.391s">[Leming]</a>: But that doesn't really say, but that's kind of like separate from its potential relationship with ICE.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12974.898s">[Leming]</a>: And there's just a few, there's a few other things here that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12980.729s">[Leming]</a>: kind of that site-specific federal laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12984.352s">[Leming]</a>: One thing that came up that the ACLU lawyers pointed out was this phrase right here, an officer employee of Medford Police Department may participate or assist with an operation led by a federal immigration agency to detain persons for civil immigration enforcement purposes unless it is in direct response to a request for immediate response on a temporary basis for officer safety purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13009.313s">[Leming]</a>: or assistance in the apprehension of an individual for whom there is an active arrest warrant issued by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13017.038s">[Leming]</a>: This officer safety phrase in quotes is actually fairly common to include in these sorts of ordinances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13026.083s">[Leming]</a>: And there is a history of court decisions about the use of officer safety and asking for assistance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13034.188s">[Leming]</a>: So I'm comfortable including that in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13039.78s">[Leming]</a>: Otherwise the most the biggest changes that Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13066.281s">[Leming]</a>: Yes, yes, it does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13067.922s">[Leming]</a>: The main, so I'll get to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13071.123s">[Leming]</a>: So the main points that the city brought up was the complaints enforcement, et cetera, bits that were added in there at a point in the editing process where<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13090.26s">[Leming]</a>: We originally had this complaints, this complaints procedure, but that actually that actually was redundant to the internal policies of the Medford Police Department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13101.807s">[Leming]</a>: So we ended up deleting that and this other cause of action that there that ended up that turns out that that just replicates things that are already in involved in state and federal law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13113.534s">[Leming]</a>: But otherwise, yeah, this replicates state and federal laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13116.816s">[Leming]</a>: But otherwise, these changes<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13120.291s">[Leming]</a>: basically just make this ordinance consistent with, um, just clarifies the relationship of the ordinance with federal law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13130.574s">[Leming]</a>: I'd be pleased to answer any specific questions from my colleagues about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13926.324s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, so I just would like to reiterate that I did reach out to all members of the school committee as well as Chief Buckley and asked all of them to submit their feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13942.03s">[Leming]</a>: I invited the chief over to the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee meeting with any concerns or feedback that he might have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13951.274s">[Leming]</a>: I did not receive a reply.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13954.594s">[Leming]</a>: to that request and I did receive some from the from the school committee and their feedback was incorporated into it into this draft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13968.877s">[Leming]</a>: The concern that I had, the concern that I ran into from the administration regarding the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13977.766s">[Leming]</a>: regarding the police mainly had to do with the enforcement clause, which I was told could interfere with police union negotiations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13986.511s">[Leming]</a>: And in this current draft, that ended up being nixed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13991.413s">[Leming]</a>: So I would like to point out that there were efforts to include that feedback into this draft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14004.125s">[Leming]</a>: The other thing I'd like to point out is that there is a timeliness issue to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14011.652s">[Leming]</a>: The new administration takes office in late January, so I do think that more so than other ordinances, having a policy that protects our undocumented populations in early is essential to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14029.793s">[Leming]</a>: Um, I don't see I don't really see the need to try to weigh the three readings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14034.556s">[Leming]</a>: That's unanimous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14035.676s">[Leming]</a>: And, you know, obviously, my colleague is voiced his concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14038.938s">[Leming]</a>: So I would be fine with going for the with just approving the first reading tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14045.582s">[Leming]</a>: I would ask that that motion be amended to specifically accept the edits that were that were proposed in this in this current draft because I didn't hear that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14058.246s">[Leming]</a>: that that was explicitly said in the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14060.507s">[Leming]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14060.928s">[Leming]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14062.129s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14062.849s">[Leming]</a>: Otherwise, that's all I got.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14064.17s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15432.092s">[Leming]</a>: No, so I corresponded with the folks at both the folks at KP Law and Medford People Power, including Lauren Jean about this earlier today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15448.942s">[Leming]</a>: So the, I believe it was Jean was talking about 5103C.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15457.087s">[Leming]</a>: Was that what she mentioned?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15461.115s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15464.378s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, so I put into this current draft the one change that was proposed for that, that they proposed for that, which was that no Asian officer employee of the city in performance of official duties shall make any inquiry about citizenship, immigration, or residency status.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15483.754s">[Leming]</a>: And they specifically wanted to make it so that they couldn't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15489.631s">[Leming]</a>: ask about immigration status.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15494.553s">[Leming]</a>: But I am not 100% sure where else this would have weakened it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15504.198s">[Leming]</a>: So yeah, I did respond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15504.938s">[Leming]</a>: I did respond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15509.08s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15614.505s">[Leming]</a>: So the deleted one was the struck through version was no officers or employees of the city of Method may inquire about the immigration status of a victim, suspect, arrestee, 911 caller or other member of the public with whom they have contact except as required by state law or to provide a public benefit and the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15636.152s">[Leming]</a>: replacement was no agent, officer or employee of the city in the performance of official duties shall make any inquiry about the citizenship, immigration or residency status of any person seeking to enforce rights or obtain benefits or discriminate in the enforcement of rights or the granting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15654.306s">[Leming]</a>: of benefits on such basis, unless federal or Massachusetts law so requires for the termination of eligibility of benefits or as may otherwise be required by law or a court of competent jurisdiction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15666.468s">[Leming]</a>: No police officer or any city employee shall inquire about the citizenship or immigration status of any victim or witness of domestic violence or any other crime except as required by law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15676.53s">[Leming]</a>: That's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=16439.921s">[Leming]</a>: Yes.<br><br>
