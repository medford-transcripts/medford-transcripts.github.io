    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2770.646s">[Leming]</a>: Rose, we had a we had a very short city council meeting, but sorry, I wanted to, I just wanted to add on to what Zach was saying about the long term financial plan of the city, which was a lot of what city council doing is right<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2788.795s">[Leming]</a>: Right now, is establishing sort of the instruments of municipal finance and governance that other surrounding towns have sort of taken for granted for a very long time and I don't think that's always obvious to people who are looking in a good example is the stabilization funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2807.601s">[Leming]</a>: you know, we decided to create a couple of rainy day funds and allocate some cash into them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2815.203s">[Leming]</a>: And that's something that the vast majority of cities in Massachusetts have had forever that this city council only recently actually instituted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2825.285s">[Leming]</a>: Only last year we established an affordable housing trust so that we put some money towards affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2830.707s">[Leming]</a>: That was something that Somerville established like 30 years ago and it's been collecting money ever<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2837.563s">[Leming]</a>: ever since.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2839.865s">[Leming]</a>: Our zoning really should have been overhauled a very long time ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2845.971s">[Leming]</a>: With regards to a lot of the HR issues that were just being discussed earlier, that's not just a case for getting retrograde, it's not just a case for the teachers union, it's a case for all<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2859.262s">[Leming]</a>: pretty much all city staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2861.163s">[Leming]</a>: We asked HR that during a meeting a couple months ago, and they said they don't have the financial software to do those calculations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2870.165s">[Leming]</a>: They literally have to calculate everything by hand on paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2873.926s">[Leming]</a>: That's not something that most other organizations have to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2879.668s">[Leming]</a>: A lot of our long-term financial planning, just to be clear, is establishing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2887.543s">[Leming]</a>: be, it's just getting things that other areas have taken for granted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2892.204s">[Leming]</a>: So I just wanted to make that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2894.265s">[Leming]</a>: I'll get off the panel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1714.838s">[Leming]</a>: I'm going to try to respond to one thing there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1716.578s">[Leming]</a>: I didn't hear a specific question, but you did say that Medford's not like our surrounding towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1724.02s">[Leming]</a>: No, I said Winchester.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1725.081s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, we're not like Winchester.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1726.521s">[Leming]</a>: 90% of cities in the state of Massachusetts have had an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1732.203s">[Leming]</a>: Medford has one of the lowest operating budgets per capita of any city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1741.625s">[Leming]</a>: midsize city in the state of Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1744.446s">[Leming]</a>: And that is in large part because we are one of the 10% of cities that has never had an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1751.749s">[Leming]</a>: So you're right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1752.409s">[Leming]</a>: We are not like our neighbors that have had overrides and we have less money for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2282.138s">[Leming]</a>: Saying that we can address the budgetary problems of the Medford public school system with free cash is like me saying the government gave me a $1,200 check from COVID.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2295.965s">[Leming]</a>: So I don't have to look for a job right now because that check is going to last me another<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2301.493s">[Leming]</a>: another two weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2303.313s">[Leming]</a>: It's the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2304.153s">[Leming]</a>: The government gave us, the government gave the city of Medford some money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2308.554s">[Leming]</a>: It was a one-time thing from COVID and the proposal that we can plug ongoing costs from free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2315.175s">[Leming]</a>: All that would do is drain our reserves and we'd be back at square one in five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2323.137s">[Leming]</a>: If these overrides don't pass straight up, there will be layoffs in the school system and the roads will continue to be in disrepair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2330.538s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2792.681s">[Leming]</a>: So adding on to what Councilor Callahan said, partially this is due to the lingering costs of COVID, which resulted in both decreased funding going to the school system, partially that was just because you have fewer students going into public schools, and partially because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2812.608s">[Leming]</a>: there was a lot of activity in the healthcare system from COVID.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2815.793s">[Leming]</a>: So there is a sort of a, so the cost of health insurance, which we have to pay ended up rising.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2821.504s">[Leming]</a>: Those are some of the more short term reasons why we need this now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2824.809s">[Leming]</a>: Longer term,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2826.321s">[Leming]</a>: The way that Prop 2 NAP is designed is the total amount of money that the city can take in basically can't go up by more than 2.5% every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2836.11s">[Leming]</a>: While inflation has averaged for the past 44 years at 3.1% over time, that compounds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2842.436s">[Leming]</a>: So the budget today<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2844.137s">[Leming]</a>: is only a fraction, well, it's only about 78% as valuable today as it was back in 1980.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2852.464s">[Leming]</a>: So Prop 2.5 has this effect long-term on municipal budget where it squeezes resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2858.929s">[Leming]</a>: Most cities in Massachusetts have addressed this with the intended mechanism for overcoming this, which is periodic elections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2867.675s">[Leming]</a>: This is just the first time we're doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2869.677s">[Leming]</a>: That's part of the reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2871.318s">[Leming]</a>: the fact that we're so late to the game there is part of the reason that again we are 320 out of 351 cities in terms of our per capita budget and that is the reason why our schools could definitely be doing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2887.594s">[Leming]</a>: better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2888.174s">[Leming]</a>: That is the reason why you see so many potholes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2890.435s">[Leming]</a>: This is one step in addressing that situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2894.918s">[Leming]</a>: Once again, free cash, one time funding is not an actual longer term solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2902.141s">[Leming]</a>: If we just went with free cash, that would be drained in a couple of years, even shorter than the four to five year span I put, I said earlier, and then that's time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4482.151s">[Leming]</a>: I'm sorry, just to go back on that 3 to 5% thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4484.993s">[Leming]</a>: It's not 3 to 5% in totality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4486.713s">[Leming]</a>: It actually is recommended to generate 3 to 5% in free cash every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4491.036s">[Leming]</a>: So that is correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4492.717s">[Leming]</a>: I'm not sure where you're getting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4497.639s">[Leming]</a>: You can Google it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4498.64s">[Leming]</a>: You can look it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4499.32s">[Leming]</a>: I encourage you to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4501.161s">[Leming]</a>: But the point is, you generate three to 5% in free cash, and then it goes that can aggregate over time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4506.984s">[Leming]</a>: And then that can go towards one time capital expenditures, like for instance, two new fire trucks for the fire department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4513.427s">[Leming]</a>: That's how these big, that's how these sort of, I'd say, midsize expenses are accounted for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4520.003s">[Leming]</a>: Again, if I have a savings account and I'm living above my means, then eventually the savings account would run out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4531.491s">[Leming]</a>: So you're not supposed to plug the school budget every single year with free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4537.594s">[Leming]</a>: because it would run out eventually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4540.115s">[Leming]</a>: We did that with $1.75 million this past year with the understanding that we would then do an override to try to fix the problem in the long term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4549.658s">[Leming]</a>: Free cash is not a long-term solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4552.459s">[Leming]</a>: That keeps getting repeated, and I really just want to drive the point home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4556.04s">[Leming]</a>: It is not actually an answer to this problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4645.897s">[Leming]</a>: So in terms of how much free cash we actually have left, I don't have the numbers right in front of me, but I'm just remembering the expenditures off the top of my head.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4656.42s">[Leming]</a>: I believe after it was certified this past June, the number was 34 million, but I believe enough of that has been earmarked for various one-time expenditures at this point so that the actual number is, correct me if I'm wrong, would be about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4671.222s">[Leming]</a>: 10 to 11 million in reserves right now just because I see so much I can see someone shaking their head in the audience but I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4682.905s">[Leming]</a>: So again, this is ballpark numbers because we did allocate free cash first for the stabilization funds, which recently went to things like those light posts that were falling over, that were, you know, rusted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4698.65s">[Leming]</a>: They went to $3 million for the MSBA study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4703.732s">[Leming]</a>: It went to pay for HVAC systems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4707.833s">[Leming]</a>: It went to pay for, there was a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4713.5s">[Leming]</a>: Yeah, there's a long list of items that were in some memos from a couple of months ago that I think some of my colleagues could help me out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5408.745s">[Leming]</a>: Councilor Lemming, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5412.126s">[Leming]</a>: I'd just like to really emphasize that if you're interested in learning more about the shortfalls in the school, in the Medford Public Schools budget, then the videos and the presentations that were given during the budget season at the Medford School Committee meetings, I believe around June, would be where you want to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5432.612s">[Leming]</a>: So those are on YouTube.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5433.752s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5828.308s">[Leming]</a>: So for the size of the override, what I'll say is that we got, we went 44 years without an override, and this is the first time that we're asking the voters to do an override, which has become very commonplace in other communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5846.658s">[Leming]</a>: And so, yeah, if we, you know, there potentially is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5853.301s">[Leming]</a>: a debt exclusion in the future for the high school as a capital project, but just in terms of level expenses, the overrides are a mechanism to undo, to overcome the effects of inflation long-term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5869.773s">[Leming]</a>: So I will just point out that we've gone this long without an override, and this is the first time that we're asking for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5877.867s">[Leming]</a>: We've survived pretty long so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5881.669s">[Leming]</a>: And we're pretty late to the game, to be honest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5886.753s">[Leming]</a>: Will another override be needed in another 44 years?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5890.635s">[Leming]</a>: Maybe, because inflation will keep going up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5894.017s">[Leming]</a>: But right now, we know that we need this, or else, again, the roads will continue to be in the state that they're in, and we will have to have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5904.376s">[Leming]</a>: a lot of layoffs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5905.357s">[Leming]</a>: That's not a scare tactic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5906.457s">[Leming]</a>: That's just the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5907.798s">[Leming]</a>: It's just math.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5908.739s">[Leming]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7343.632s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7344.352s">[Leming]</a>: So I would like to point out that in asking for specifics for these things, there is a bit of a kind of a circular logic that goes in because if hypothetically we were to put forward to the voters the exact pay scale of each teacher in each line item, that's not really possible because union contracts haven't actually been negotiated, haven't been negotiated yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7366.819s">[Leming]</a>: So that would be premature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7371.861s">[Leming]</a>: No, no, no, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7376.284s">[Leming]</a>: And so, I mean, it goes for a lot of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7380.147s">[Leming]</a>: It goes for the development of the plans for a fire station as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7385.03s">[Leming]</a>: So you don't have to have the plans completely finalized and approved, but you can have a estimate for the full cost of the station from the people that are developing the plans beforehand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7397.218s">[Leming]</a>: Right now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7398.178s">[Leming]</a>: estimate is $30 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7400.48s">[Leming]</a>: And it goes, I mean, it goes for the salaries as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7404.282s">[Leming]</a>: So, you know, we are, we put in the ballot questions, the areas where it would go to, but we can't say it will go to 10 teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7413.529s">[Leming]</a>: It will go to 15 parents, et cetera, because those need to be negotiated after the fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7418.632s">[Leming]</a>: On the other hand, if, on the other hand, if we do<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7421.574s">[Leming]</a>: I've also heard people say, OK, how can you promise higher wages, for instance, if those contracts haven't been negotiated?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7428.961s">[Leming]</a>: So this becomes a bit of a chicken and egg problem when asking for specifics versus not being specific enough on these valid questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7436.549s">[Leming]</a>: I'd just like to make that general point, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8495.515s">[Leming]</a>: Well, just to make the point that if you have a, you know, we, this is a request to pay slightly more property taxes, but it also goes along with the general point of, yeah, $37 a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8509.626s">[Leming]</a>: That's, that is slightly more, you know, with the, to go along with the general point of you get what you pay for,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8519.887s">[Leming]</a>: Again, we are a very underfunded city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8524.112s">[Leming]</a>: And we would like that to not be the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8527.216s">[Leming]</a>: And this is a step in the right direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8530.96s">[Leming]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9071.544s">[Leming]</a>: I'm sorry, where is the woman who asked the question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9079.227s">[Leming]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9080.028s">[Leming]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9081.208s">[Leming]</a>: No, I just wanted to point out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9082.309s">[Leming]</a>: So there was, so I've seen this, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9085.566s">[Leming]</a>: error that people have been doing with the DLS calculator the past week or so, where they're taking the $7.5 million that comes from questions seven and eight combined, and then they're just adding that to the $30 million and then saying... I think she just added the $2 million for the estimated... Yeah, that is actually...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9600.659s">[Leming]</a>: So first, just to make the point that disagreeing doesn't mean it's a fear attack, it just means I disagree with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9607.391s">[Leming]</a>: Just want to put that out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9609.082s">[Leming]</a>: The actual answer to that is that the communities that haven't had to do Prop 2.5 overrides to keep a level budget are either the communities that have just much bigger budgets overall than we do, like Boston, or in cases like Cambridge, they invested in areas like Kendall Square years and years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9633.961s">[Leming]</a>: Medford could have invested in that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9638.504s">[Leming]</a>: kind of development a long time ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9640.045s">[Leming]</a>: We just never did that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9641.847s">[Leming]</a>: And smaller communities that don't really have the opportunity to do that sort of commercial development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9646.891s">[Leming]</a>: Some towns are basically just residential properties and not a whole lot of commercial activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9653.596s">[Leming]</a>: They have to do these sorts of overrides regularly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9656.258s">[Leming]</a>: So Medford kind of avoided this by just doing cuts and cuts and cuts until we became a very underfunded community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9663.879s">[Leming]</a>: And now that we're at this point, there's really not much of a choice except for either kicking the can down the road more, which doesn't solve the problem, or doing one of these overrides like Our Neighbors, or we could get a time machine and do a lot more commercial development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9682.142s">[Leming]</a>: But of course, that's not an option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9683.603s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10017.063s">[Leming]</a>: I mean, I think we've already gone over the free cash issue quite a bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10025.929s">[Leming]</a>: It wouldn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10027.69s">[Leming]</a>: That's the answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10029.412s">[Leming]</a>: We used $1.75 million in free cash to plug the budget with the understanding that we would have an override coming up on the ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10040.379s">[Leming]</a>: I think what my colleague is saying is that we should do that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10044.041s">[Leming]</a>: another year and then do an override the next year or so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10048.262s">[Leming]</a>: But it's, I'm honestly a bit confused why it keeps coming up as a solution to all of our problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10055.585s">[Leming]</a>: Cause it's not like you just can't use free cash year after year for salaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10061.486s">[Leming]</a>: That's not the way it works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10063.087s">[Leming]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12478.72s">[Leming]</a>: Now, Councilor Collins said a lot of points that I was going to make, which is to get the bird's eye view.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12486.546s">[Leming]</a>: Most of this council is pretty, is fairly new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12489.508s">[Leming]</a>: About half of us are in our first term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12493.231s">[Leming]</a>: And so we are trying to lay the foundations for the further growth and development of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12500.336s">[Leming]</a>: The most important thing, the most important component of that is the zoning overhaul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12506.232s">[Leming]</a>: a couple of meetings ago, I brought up a linkage fee proposal which would essentially raise the fees that developers pay for the first time to the city for their developments for the first time in 30 years that passed this council six to one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12521.824s">[Leming]</a>: I think that you'll find that we are intensely focused on the financials so that we will have growth for the next 10 years, for the next 20 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12532.312s">[Leming]</a>: In general, this city,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12536.278s">[Leming]</a>: a lot of the political history of this city has been sort of attempting to kick the can down the road or just say, oh, or just come up with like vague ways to say, oh, we should all come together and find solutions, but not actually ever backing anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12551.79s">[Leming]</a>: This council is actually laying the foundations and passing actual ordinances and legislation so that we won't have to worry about that in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12563.379s">[Leming]</a>: So yes, we are building a foundation that should have been built a very long time ago, and these overrides are really meant to address more short-term concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12573.108s">[Leming]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13410.931s">[Leming]</a>: So speaking a bit more of a bird's eye view of this, I do wish that things were better between the fire union and the mayor and that that process had gone better for both parties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13426.218s">[Leming]</a>: And I am sorry at how that has evolved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13429.5s">[Leming]</a>: My view of this is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13433.078s">[Leming]</a>: even is that the debt exclusion is about funding and it's not, I don't see it as necessarily being tied to whatever plans come out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13443.166s">[Leming]</a>: That's just how I view it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13446.849s">[Leming]</a>: So that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14169.056s">[Leming]</a>: I'm going to try to give more of a personal perspective of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14175.081s">[Leming]</a>: It's a good question, one that hasn't been directly addressed in these chambers too much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14179.085s">[Leming]</a>: I think, honestly, what we're seeing here is a bit of a generational divide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14185.65s">[Leming]</a>: So I think that previous generations of politicians quite literally came from a different part of town.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14196.069s">[Leming]</a>: I've literally analyzed this myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14197.53s">[Leming]</a>: I put up a blog post about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14198.831s">[Leming]</a>: And so there's a lot of people in the city who are used to having this personal relationship with their elected officials, because they're literally the people that they grew up with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14209.037s">[Leming]</a>: But over time, the demographics of Medford have shifted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14214.96s">[Leming]</a>: You have a much younger generation of voters, a lot more people moving in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14220.324s">[Leming]</a>: And so there's a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14223.26s">[Leming]</a>: And so most, I mean, most of the city counselors these days live in just literally a completely different geographical part of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14231.411s">[Leming]</a>: And so I've spoken to, you know, there's been a lot of angry meetings and there is like some folks who've come up and said, you know, very<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14239.918s">[Leming]</a>: unpleasant things to me, who I've later had very good one-on-one conversations with, and they've said, well, Matt, people are scared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14248.006s">[Leming]</a>: And I do think that in some cases that is the case, because they feel like they don't really know, at a personal level, some of the folks here, just because we do come<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14264.611s">[Leming]</a>: we are like literally living in a different part of town.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14267.852s">[Leming]</a>: Um, so I think that, I think that these sorts of things will heal, um, will heal over time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14274.693s">[Leming]</a>: Um, I think it's a matter of, I'm trying to figure out like who, uh, that comes to these meetings is willing to have a nice one-on-one conversation, develop those relationships.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14284.515s">[Leming]</a>: Not everybody is, but some people are, so it will heal with time is my take on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4487.355s">[Leming]</a>: Just to add to that, so this actually came up at an event at a small house party where we were talking about these measures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4498.262s">[Leming]</a>: Somebody asked me, well, if you're proposing to put $500,000 towards the GDW for road repairs, I live on a private road, how would that affect me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4508.769s">[Leming]</a>: I had no idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4509.93s">[Leming]</a>: So I ended up emailing Tim McGibbon, CC, the fellow who asked me, and what Tim said was that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4517.715s">[Leming]</a>: there is no, so just by the fact, by the nature of it being private, there's no legal obligation for him to actively repair these roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4528.639s">[Leming]</a>: But he said that they, if, when they have capacity, they will do it anyway, just to keep the city nice, and putting a permanent road repair crew into being going will just give them,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4543.585s">[Leming]</a>: more capacity to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4545.526s">[Leming]</a>: So that was his perspective on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4549.128s">[Leming]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5257.263s">[Leming]</a>: That's correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5258.124s">[Leming]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5258.264s">[Leming]</a>: No.<br><br>
