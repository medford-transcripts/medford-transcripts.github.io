 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/wMWBXVaYZ_w&t=6.258s">Hello,</a> Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/wMWBXVaYZ_w&t=7.398s">My</a> name is Matt Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/wMWBXVaYZ_w&t=8.619s">I'm</a> a scientist, a naval officer, and for the past two years, a city councilor, and I'm running for a second term. <a href="https://youtu.be/wMWBXVaYZ_w&t=15.581s">I</a> grew up in a military family, moved around a lot, did my PhD in the UK, and moved to Medford as a post-doc and mass general. <a href="https://youtu.be/wMWBXVaYZ_w&t=23.444s">Now,</a> when I moved here, I could barely pay for a room in a small apartment. <a href="https://youtu.be/wMWBXVaYZ_w&t=26.565s">That's</a> not because the research I was doing in Alzheimer's is not valuable. <a href="https://youtu.be/wMWBXVaYZ_w&t=30.306s">It's</a> because something about the system is broken. <a href="https://youtu.be/wMWBXVaYZ_w&t=33.973s">In</a> the past 41 years, U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/wMWBXVaYZ_w&t=36.255s">rents</a> have risen 323 percent, home prices 441 percent, and median household income a mere 37 percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/wMWBXVaYZ_w&t=46.642s">And</a> to even begin addressing this, we need to start locally. <a href="https://youtu.be/wMWBXVaYZ_w&t=50.205s">In</a> 2023, after lobbying council to pass an affordable housing trust, I ran for council myself, talked to a whole lot of voters, and began serving in 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/wMWBXVaYZ_w&t=61.145s">Massachusetts</a> has state laws that prevent city budgets from keeping up with inflation and Medford has stagnated in its growth for a very long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/wMWBXVaYZ_w&t=72.514s">So</a> Medford has a budget problem and Medford's housing is too expensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/wMWBXVaYZ_w&t=77.713s">This</a> past term, I and many of my colleagues on council have stopped kicking the can down the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/wMWBXVaYZ_w&t=82.739s">Backed</a> by many parents and young families in the community, we campaigned for a successful ballot initiative that saved 40 teaching jobs in the Medford Teachers Association and funded a full-time road repair crew in the Department of Public Works. <a href="https://youtu.be/wMWBXVaYZ_w&t=96.775s">This</a> past term, council approved new public housing for seniors, and I'm working at the state and local level to fund our new affordable housing trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/wMWBXVaYZ_w&t=105.246s">The</a> city and the community spent years developing a vision for the city that addresses our affordability crisis and dwindling budget, and I've been working to implement that. <a href="https://youtu.be/wMWBXVaYZ_w&t=114.677s">Our</a> current development is patchwork and we need a vision that leads to more sustainable growth in our city so that we can grow our tax base. <a href="https://youtu.be/wMWBXVaYZ_w&t=121.961s">I'm</a> also working on new building regulations to mitigate traffic demands brought on by new developments, discourage vacancies in current buildings, mandate greener building practices, and with an historic conversion ordinance, maintain the many historic buildings that compose Medford, all while incentivizing housing affordability. <a href="https://youtu.be/wMWBXVaYZ_w&t=143.485s">This</a> past term, I've made Council a more transparent body by instituting a City Council newsletter, live streaming our meetings on YouTube, holding office hours at the Medford Senior Center, and writing about all of it on my personal website nonstop. <a href="https://youtu.be/wMWBXVaYZ_w&t=158.975s">I</a> instituted a first-of-its-kind program to house low-income veterans, and I passed a law that will allow Medford residents to voluntarily donate to an in-need veterans fund on their tax bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/wMWBXVaYZ_w&t=171.004s">In</a> January, Council passed a Welcoming City Ordinance, and in my work with the Democratic City Committee, I spearheaded a campaign to inform non-English-speaking residents of their constitutional rights in these very dire times. <a href="https://youtu.be/wMWBXVaYZ_w&t=186.029s">In</a> short, I am not kicking the can down the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/wMWBXVaYZ_w&t=188.55s">I'm</a> putting in the work needed to make a vibrant, affordable, and welcoming community, and I will continue putting in the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/wMWBXVaYZ_w&t=194.952s">Thank</a> you very much for your time and attention, and don't forget to vote on November 4th.<h2><a href="../2025-10-08_vKjSCLc-dk0/2025-10-08_vKjSCLc-dk0.html">City Council 10-7-25</a></h2>
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vKjSCLc-dk0&t=1368.144s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vKjSCLc-dk0&t=1368.664s">At</a> the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee, we discussed the results of a few recent listening sessions and released the summer newsletter motion to approve.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vKjSCLc-dk0&t=2368.98s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vKjSCLc-dk0&t=2369.541s">And</a> I would like to thank my colleague, Councilor Lazzaro, for at least spearheading this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vKjSCLc-dk0&t=2375.826s">On</a> September 28th, Medford City Council received the following letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/vKjSCLc-dk0&t=2382.152s">Dear</a> Medford City Council, my name is Victoria and I'm 10 years old and I'm writing to you because I think there is a problem on Boston Avenue and High Street intersection. <a href="https://youtu.be/vKjSCLc-dk0&t=2391.967s">I</a> live right near that street and have to cross it every day with my sister on our walk to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/vKjSCLc-dk0&t=2396.612s">Recently,</a> my friend got hit by a car on that street. <a href="https://youtu.be/vKjSCLc-dk0&t=2400.035s">He</a> was fine, but it was still scary knowing that it happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/vKjSCLc-dk0&t=2404.3s">A</a> few years ago, my dad and I walked around with a petition to fix this street and we got over 159 responses. <a href="https://youtu.be/vKjSCLc-dk0&t=2411.857s">If</a> you want to know more, visit www.westmedford.us. <a href="https://youtu.be/vKjSCLc-dk0&t=2416.119s">I</a> really hope you can address this problem as soon as possible so me and 159 other Medford citizens can get where they need to be safely, since Syria, Victoria, Borowski. <a href="https://youtu.be/vKjSCLc-dk0&t=2427.426s">I'm</a> familiar with that intersection. <a href="https://youtu.be/vKjSCLc-dk0&t=2431.948s">Medford</a> has a number of very problematic intersections around town that we do need to improve that one, particularly if you're trying to get <a href="https://youtu.be/vKjSCLc-dk0&t=2441.788s">through</a> Boston Avenue and turn onto High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/vKjSCLc-dk0&t=2445.649s">It's</a> very tricky, very risky, and it's sort of like the center point of a lot of roads coming into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vKjSCLc-dk0&t=2456.39s">So</a> I would appreciate any effort that can be done by the Traffic Commission and our transportation engineer to address this. <a href="https://youtu.be/vKjSCLc-dk0&t=2467.052s">And</a> once again, I'd like to thank my colleague for her efforts on this.<h2><a href="../2025-10-01_L2PVZXRYAAI/2025-10-01_L2PVZXRYAAI.html">City Council 09-30-25</a></h2>
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=988.332s">Thank</a> you, Council President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=990.973s">So</a> I remember I visited Medford Rehab and Nursing a few months ago with Councilor Callahan to celebrate a woman's 104th birthday. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=1004.617s">Very,</a> very pleasant event. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=1006.238s">There</a> was someone playing a harp there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=1010.399s">The</a> woman asked me to give her my tie and I gave her my tie. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=1017.635s">and</a> had a very nice interaction. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=1020.956s">She</a> asked Councilor Callaghan for her jacket and well, it was a nice event. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=1031.76s">So</a> it's a good facility, but it's also very hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=1038.062s">I</a> remember years and years ago, my mom, she <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=1043.845s">went</a> back into the working world for a little bit and she took up a job as a CNA. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=1051.069s">She</a> worked at a nursing home and she quit after a couple of months because the conditions were so difficult and so nerve wracking to deal with. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=1066.238s">And</a> right now we have <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=1068.127s">a</a> lot of the workers at Medford Rehab and Nursing who are in, have been going through negotiations for months to get fair compensation. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=1079.75s">A</a> lot of these folks would have a difficult time finding work elsewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=1084.792s">A</a> lot of them are supporting families who are abroad and just trying to make a better life for themselves here. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=1092.574s">And</a> like any <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=1095.564s">union</a> contract negotiation process. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=1098.206s">It's</a> a struggle. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=1099.186s">It's</a> a back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=1100.147s">And</a> so I'm bringing this resolution just to offer my support and offer the support of this body to their struggle and hoping that some of my colleagues can join at the picket on October 2nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=1117.216s">So</a> thank you very much for listening and we stand with you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=1317.904s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=1318.324s">So</a> this is in response to a resident who's recently learned that they'll have to be paying out of pocket for waste removal services. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=1330.87s">Basically,</a> the city recently signed a contract that would sort of lop big apartment complexes and condominiums in with townhouses that are <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=1344.156s">laid</a> out much like single family homes and just basically put them all in the same category. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=1349.358s">So</a> people who live, basically in the same neighborhood in the same layout as many of their neighbors who are in single family homes, just are <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=1361.483s">learning</a> that they'll now have to pay for their own waste removal. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=1367.565s">So</a> this is just a resolution to get an update from the city on this issue and put some pressure on them to reconsider that waste removal contract so that it makes a little bit more sense to the day-to-day realities of these residents.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=2612.241s">I'd</a> just like to thank the residents who came out to talk about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=2619.565s">I</a> think that even if we <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=2624.034s">Even</a> if, as some of my colleagues are saying, we may not have the ability to change the contract, I'd still like to get some... Oh wait, I see that Tim McGivern has just raised his hand on Zoom, so.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=2677.801s">No,</a> I'd like to, I mean, I would, I was going to give concluding remarks but I would like to hear what BBW director McGovern says.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=3247.312s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=3248.473s">So</a> I just have a point that I want to make and then I have some specific questions for for Tim. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=3255.379s">So,</a> this, a lot of this actually relates back to goes goes back to proposition 2.5 and I'm pretty in some pretty weird ways so like. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=3265.047s">Proposition</a> 2.5 you know we had the first ever override for that this this past November, which went towards the school system as well as the, as well as the DPW but basically it means that the amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=3280.736s">Barring</a> new growth, the amount of money you're allowed to take in from property taxes can only go up 2.5% every year, unless either you have new growth or you have an override, which the residents vote on. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=3295.379s">Now,</a> inflation is usually about 3.1%. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=3297.96s">So</a> that means that over time, the value of the budget gets smaller and smaller. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=3305.361s">It</a> and it compounds it compounds exponentially. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=3309.505s">And</a> so when the budget gets smaller and smaller, that means you have weird situations like this where it doesn't actually end up saving residents money. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=3316.27s">It</a> just ends up distributing. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=3318.712s">It</a> just ends up redistributing these fees in in in different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=3324.937s">In</a> this case, the point that Councilor Lazzaro was making was that everybody is paying for everybody's trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=3330.381s">But</a> the folks in condos and townhouses are <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=3335.125s">also</a> paying for their own trash on top of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=3337.786s">So</a> this is a systemic issue like so many things that we experience in City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=3347.648s">And</a> I don't want anybody to make any mistake that this is systemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=3352.109s">I</a> don't think that there's like one party that you can blame. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=3356.47s">It's</a> the current system that we have in Massachusetts that's causing these <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=3361.211s">unequal</a> offsets on to on to certain residents and that is that is unfortunate. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=3366.017s">But</a> the questions that I had for DBW Commissioner McGivern were first, if you'd be so kind to answer them. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=3375.767s">Just</a> to clarify because one resident brought that up is, is there a legal means in <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=3382.775s">a</a> contract from to distinguish between a townhouse, like the residents were talking about and a condo I just want to, I just want that to be very clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=3392.048s">And</a> was, was that a, was that an option. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=3398.85s">when</a> the contract is being negotiated and what and the second question if you have this number off the top of your head is what approximately is the ratio between townhouse like the number of townhouses in Medford and the number of condos and I don't I don't expect you to have that number off the top of your head but if you did it would be it would be helpful for the for the conversation so if if Tim is still on.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=3522.321s">Um,</a> what approximately is the ratio between, um, town townhouses and <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=3530.46s">uh,</a> condos in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=3532.521s">And</a> I don't, I don't expect you to have those numbers off the top of their head, your head, but like how many, about how many of our, uh, 26,000 plus units are townhouses like the ones that residents are describing and about how many of them are condos.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=10753.327s">Yeah,</a> I think that if this were a serious objection to this ordinance, then it would have been important enough to email us about it when it was received. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=10766.289s">I'm</a> not, just like Council President Bears just mentioned, I'm not a fan of politically timed moves like this, which we've seen a lot of. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=10783.38s">say</a> what you want about the Salem Street message that we just got from the mayor through the CDB that we just referred back to the CDB. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=10796.743s">I</a> don't like the fact that it was announced the day after a preliminary election. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=10802.104s">And</a> I don't like the fact that this was literally thrown on our desk via paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=10811.089s">two</a> days before when apparently she's been sitting on it for a week it just means it's not it just means it's not really a serious objection that they're just like if this were if this were a serious thing like you know I would have gotten a phone call would have like had the common decency to email actually email this to us instead of just like this last minute <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=10830.798s">thing</a> to try to delay this ordinance for whatever reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=10836.222s">And,</a> you know, we see that pretty frequently as like a bad faith tactic to put off actually doing anything in this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=10846.069s">Like,</a> I remember like a while ago we got, just like prior to a meeting, we got like some <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=10852.562s">email</a> from somebody on a board asking us to just delay this whole meeting that we've been preparing months for just because they sent us a letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=10864.028s">It's</a> not something I take seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=10865.529s">So</a> I'm not going to comment on the content of it, because my colleagues already have done that very eloquently. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=10873.273s">But</a> I just want to comment that I really don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=10876.374s">I'm</a> not a fan of this sort of game of chicken and this political timing that we see a lot.<h2><a href="../2025-10-01_F1G_uayzNSg/2025-10-01_F1G_uayzNSg.html">City Council Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee 9-30-25</a></h2>

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F1G_uayzNSg&t=437.877s">Yep.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F1G_uayzNSg&t=508.975s">Sorry?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F1G_uayzNSg&t=509.135s">Just</a> turn your mic on to make sure that the mic is on. <a href="https://youtu.be/F1G_uayzNSg&t=514.037s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F1G_uayzNSg&t=514.337s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F1G_uayzNSg&t=679.123s">Yeah,</a> I do like this, this just showing that movement as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/F1G_uayzNSg&t=683.847s">So</a> I feel like it would help residents to sort of understand the process a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/F1G_uayzNSg&t=687.69s">But</a> I do I thank you for the wordsmithing. <a href="https://youtu.be/F1G_uayzNSg&t=690.673s">I</a> think it's essential.

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F1G_uayzNSg&t=793.455s">I</a> was just trying to break it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/F1G_uayzNSg&t=794.836s">Like</a> technically all this was in regular meetings, but.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F1G_uayzNSg&t=815.052s">Yeah,</a> that was the last bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/F1G_uayzNSg&t=816.653s">Justin?</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F1G_uayzNSg&t=922.07s">Okay,</a> so it was sent to public works and facilities?

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1468.652s">I</a> don't know if I could support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=1470.093s">No,</a> I'm kidding.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2250.423s">Yeah,</a> I was just a question for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2253.184s">Do</a> you think, I mean, do you think that the 2 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2255.124s">to</a> 1 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2256.005s">difference</a> from what Council Vice President Collins just suggested would make a very big difference for y'all? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2262.606s">Like,</a> do you think that that would be an acceptable compromise in your eyes?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2268.788s">Do</a> you think that moving the Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday hours from 2 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2275.23s">to</a> 1 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2275.99s">would</a> be an acceptable compromise in your eyes? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2280.275s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2281.256s">Yeah,</a> I don't like to hear residents coming in and talking about noise complaints that they didn't get a response to. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2291.824s">I</a> don't like to hear that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2293.846s">What</a> I also don't like to hear about is a company putting a big investment into <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2302.556s">Medford</a> in a place that we're really trying to do business development and then having it fail because the city council wasn't willing to be flexible and work with businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2313.459s">So</a> this is, I think that this is a, this is a balancing act. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2317.94s">Um,</a> I want to see businesses that decide to invest in our community do well. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2324.501s">And</a> I want to do everything that we can within reason to support that effort, because it is very important for the future of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=2331.823s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3463.952s">Yeah,</a> this is definitely one of those things where I would take the review period, very seriously, but it does, it does sound like, you know, adding, adding more noise wouldn't necessarily help out the business, because that's not what people were asking for by what you told by the anecdote that you just said but <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3483.457s">extending</a> the hours and doing something about the noise would overall help out both the businesses and the neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3491.999s">So</a> I do see this as kind of two different things, and I don't really see it that we need to, you know, I mean, punish a business for having some growing pains with the neighboring community, which does sound like it had a detrimental effect on <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3510.183s">Um,</a> you know, I don't want to, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3511.184s">Many</a> of the neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3512.225s">But</a> if we can just, you know, be responsive to that sort of sort of work with them compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3517.349s">Um</a> I don't I mean, City Council can drag its feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3521.052s">So</a> I think that if we were to wait another. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3523.634s">Six</a> months, um, to approve these hours, um, with, uh, Uh, and with the <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3538.727s">on</a> business. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3539.507s">So</a> to me, in my mind, the best solution is to have the review period, have it very carefully see if the effects of the very loud noise are still there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3555.355s">And</a> if the neighbors still notice it, but at the same time help out the businesses that are opening up nearby so that they don't all go over to the burn and we can start stealing business from Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3566.781s">Hopefully,</a> but no, I'd like to thank both you as well as the residents from the neighborhood for coming over and telling their story. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3577.988s">And</a> hopefully, you know, you'll be able to get the money for maybe a sound engineer to improve the acoustics of the place, like, you know, have some of those like foam panels on the side so that it doesn't quite go out into the community as much. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=3593.496s">But</a> so thank you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4362.115s">No,</a> I'd just like to say I'm very, very excited as well to see a coffee shop opening up in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4369.662s">I</a> lived in South Medford for five years and my Oasis Cafe was my go to place. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4377.268s">Now</a> I live pretty near Medford Square, but I don't I don't have like an oasis cafe that I can just waltz over to in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4385.054s">So</a> are you going to serve pumpkin spice lattes? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4388.657s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4388.937s">In</a> the fall? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4389.357s">You</a> are?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4390.538s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4391.499s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4391.959s">What</a> kinds of pastries? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4392.8s">No,</a> no, I'm kidding.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4397.624s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4397.904s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4398.224s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4398.524s">That</a> sounds solid. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4400.266s">Sounds</a> solid. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4400.966s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4401.347s">Thank</a> you very much for coming out tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4402.808s">Thanks.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4598.911s">I</a> just like to point out that the the zoom is a little bit weird tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4602.795s">It's</a> apparently requiring a passcode. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4604.416s">So</a> it's possible if the petitioner wanted to appear on zoom that they might not have been able to get in. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4612.965s">So</a> if if anybody wants to try to contact or reach out to the petitioner to see if that could be the issue that could be a <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4624.499s">could</a> be worthwhile. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4625.479s">Although</a> that being said, I would cafe in the public library. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4631.44s">That</a> sounds fine to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=4632.241s">I</a> would second the motion.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5246.621s">I'd</a> just like to thank you for applying for this role and congratulate you on being recommended for appointment. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5253.084s">Thank</a> you for coming to a city council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5257.066s">I</a> remember when I was first appointed to a board here, I had to sit here until something like 1am.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5265.93s">I</a> remember. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5268.162s">Yeah,</a> I remember, I remember. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5269.962s">And,</a> you know, I had to sit there cause sat through the whole thing, but I'm glad that we can get y'all, you and the next appointment to the CPC out of the way pretty quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5283.385s">And</a> just wish you luck on your service to the Affordable Housing Trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5289.686s">And</a> I look forward to working with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5290.807s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5291.367s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=5302.819s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6944.134s">So</a> this is how much you're requesting three. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6947.155s">If</a> you had to give an estimate, how many would you say that you needed if you like had an ideal number? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=6952.916s">Like,</a> do you think three would- I'd like to get more than three, but- How many more?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9429.916s">I'd</a> like to thank my colleague for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9432.997s">So</a> I'm a, I'm an AI researcher. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9435.538s">I</a> agree with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9436.919s">I</a> mean, AI is one of those, uh, it's kind of a weird area where it will have, and is currently having a lot of, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9446.573s">good</a> potential effects, also a lot of harms within the economy. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9451.757s">It's</a> a very powerful new, I'd say, range of technologies. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9458.262s">But</a> essentially what happens with the private sector is that somebody jumps on an LLM, which is a very generally useful tool, and then they try to sort of exploit it to see how they could <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9473.896s">cut</a> workers out or save on human resources and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9479.249s">Usually</a> the effect of doing that just ends up being <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9483.924s">not</a> really that great. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9485.045s">I</a> think that one thing that the unions that are endorsing the FAIR Act are saying, for instance, is AI is having a hugely detrimental effect just in hiring these days, where you basically will have AI algorithms that are trying to look at and automatically parse through resumes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9509.437s">And</a> then you also have <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9511.975s">people</a> that sort of know how to leverage this technology, submitting their resumes, using some form of automation to as many companies as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9519.821s">And</a> essentially what happens is workers just, instead of making an honest resume that <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9530.89s">shows</a> their experiences. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9532.01s">They</a> just learn how to sort of like phrase things correctly or write their resume in such a way that it'll be picked up by a certain LLM. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9540.713s">And</a> when you have people that are submitting thousands upon thousands of resumes to thousands upon thousands of job openings, automatically it becomes impossible for HR people to actually look through them all one by one. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9552.196s">And</a> so the whole hiring market already has been <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9556.812s">really</a> damaged by AI in some sectors. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9560.958s">So</a> that's just one instance of where it's being massively misused. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9569.951s">And</a> then some other employers also like to put out <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9573.115s">ghost</a> listings, where they just try to collect as many resumes as possible to train their own AI modules without actually ever hiring anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9580.979s">So</a> that's another trend that companies are doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9584.14s">And</a> it's having a very strange effect on the economy. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9587.942s">So</a> just to give folks a little bit more context into some of the thinking behind this act, but once again, I'm a <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9595.857s">glad</a> that folks are my colleague is bringing it forward and bring some attention to this bill, and I support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9603.082s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9968.498s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9968.918s">I</a> think that the text of this resolution really speaks for itself, but this is something that the planning department has long recognized is, and I'd say a flaw in Medford's current <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=9985.353s">zoning</a> codes and it's one that they think could be addressed sort of in a vacuum without needing to without it substantially affecting a whole lot of other parts of the code and I think it would also be a good it would also be good to get the affordable housing trust to offer feedback for <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10011.458s">to</a> the city council if we are to update our fractional incentive policies so that they so that it could be a mechanism to actually fund the affordable housing trust but essentially essentially what this does is if you look at medford's current very simple inclusionary zoning that's it as it says in the text of the resolution they sort of have <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10037.536s">they</a> have a policy where developers from a bird's eye view to simplify it, developers can build up to nine units market rate, but then the 10th unit has to be an affordable one. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10056.605s">There's</a> that like that 10th is a 10%. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10058.947s">And</a> what this does is it means that Medford has a lot of nine unit properties because suddenly adding on the 10th one would just be a massive <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10066.791s">Josh</a> Triplett And so basically this and so essentially what this would do is it is instead of having these sort of discrete. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10082.06s">intervals</a> where suddenly between nine and 10, you suddenly get this jump from 0% affordable to 10% affordable, and then this sudden jump at the 24 to 25 number, it would <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10103.28s">sort</a> of have it would you could actually change the policy so that you could make it so that instead of having these intervals you could actually like have the developer pay for part of an affordable unit in lieu of actually making in lieu of actually <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10119.38s">building</a> a unit that is required to be affordable as it's defined under the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10125.182s">So</a> this would basically make it so that Medford doesn't have like so many 24 or so many nine unit properties and developers wouldn't have that weird discretized incentive and also be another mechanism to fund the Affordable Housing Trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10141.726s">But</a> I figured that it would be best left up to the policy wonks that are sitting on the AHT. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10149.528s">in</a> order to recommend the specifics of what this policy is because that can vary from town to town. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10155.789s">So</a> the recommendation for this is to send out a request to the AHT asking them to develop a recommendation for how to change this policy that could then be considered in the administration and finance committee where I would also motion to refer this paper to. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10180.657s">Councilor</a> Callahan.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10209.497s">Yeah,</a> my logic for that was that planning and permitting seemed to be pretty busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10216.519s">But</a> no, I'd accept that, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10218.879s">Got</a> some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10220.1s">Got</a> some time available. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10224.661s">Yeah,</a> so motion to, I'll go ahead and amend it in motion to refer to the planning and permitting committee instead.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10809.208s">Just</a> a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10809.689s">If</a> you <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10814.522s">Do</a> you know of any other precedent or specific instances of churches having their 513C status revoked for stuff like this? <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10826.967s">I</a> remember the Westboro Baptist Church was in the news for a couple of years for doing stuff like this, but I never really looked into whether they got in trouble with the IRS.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10921.458s">I</a> don't, I don't, I don't know why, why they do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10923.799s">I</a> mean, they have prime real estate and they put up out a number of inflammatory messages. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10929.402s">They</a> went to the pride fest, like the Medford's some, some Medford pride events and literally had a fellow out there with a megaphone shouting things across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10945.857s">It's</a> sad. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10946.358s">There's</a> like a, when I went to college, there's this guy, I remember UNC Chapel Hill, he was called a pit preacher, and he just, this guy just used to come in the middle of campus and just say the most <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10963.114s">horrific</a> things to college students. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10965.135s">And</a> it was just something that he just did all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10967.875s">He</a> would quote the Bible while he was doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10971.516s">I</a> think he did it to get people's attention, to get a rise out of them, to try to, you know, get attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10978.677s">I</a> don't know if that's the strategy, if that's what this church is going for. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10986.959s">I</a> think it is not a <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10993.258s">It's</a> something that makes residents feel scared, and I wish they would stop doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10997.039s">But</a> this does fall under. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=10998.48s">But</a> yeah, that's all I'll say. <a href="https://youtu.be/rNW_qqbEEfU&t=11003.282s">It</a> doesn't make me happy.<h2><a href="../2025-08-28_og30Vvr2J5c/2025-08-28_og30Vvr2J5c.html">Medford City Council Candidate Forum 2025</a></h2>
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=776.74s">First,</a> I'd like to thank the Democratic City Committee for hosting this event. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=781.023s">My</a> name is Matt Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=782.184s">I'm</a> a scientist, a naval officer, and for the past two years, a city councilor in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=787.809s">I</a> grew up in a military family, moved around a lot, did my PhD in the UK and moved to Medford as a postdoc at Mass General. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=794.133s">When</a> I moved here, I could barely pay for a room in a small apartment. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=798.457s">Now,</a> that's not because brain disease research is not valuable. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=802.54s">It's</a> because something about the system is deeply flawed. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=806.483s">In</a> the past 30 years, U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=807.863s">rents</a> have risen 323%, average home prices 441%, and median household income a mere 37%. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=815.985s">And</a> to even begin addressing this, we need to start locally. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=819.806s">So</a> in 2023, after lobbying council to pass an affordable housing trust, I ran for council myself, talked to a whole lot of people, and began serving in 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=831.32s">Our</a> state has laws that prevent city budgets from keeping up with inflation and Medford has stagnated in its growth for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=837.944s">So</a> Medford has a budget problem and Medford's housing is too expensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=843.086s">This</a> past term, I and many of my colleagues on council have stopped kicking the can down the road and backed by many parents and young families in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=851.211s">We</a> put on the ballot and campaign for our city's first ever 2.5 override, which staved 40 union jobs in the Medford Teachers Association and funded a full-time road repair crew. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=861.334s">This</a> past term, council approved new public housing for seniors, and I'm working at the state and local level to fund our new affordable housing trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=868.763s">The</a> city and the community spent years developing plans to rezone the city, both to address our affordability crisis and dwindling budget, and council is working on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=878.015s">Our</a> current zoning is patchwork. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=879.276s">It</a> leads to patchwork development. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=880.537s">It</a> needs to change, and it's needed to change for a very long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=884.499s">New</a> zoning will mitigate traffic via transportation demand management program, mandate greener building practices, and with an historic conversion ordinance, maintain the many historic buildings that compose Medford, all while incentivizing housing affordability. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=898.988s">I've</a> made Council a more transparent body by instituting a City Council newsletter, live-streaming our meetings, holding office hours at the Medford Senior Center, and writing about all of it non-stop on my website. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=909.569s">I</a> instituted a first-of-its-kind program to house low-income veterans, and I passed a law that will allow Medford residents to voluntarily donate to an in-need veterans fund on their tax bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=919.392s">In</a> January, Council passed a welcoming city ordinance, and in my work with the Democratic City Committee, I spearheaded a campaign to inform non-English-speaking residents of their constitutional rights in these very dire times. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=932.269s">In</a> short, Council has at long last stopped kicking the can down the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=935.391s">We</a> need to take action if we're to have an affordable and vibrant city. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=938.513s">I've</a> been putting in the work to do just that, and I will continue to put in the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=943.135s">Thank</a> you very much for your time and attention, and don't forget to vote on September 16th.<h2><a href="../2025-08-06_cZff0fmztDw/2025-08-06_cZff0fmztDw.html">City Council 08-05-25</a></h2>
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=1183.754s">Find</a> the records in order and move to approve.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=14829.77s">Yeah,</a> this has been a tricky one for me because last year when the ceasefire resolution came up, I voted present for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=14839.236s">And</a> when another resolution came up that also directly mentioned the conflict, I also voted present. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=14847.94s">even</a> for the motion to table that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=14850.121s">This</a> is a bit of a tricky. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=14852.582s">This</a> one's a little bit trickier for me, because it doesn't actually, as President Bears just mentioned, it doesn't actually mention any one country specifically. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=14864.128s">So</a> somebody was coming up and saying, well, why can't we divest from China, for instance, because they're detaining the Uighur Muslims? <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=14875.453s">that</a> actually is something that can be done under the framework of this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=14882.237s">I</a> also asked about the option of potentially severing parts of it, but that's not a thing that really can be done for ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=14897.307s">So</a> just going by the text of the ordinance itself, I don't think that it <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=14905.717s">does</a> explicitly target any... I see this as more of a long-term thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=14911.721s">I</a> don't think it explicitly targets any one company, any one country, although the rhetoric around it has been, of course, very different from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=14927.013s">And</a> so that's something that I've been personally struggling with. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=14933.117s">Sometimes</a> it's said that <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=14935.208s">Perception</a> is reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=14936.489s">I</a> don't really believe in that quote. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=14941.011s">I</a> try to vote on what is in the text right in front of me. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=14944.452s">And</a> what's in the text right in front of me is a general framework that includes divesting from a number of different companies over a number of different reasons without mentioning any one in particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=14959.359s">A</a> lot of presidents disagree on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=14963.157s">A</a> lot of very often people will come into these chambers and make a judgment based on and project their own personal experiences onto the text that needs to be voted on. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=14978.687s">And</a> I respect that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=14981.448s">I</a> mean, there's a few other things specifically. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=14984.55s">Like</a> even though I'm <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=14993.136s">member</a> of the military. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=14995.197s">I</a> mean, I remember what Eisenhower said about the US going into the military-industrial complex, and I very much think the country has gone in that direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=15007.086s">Defense</a> contractors get a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=15014.112s">I</a> do also appreciate Council President Bears's efforts to strengthen, to make more specific 2D as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=15028.196s">I</a> think the specificity does help to add a framework to this ordinance, and I do a framework to that decision making that investors have to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=15040.539s">And</a> I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=15043.971s">When</a> it comes to folks saying things like, well, we need to delay, we need more time. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=15051.293s">I</a> very often hear those excuses in this chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=15056.175s">People</a> say we need to slow down all the time if they just don't really support something. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=15060.756s">This</a> has been in the works for months. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=15062.817s">And</a> if the mayor or chief of staff sends an email a few hours before the meeting with this whole litany of concerns, that basically just means that they <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=15073.26s">want</a> to delay the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=15074.98s">If</a> that email were sent a week ago, I would have a lot more respect for it, but we frequently get these laundry lists of concerns just before a meeting, and it's a delay tactic. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=15086.823s">I</a> think there were one or two things in it that are worth considering, but those can be considered more appropriately in between the first and third reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=15101.441s">just</a> want folks to know that those are my thoughts on it because I haven't really spoken and I have been earnestly thinking about everything that everybody said here tonight and in the past two meetings before this and I thank you all for your time.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=18390.584s">Yeah,</a> the wisdom that I've gained on my one term thus far in city council, what I've learned is that pretty much everything about this position incentivizes you to do nothing because anytime you make a <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=18408.308s">make</a> a decision, it'll anger somebody. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=18410.83s">I</a> was just at an event right before I came here, and a city councilor in another city said a quote, which I think I'm going to start using now, and I'm going to steal it from him. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=18424.32s">He</a> said, the only thing people hate worse than a problem is a solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=18430.325s">And</a> I think that that summed it up very well. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=18435.288s">Everything</a> about this job incentivizes us to say nice things to residents, to tell them what they want to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=18444.133s">Nothing</a> about this job incentivizes us to actually make a decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=18448.095s">The</a> overrides were a decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=18451.257s">It</a> was our decision to put that on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=18452.918s">It</a> was the decision of the rest of the city to vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=18457.865s">people</a> that many people who voted on it were on a fixed income, and it put an extra burden on them, but it ended up saving 40 teaching jobs and invested in a road crew that will end up repairing the streets at a faster rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=18480.593s">It</a> is <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=18482.07s">very</a> hard to actually do something productive. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=18485.412s">It's</a> very hard to build something. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=18488.893s">It's</a> very easy to throw a wrench into the clockwork and try to stop everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=18495.837s">And</a> it's easy to do that if you have the resources to make robo calls and send out emails to a wide portion of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=18508.082s">It's</a> much easier to do that than it is to actually <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=18511.684s">build</a> something. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=18513.205s">So</a> another thing I'll say is that, you know, people, people in local elected office, we tend to just doing this stuff, you tend to learn, learn a lot of technical details, like the fact that we didn't just have one q&a session we had, there were like six, and they're like, five of them are on YouTube right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=18533.193s">Like</a> the fact that during the when we adopted 11 out of 12 of the proposals from the Salem Street, <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=18542.31s">a</a> huge number of residents were literally asking us to do just that, that evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=18548.334s">So</a> it's little technical details that most people don't know, but we're aware of that you could just sort of ignore when you're making a narrative. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=18557.08s">And</a> it's very easy to just not actually be honest about those little details when you're telling people. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=18566.96s">what's</a> going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=18567.801s">And</a> what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=18570.424s">And</a> you know, I'm, I mean, I, I live on Salem Street, I'm talking to a lot of my neighbors on Salem Street, a lot of them, a lot of them like the rezoning, a lot of them didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=18581.817s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=18582.638s">A</a> lot of them appreciate what I said during council meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=18587.501s">A</a> lot of them thought that I could have could have phrased it differently and I appreciate all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=18593.224s">I'm</a> sending out a press release, telling a legislative body to undo. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=18599.827s">things</a> that have already been ordained as asinine, that is not an approach of somebody who is working in good faith. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=18609.169s">I</a> don't appreciate that game of chicken. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=18613.469s">I</a> understand that Council President Bears's speech that he gave out to the city, it was sort of a public way to, it was sort of like a public way for council to <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=18628.467s">express</a> what our path forward was. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=18630.088s">I</a> think the response to that, especially if you read the whole thing, was not any sort of an olive branch. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=18636.531s">It</a> was a middle finger in response to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=18638.771s">And</a> the fact that it was done two days after nomination papers closed and the mayor knew she wouldn't have to run against anybody was like an extra cherry on top of that sundae. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=18654.238s">So</a> yeah, there's a lot that can be said about this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=18658.221s">I've</a> heard the different narratives thrown around time and time again. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=18661.744s">It</a> gets repetitive after a while, but I always appreciate talking to residents about what's happening with <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=18674.05s">the</a> rezoning, I understand that there's a lot more work that needs to be done in coming up with a vision that the highest number of people can agree on. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=18683.016s">And</a> I look forward to engaging in that process in good faith. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=18691.683s">So</a> thank you for everybody who's listening at 12 in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=18695.846s">And</a> I'm gonna shut up now.

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=3116.418s">So</a> instead of not requiring residency for the youth members, I think it might be better to add in a line about <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=3130.248s">basically</a> if a member moves away and they have less than X number of months on their term, they're not automatically removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=3143.453s">They</a> can serve out the remainder of their term remotely if they so choose. <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=3150.676s">I</a> think that kind of language would be a little bit more <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=3155.541s">would</a> cover the situation that Sarah described just now a little bit better.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=3227.301s">I</a> personally just feel like not requiring residency for the youth members at all is a little bit, could be a little bit odd.

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1dIxixg8FHg&t=3368.377s">Let's</a> see, maybe at the last sentence of 2A, the youth members, maybe just residency is not required for the youth members as long as they are enrolled in educational institutions based in Medford.<h2><a href="../2025-07-16_Ig6AP1vJ1-8/2025-07-16_Ig6AP1vJ1-8.html">City Council 07-15-25</a></h2>

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7624.47s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7624.851s">I</a> fully support this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7627.433s">I'd</a> just like to comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7628.434s">Sometimes,</a> as many folks here have been witnessing for the first hour and a half of this meeting, we discuss very dry topics that are nonetheless very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7638.775s">to</a> the to the city, transfer of funds, talk about zoning, but resolutions like these are also important because people want to know where their elected officials, where their city stands, and the morale of the city is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7656.372s">Now</a> having people feel safe is very important and so <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7661.877s">It</a> is possible that sometimes you might be in a position where you can overdo symbolic gestures. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7669.122s">I</a> don't think that this is one of those cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7672.004s">It</a> is important for people to know what their government thinks, even in certain cases where they might not necessarily have direct power over those issues, because it does affect people's relationships with their government. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7688.196s">So</a> I would like to make that point.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15282.201s">One</a> thing I did just want to do with my with my time is that the arrest was actually recorded <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15290.683s">by</a> one of the neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15292.484s">And</a> so I'm going to try to get a clip of this that doesn't get the guy's face too closely. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15298.467s">But</a> I do feel like these arrests are usually a little bit abstract, like people only just talk about them. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15306.17s">And</a> in this case, there was a couple of ICE agents who were arresting a pizza delivery driver, which I don't really think is that great of a <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15316.762s">use</a> of anybody's time if they're trying to stop, they're trying to protect the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15324.844s">But</a> it's a little silly, but I do think that a picture is worth a thousand words. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15331.126s">And</a> this really scared the neighbors who were here earlier tonight, but had to leave when they wanted to talk about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15340.409s">And</a> I do just like to have people see a little bit of this <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15346.601s">see</a> a little bit of the footage just so that it's not quite as abstract as it normally is when we're just talking about an arrest over the weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15353.664s">So</a> thank you for listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=15358.926s">And</a> I'm not going to, again, I'm not going to show the whole clip because I did realize that in some places it shows a close-up of his face and I decided I didn't really want to do that.<h2><a href="../2025-06-22_Yqwco1gJdRs/2025-06-22_Yqwco1gJdRs.html">2025 Kickoff Speech</a></h2>
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=3.256s">I</a> gave this speech to one of my colleagues to ask for his feedback and he said it was he said it was too long <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=17.03s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=17.931s">Thank</a> you for coming out here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=19.171s">You</a> could have spent this very cloudy Saturday doing anything else, but you came out to listen to one of your local elected officials talk about what's going on in the city and listen to their vision for the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=30.997s">So</a> everyone here represents the most dedicated and involved residents in the city, and I'm grateful to be in this community with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=38.205s">First</a> of all, I'm just going to do the formality and recognize the elected officials that are with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=42.167s">There</a> is City Councilor Zach, what was your last name? <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=50.292s">City</a> Council President Zach Baird, City Councilor Emily Lazzaro, School Committee, City Councilor Anna Callahan, School Committee Member Paul Russo, Jenny Graham, and John Intapa. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=61.799s">Is</a> anybody else in the crowd? <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=66.142s">Yep,</a> I believe that's everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=69.09s">My</a> name is Matt Leming, I've been a city council for one term and I'm running for a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=72.5s">Two</a> years ago, I promised transparency, I promised to address Medford's. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=77.848s">I</a> promise to invest in more affordable housing to address the housing crisis that this whole country is experiencing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=83.772s">So</a> what have we done over the past two years? <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=87.674s">This</a> past city council term has objectively been the most productive that Medford has seen in a generation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=94.557s">With</a> the help of many parents and volunteers, many of whom are here today, we invested in our public school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=101.481s">We</a> joined the 94% of other Massachusetts cities that passed an override and in doing so we saved 40 teaching jobs and got the funding to hire a dedicated crew to patch up our roads and sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=115.192s">And</a> we recognize that that can be a tax burden on many of us, which is why we're now completely rezoning the city for the first time in almost 40 years to bring in more commercial revenue, to let us build more affordable housing, to mandate greener building practices, while preserving the green spaces and historic buildings that characterize our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=132.49s">All</a> while being more transparent than any other council before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=136.971s">Every</a> single month, we meet in council to summarize our accomplishments in a newsletter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=143.513s">And</a> not everybody has regular computer access, so every single month we go to the senior center just to listen to their concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=150.815s">We</a> set up a trust to fund affordable housing projects and initiative, which I've been working painstakingly to fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=156.677s">And</a> I worked to institute a first of its kind program to house veteran renters. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=162.297s">Because</a> of our historic failure to build and welcome new businesses in Medford, we became one of the most underfunded cities per capita in the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=170.139s">But</a> now we're one of the fastest growing cities, the budget is healthier and healthier, and at the local level, things are looking up and I have nothing but hope for the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=182.501s">But</a> we are living in a strange time where that's not the case nationally. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=189.003s">The</a> country isn't doing well as a whole because of so many people who feel left out and feel isolated, who felt so disconnected and contemptuous of the way things were going that they elected what we have today. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=202.712s">We</a> have a president who's throwing himself a birthday parade a week after sending their Marines in the National Guard to scare and agitate protesters. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=209.037s">Around</a> Boston, federal agents in masks have been abducting our neighbors off the streets and trying to sow fear in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=216.301s">And</a> going off script a little bit, <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=219.063s">wrote</a> this a few days ago and even since then we've had some troubling international developments as well as the recent assassination of a local elected official in the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=238.901s">We've</a> had destructive economic <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=242.919s">Destructive</a> economic policies that only benefit a handful, or your person at the top who's dismantling the federal government as fast as humanly possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=251.302s">So</a> many of us have taken refuge in local government, and we're doing everything we can to push back. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=256.644s">We're</a> working with Luce to report the whereabouts of ICE agents. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=259.865s">This</a> past term, I worked to make Medford into a sanctuary city with the help of my colleagues so that the Medford Police Department doesn't work with ICE on non-criminal matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=270.349s">With</a> the Democratic City Committee, I spearheaded a campaign to teach migrant communities their rights to keep them safer, while others in City Hall have held sessions with local migrant communities to teach them their rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=283.655s">But</a> it wasn't me who distributed the red cards personally, it was the many non-profits who we gave them to so that they could hand them out to migrants. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=290.279s">It</a> wasn't City Council who campaigned and voted to invest in our roads and schools, it was the community who did that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=296.443s">And</a> it's not City Council who's supporting the rezoning effort, it's the community who comes out and speaks about it at the many, many meetings we have on the topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=305.237s">Councilors</a> can only work because there are so many people in the city, so many of you who care enough to make a difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=311.138s">Without</a> your support, we cannot do anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=315.379s">And</a> I know that for a fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=316.74s">When</a> I first moved to Medford, I was an underpaid scientist in a very expensive place that nonetheless had a lot of job opportunities in my field. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=325.402s">I</a> got involved in affordable housing activism pretty quickly, lobbying the city council at the time to institute an affordable housing trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=335.006s">Shortly</a> thereafter, a few members of that council encouraged me to run for a seat. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=340.727s">Back</a> then, I think I was elected for three reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=343.447s">First,</a> there were three open seats that year, which is quite a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=347.548s">Second,</a> that's true. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=350.969s">Second,</a> I wasn't vague, and I didn't try to center myself on every issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=356.95s">I</a> didn't necessarily try to be friends with everybody just by telling them what they wanted to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=362.191s">But</a> I made my policies and my ideals very clear and very specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=366.431s">And</a> I think that garnered trust, even among those who may have disagreed with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=371.628s">I</a> don't think everyone on this lawn agrees with every single one of my policies, but they know what they are because I've written about them on the internet every two weeks for the past two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=382.178s">The</a> third reason I was elected my first go-around and the most important is that I knocked on around 8,000 doors and I had a lot of conversations with a lot of different people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=391.186s">Now</a> speaking to as many people as I did, I learned a few things about Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=396.792s">We're</a> a city with a lot of young people and a lot of old people, a lot of renters and a lot of homeowners, a lot of multi-generational residents who can trace their lineage back to the Mayflower, and a lot of people who only arrived very recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=413.098s">And</a> we all call Medford home. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=416.079s">And</a> just to speak, people I spoke to came from so many different backgrounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=420.041s">When</a> people talked about city council, I got so many different responses. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=425.02s">Some</a> often knew the city councilors well, grew up with them, could talk about their high school years and knew their electives on a first name basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=432.482s">But</a> other times they talked about how they just felt excluded from local politics altogether. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=437.784s">Some</a> people moved here for school and they wanted to get involved in their city, but couldn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=441.465s">People</a> who lived here 20, 30 years raised families and were still called New Medford in a pejorative way. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=447.207s">You</a> couldn't get the time of day from local politicians unless they'd grown up with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=452.692s">And</a> I talked to all these people, I listened to all of them equally. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=455.035s">And</a> I did my best to bring them into the fold, even if they might have disagreed with some of my policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=460.903s">And</a> I know that my colleagues did the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=463.486s">I</a> think that's one of the reasons we've seen so many changes in the city over the past few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=467.981s">Council</a> used to be an old boys club, but then new candidates connected with so many people who felt left out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=473.444s">So</a> we elected a city council and school committee that brought new blood and new ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=478.787s">We</a> brought a mindset that didn't just recognize Medford's problems, talk about them, and stop there, but approached issues with curiosity and proposed specific, concrete policies to solve them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=490.273s">And</a> because of this new energy, these past two years have been the most productive we've had in generations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=501.332s">Medford's</a> future. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=502.834s">And</a> no, nothing is totally fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=505.217s">There</a> are still potholes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=506.258s">We</a> still lack after-school programs for young families. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=508.721s">We</a> still lack housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=509.703s">We</a> still lack options for many seniors who might want to downsize. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=513.307s">It</a> takes more than a few years to make up for the systemic underfunding of our infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=518.493s">Because</a> for longer than I've been alive, we've been in a system that's focused not on the growth of our cities, not on investing in our workers, but on focusing wealth at the top, not on empowering the younger generations, but on putting us into debt, not on maintaining our infrastructure and investing in our education, but on short-term gains. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=538.31s">We're</a> not there yet, but make no mistake, this council, this local government has been busy laying the foundation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=545.997s">So</a> there's a long road ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=547.999s">We</a> need to build on that foundation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=549.38s">We</a> need to address the historic housing shortage. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=551.601s">We</a> need to help the DBW fix our roads so that they don't fall into further disrepair. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=556.505s">We</a> need to make sure our rezoning is taken advantage of so that we have the funding to do all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=561.348s">This</a> next term on council, we need to keep up the momentum. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=565.571s">I'm</a> almost done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=577.283s">Yeah,</a> I'm almost done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=578.683s">First</a> of all, we're doing well not because of me or my colleagues, but because of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=583.124s">The</a> people who have chosen to make their communities here, who have chosen to talk to their neighbors, and who have chosen to make Medford as welcoming as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=591.666s">In</a> 1961, JFK said, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=596.747s">He</a> said that because the more people contribute to their community, the more their community can give back. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=603.655s">I'm</a> hopeful for Medford's future because of all the people who do so much to give back. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=607.82s">The</a> many people who organize their neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=610.103s">I'm</a> hopeful because of the volunteers who chose to sink time into knocking doors and talk to their neighbors so that we can invest in the next generation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=618.132s">I'm</a> hopeful because of the political organizers working to defend our neighbors from federal overreach. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=622.717s">I'm</a> hopeful because of every person who sunk their own free time into a board or commission or church or community activist group or political campaign without pay so that Medford can have a better future. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=632.841s">It's</a> because of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=635.282s">City</a> councillors like myself are only one small part of the equation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=638.863s">And</a> as I conclude this speech, one paragraph. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=643.254s">As</a> I conclude this speech, I have an ask of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=646.495s">Sorry,</a> you knew this was coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=648.635s">Running</a> a campaign is not cheap. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=651.976s">One</a> mailer to the voters of Medford costs around $7,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=655.537s">Volunteers,</a> website, cost, staff, all of this is needed for a campaign and the sum total usually goes to about $20,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=662.738s">But</a> a donation to a local political campaign is not an expense, it's an investment in your community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=668.189s">Now,</a> not everybody's in a financial position to donate. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=670.25s">I</a> get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=670.89s">But</a> in your presence here today is really more than I could have asked for, and I'm grateful. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=675.771s">But</a> if you're able, I print out a few QR codes around here, which gives a link to the donation spot on my website. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=681.753s">And</a> I've set up a little box for checks if you'd like to donate that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=685.935s">Additionally,</a> I'd also like to say, be on the lookout for the other wonderful city council and school committee candidates as they come up in the near future as the campaign season gets rolling. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=697.734s">Thank</a> you so much for listening to me and thank you so much for coming out here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqwco1gJdRs&t=701.184s">I'm</a> truly glad to have everybody out here.<h2><a href="../2025-06-11_aDOHyHAgxKE/2025-06-11_aDOHyHAgxKE.html">City Council Planning and Permitting Committee 06-11-25</a></h2>
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aDOHyHAgxKE&t=3124.885s">So</a> can you clarify the bit on TDM being a midterm change? <a href="https://youtu.be/aDOHyHAgxKE&t=3130.91s">So</a> I understand a study does need to be done for it, but in the research that you've done on it so far, what do you find is the relationship between the part of it that's incorporated into zoning and the part of it that the study needs to account for?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aDOHyHAgxKE&t=3191.333s">Okay,</a> so you're mainly referring to <a href="https://youtu.be/aDOHyHAgxKE&t=3195.095s">developers</a> being integrated into the lower Mystic TMA?<h2><a href="../2025-06-10_a519TYOBRJE/2025-06-10_a519TYOBRJE.html">City Council 06-10-25</a></h2>
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=1234.835s">We</a> drafted our monthly newsletter and released it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=1239.179s">Thank</a> you to Councilor Lazzaro for putting the work into doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=1243.803s">We</a> discussed the results and feedback from some of the recent senior center listening sessions, which Councilor Lazzaro and Councilor Tseng attended. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=1255.933s">and</a> we heard Councilor Tseng's presentation on the budget survey as well as the report that he prepared and voted to release that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=1265.857s">Motion</a> to approve.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=4017.983s">One,</a> when the police are presenting the budget, I specifically asked them if they're capable of executing this ordinance, providing periodic reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=4027.805s">They</a> said they're working towards that, but it was doable. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=4030.505s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=4032.226s">Two,</a> saying that the input of the police chief is, well, using that as an excuse that you kind of go back to for not supporting these things, it's just something that <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=4046.098s">We've</a> heard time and time again. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=4047.178s">I</a> mean, last time I heard a lack of support for this, for a surveillance report, because supposedly it wasn't, didn't get the approval of the police chief when it had actually been written by the police chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=4062.862s">So</a> I don't think that that's a reason to not do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=4065.203s">Third,</a> we've had the thoughts and prayers, like language coming out of <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=4073.685s">local</a> politicians for the longest time and I just don't think it's satisfactory. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=4077.888s">Okay,</a> this is a very basic minimal response, but it is something, and people don't want to keep hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=4087.153s">Oh,</a> I'm very concerned I'm knitting my eyebrows for people in this community who are being abducted by ice and shipped off to El Salvador. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=4095.701s">but</a> they have my thoughts and prayers, but I can't support the minimal legislation possible to actually do something about that or even make them feel more safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=4106.507s">So</a> I just, it's an excuse. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=4109.568s">I</a> mean, the welcoming city ordinance is something that's been passed by multiple other cities in the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=4116.712s">It's</a> been passed by many other states. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=4118.853s">It</a> is the least that we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=4122.715s">And</a> this is, <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=4124.212s">Another,</a> like an after action report showing where ICE was in the community is also the least that we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=4133.277s">People</a> are feeling unsafe right now and they wanna know that the police department has their back, is there for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=4141.782s">And</a> this ordinance or this resolution gives them a framework to let them know that they can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=4148.686s">That's</a> all I have to say.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=5934.88s">No,</a> I was just going to say what I mean, meetings are every two weeks.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=6320.447s">Thank</a> you for the resolution, Vice President Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=6324.77s">One</a> small point I'd like to make, and I'm not going to generally go into how horrifying this development is, but one thing I would like to point out about this situation is that the <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=6343.292s">Marines</a> that were sent in, 700 Marines, are not trained for crowd control. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=6350.215s">And</a> that's an important thing for people to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=6354.117s">The</a> police department, when you have a local police force, they're trained to protect a group of people within a town or a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=6366.983s">Marines</a> are trained to go into <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=6370.898s">a</a> hostile territory and they are trained to kill. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=6373.925s">That</a> is what they are taught to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=6377.152s">They</a> are not taught <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=6379.488s">to</a> do any sort of crowd control, quell protests, they are taught to kill. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=6384.432s">That</a> is what they're used for. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=6385.914s">They</a> are a military force that you send into a war zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=6388.816s">And</a> when I read that 700 Marines were being sent into Los Angeles, that was <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=6402.598s">That</a> was particularly chilling. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=6405.839s">And</a> that's not even saying anything about the national guardsmen that are there right now, standing there without orders, without a place to sleep, without a place to eat. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=6419.824s">That's</a> not to mention the $134 million that this whole operation has costed. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=6427.95s">It's</a> sad. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=6428.951s">It's</a> not. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=6431.695s">The</a> military should not be used against protesters. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=6438.284s">That's</a> all I have to say.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10548.14s">So</a> at the beginning of this year, we had about $28 million in free cash, and we're seeing here the updated version was $22.12 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10559.205s">So</a> at the beginning of the year, Medford had, as a percentage of its operating budget, <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10566.737s">48%.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10566.797s">That</a> amount of free cash is 14.48% of the operating budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10570.078s">Now</a> that it's 22.12, it's like 11.3%. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10570.999s">The</a> average across the Commonwealth is 9.4% across all of the 351 cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10573.38s">So</a> Medford in terms of <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10588.786s">At</a> the beginning of the year, we ranked about number 44 in terms of cities that had free cash as a percentage of operating budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10596.734s">So</a> pretty high, but not like necessarily an outlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10600.598s">Right</a> now, considering the $22.12 million that we have remaining, we could spend about <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10610.127s">$3.7</a> million right off the bat and be right at the average of the other cities in the Commonwealth as of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10618.532s">So</a> yeah, $3.7 million could be spent immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10624.695s">And</a> there are some parts of the operating budget I was noticing as well where you're sort of over budgeting for certain positions with the <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10634.503s">you</a> know, idea that that would be with the with the idea that we should have that many positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10640.846s">But</a> for instance, the police department, they were saying that they had 90, I believe, just going off memory, it was 93. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10649.45s">They</a> currently have they said three, an extra three were in the pilot pipeline, we're budgeting for 107. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10653.933s">And</a> there were some other parts of the budget that were <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10657.358s">similar</a> to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10657.998s">So</a> there's going to be more like, I assume that some of a lot of those unfilled positions are just going to be going into free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10663.76s">So,</a> you know, getting us down to that average, like an extra four or $5 million a year, it's not going to, I don't think it's necessarily going to solve every one of the city's problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10676.545s">What</a> I personally like to see it spent on is areas where we <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10680.726s">know</a> that it will lead to some sort of growth in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10684.029s">I</a> do appreciate what I see on the next paper, which is some of those funding for some of the studies that I mentioned, which would at least allow the city to put out like starting bids on some of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10698.022s">But</a> echoing what some of my colleagues have said, Medford does have a lot of needs right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10703.426s">And</a> I do appreciate any areas that you could identify where we could sort of like <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10709.633s">fund</a> those, and that would lead to excessive growth in the future, which is kind of the parts that I've been trying to focus on during this term in terms of things like updating our linkage fees, which would lead to a lot more money in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10726.819s">Again,</a> I keep talking about this TDM study, which is, I would say, partially funded on this next paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10733.822s">Speaking</a> as one Councilor, I do like to see areas where we're spending free cash, which do promise pretty substantial growth in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10742.169s">So</a> those parts are very appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10744.712s">That's</a> all I have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10745.753s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10800.743s">mainly</a> monetary growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10802.304s">Like</a> I do like to see the budget that we have be in a healthier state. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10809.927s">So</a> that was what I was referring to when I said that just now. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10812.909s">I</a> do appreciate what my colleague, Councilor Callahan was just saying about trying to also put the money towards those areas where if we don't, <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10827.475s">If</a> we don't fix them now it'll just end up the cost will just end up skyrocketing to fix them in the future, which, in my mind, also relates to the monetary growth issue because patching up those areas will end up saving us money. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10844.703s">like</a> 10, 20 years down the line when it does end up getting torn up. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10849.305s">So</a> that's the way I'm thinking about this is where can we apply money now so that the overall picture will be better 20 years in the future and we're not spending even more money than we normally would like fixing up a ton of roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10864.45s">So</a> I do appreciate that distinction, but to me, it's sort of like they're one in the same in a lot of ways.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10940.509s">Right,</a> so we were, I mean we, we were one of the very few. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10946.002s">municipalities</a> that didn't already have some sort of a stabilization fund beforehand. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10949.663s">So</a> the data that I was referring to, I just took from the Massachusetts State website, and it offers a breakdown of free cash from other municipalities this past year. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10960.907s">So</a> it didn't <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10962.828s">specify</a> the size of the various stabilization funds in those cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10968.474s">But</a> I'm also going with the assumption that those cities already had stabilization funds that Medford, for some reason, didn't for years and years beforehand. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10980.387s">But</a> you are correct that that data is <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=10983.911s">available</a> somewhere on the website, I would just have to pull it up and do some Excel macro magic to to get a get a better get a better picture of those of those percentages.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=12816.689s">like</a> to echo my colleague's views on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=12819.11s">I</a> am glad and I'm glad to see the funding for the Nexus studies that we've been asking for for a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=12829.013s">Just</a> to clarify to anybody watching City Council meetings at 1024 in the evening, these studies are going to be used by the Planning Department to put out bids to <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=12845.317s">outside</a> firms who will determine the amount that we need to raise our linkage fees to the modern day. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=12853.87s">Now,</a> the linkage fees are the amount of money that we charge developers as a city who might want to <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=12861.582s">so</a> that we can put funding towards our roads, our police and fire, our parks, and our water and sewer lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=12869.834s">And</a> more recently, we have an ordinance going through to put linkage fees towards affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=12877.164s">Now</a> these amounts have not been updated since the 1990s. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=12882.067s">So</a> they've basically been eaten by inflation this whole time, even though it was the responsibility of the city to update these every three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=12890.313s">It's</a> just, we got in the habit of not doing that ever since they were first instituted. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=12894.755s">So</a> this is a area where the city is just hemorrhaging money. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=12899.659s">And</a> this very small investment is a way to stop doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=12907.363s">the</a> they will allow us to figure out how much we should be charging these developers because so far we've been really we really haven't been doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=12916.375s">The</a> other the other part of this is the transportation demand management study. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=12922.663s">which</a> will allow the city to essentially integrate with the Mystic Valley TMA to create incentives for local developers to put money towards things like buses to allow more local transportation within Medford, as well as a number of other benefits that being included in those regional developer networks will bring to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=12949.832s">$100,000</a> may not necessarily be enough to fund all of these studies, but it will allow the planning office to start putting out bids in order to get that back. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=12962.061s">And</a> so we might have to, we might be put in a position where we'll have to approve more funding for them in the future, depending on what prices they get back from consultants. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=12971.689s">But</a> in any case, I'd like to thank the city for putting this in front of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=12975.572s">And</a> that's all I have to say.

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=90.076s">Well,</a> my default is always Oasis Cafe. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=93.659s">That</a> has been my default. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=94.879s">But</a> I recently moved from South Medford to the Salem Street area where I live. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=104.867s">Right</a> next, I have a beautiful view of the 93 Rotary. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=108.189s">So</a> I still love <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=110.973s">drinking</a> my cup of coffee at Oasis Cafe, but I've also been frequenting Tom Yum Kung Thai restaurant where I eat a lot of their tofu pad Thai, especially just for like a takeout option or just before council meetings.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=146.043s">Sure,</a> so I was first elected in 2023, took office in 2024, so I'm on my first term so far. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=154.626s">This</a> past city council has been incredibly productive and it's been a real privilege to be a part of that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=163.469s">I'm</a> just going to try to touch on a couple of things that where I feel like <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=168.651s">There</a> are some things that I feel like I was the one of the main driving forces behind and others where it was really more of a team effort so the some of the most significant uh developments were the prop 2.5 override effort which where we did end up passing medford's first ever override which put uh that put uh seven million dollars into the medford public school system and five hundred thousand dollars in the department of public works which <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=197.411s">uh,</a> did end up saving about 40 teacher jobs and end up putting some very much needed investments into our school systems. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=204.656s">And</a> it will allow us to fix up the, the $500,000 to the DPW will allow us to fix up the potholes in our roads at a faster rate than we were before. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=216.243s">So</a> I try to be honest with people. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=218.144s">Like</a> it's not like that was a $500,000 a year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=220.726s">It's</a> a magical, uh, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=223.888s">fix</a> all for Medford's 60M plus backlog of road repairs, but when the DPW does hire those 3 extra road repair crew members, it will be pretty significant. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=234.913s">The</a> other major project, and yeah, I'm sorry to be clear, I was pretty involved in the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=242.496s">override</a> effort just in the background in terms of just volunteer coordination. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=246.017s">But</a> that was a pretty big effort to get that passed back in November. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=250.619s">So</a> I'm very proud of all the all the parents and other electeds who were involved in that effort. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=257.041s">The</a> biggest project that we've been involved in is just a complete citywide rezoning as well, which has been going on this entire time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=272.046s">I</a> would say that the Chair of the Planning and Permitting Committee, Kit Collins, as well as the Council President, Zach Bears, are the ones who definitely have their head on the whole in that project of anybody in City Council. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=289.253s">I've</a> been pretty involved as well as the Vice Chair of the Planning and Permitting Committee, just in terms of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=295.355s">certain</a> developments like ADUs, the upcoming transportation demand management program, and some of the aspects to do with affordable housing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=304.322s">But</a> essentially, Medford hasn't updated its zoning in several decades. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=309.185s">And</a> as a result, we have a very piecemeal zoning with a lot of non-conforming structures within the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=315.89s">It's</a> very confusing anytime a developer wants to come in and build anything new. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=323.096s">And</a> the rezoning will allow one for it to be a lot easier for developers to build new things. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=334.971s">It'll</a> make it easier for businesses to come in. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=340.432s">allow</a> for denser housing next to some of the newer T-stops that have developed in Medford in recent years, and will allow for higher and denser buildings in some of our commercial districts. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=355.945s">So</a> trying to really bring in some more commercial revenue, particularly into the city, as well as incentives for affordable housing, which is a matter that's near and dear to my heart. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=366.574s">Um,</a> on that matter, we've like another project has also been to, like, try to develop some sort of infrastructure for affordable housing within the city and, and particularly funding it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=378.617s">And</a> that's 1 that I'm like, more of a, more of the main 1 of the main driving forces behind so. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=385.518s">In</a> before I was elected, the city voted to pass an affordable housing trust. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=390.121s">And</a> this was something that other municipalities had done in like the 90s. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=393.783s">Medford</a> had only done it, only did it like two years ago. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=397.505s">And</a> so we elected, we appointed, I believe it's seven very great, wonderful people to the trust. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=406.11s">And</a> they're just concerned with trying to find ways to fundraise for it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=409.372s">So</a> I've been involved in just, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=411.453s">uh,</a> developing Medford's, uh, trying to revamp Medford's linkage fee system, which is fees that we charge developers so that there's a continuing stream of revenue into the Affordable Housing Trust, as well as just point advocates to places where they could really help to bring that funding, uh, that funding in. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=429.265s">And</a> then there's just, uh, there's a number of, uh, smaller projects that are finishing ongoing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=433.788s">I'm</a> pretty proud of the work that I've <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=436.11s">done</a> with veterans and the veteran services director so in particular passing a first of its kind incentive program to house veteran renters where the city will give landlords cash bonuses if they rent out to eligible veterans. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=456.298s">I'm</a> working with some parents who have <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=460.5s">uh,</a> kids and teenagers with disabilities to try to implement after-school programming for, uh, their kids. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=467.125s">And</a> that's been something a few other Councilors have been involved in as well. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=472.089s">And</a> just, uh, otherwise I'm chair of the resident services and public engagement committee. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=476.412s">So</a> just a lot of outreach, a lot more outreach efforts happening and smaller things like we implemented YouTube live streaming, which was a much needed development, which made it so that people could, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=488.1s">rewatch</a> the meetings a lot faster. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=490.181s">We</a> implemented a city council newsletter which sort of gives these monthly descriptions of all the meetings that have happened within the past month. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=501.924s">In</a> my personal capacity on the campaign side, I release blog posts every two weeks and I try to be consistent about that just to sort of give my own very biased view of what's happening within this <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=522.988s">Lastly,</a> also implementing a vacant building ordinance, which is something that is still an ongoing effort of collaboration with the Chamber of Commerce on that one, but that's something where we're likely going to get to discussing it more sometime in the summer. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=536.562s">So,</a> I know that was a mouthful. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=541.595s">A</a> lot of stuff that's been happening, a lot of work that I'm very proud of, and I'm very proud of the effort that all my colleagues have put into it as well. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=550.498s">So</a> yeah, things are really looking up for the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=555.179s">We're</a> on a very nice upward slope, and I'm just very proud of what we've been doing.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=601.818s">Well,</a> it's called it's called a welcoming city ordinance, which is something that it was in effect. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=609.199s">It's</a> the same thing as a sanctuary city, although the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=614.129s">We</a> looked on the DHS's website and they didn't list us as a sanctuary city, but we passed a welcoming city ordinance, and that is the same thing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=623.636s">Essentially,</a> it means that the local police force can only cooperate with federal authorities on criminal <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=632.783s">Investigations</a> and not for arbitrary detainers for for migrants and so that was something that had been introduced before I was elected. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=648.005s">And</a> it has been the policy of the Medford Police Department for a few years now, but it wasn't enshrined in an ordinance. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=657.232s">And</a> so after November, after this last November, I sort of took a lot of that <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=667.355s">those</a> ordinance drafts that had just sort of been sitting there and not a whole lot had been done on them, and worked with the Medford People Power, which is a local citizens advocacy group, as well as some field lawyers from the ACLU and the city's representation as well, and just really tried to get that through council as fast as we could. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=693.03s">And</a> so that ended up being <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=695.631s">passed</a> through the resident services and public engagement committee and by the council. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=701.153s">Um,</a> and it was passed for third reading January 14th. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=705.795s">So</a> that was, and at the time I feel like that was about what we could do at the local level to protect ourselves from what we anticipated would be happening. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=719.76s">And</a> we were pretty much spot on, uh, with what, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=725.533s">ended</a> up happening. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=728.718s">There</a> has been constant reports of ICE just arbitrarily detaining migrants with, in many cases, without a warrant. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=739.725s">I</a> think the most high-profile instance of that was, of course, Ramesa Ozturk, the Tufts PhD student, who was detained by federal authorities and shipped off to Louisiana for penning an op-ed in a student newspaper, although she was fortunately released. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=758.262s">But</a> yeah, I mean, the story of this has really been local officials trying to do whatever we can to protect residents from what's happening at the federal level. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=773.273s">And</a> besides the Sanctuary City, well, the Welcoming City Ordinance, which, again, is effectively Sanctuary City legislation, there have been a couple of other <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=785.683s">things</a> that we've been doing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=786.984s">So</a> the city has been using its community liaisons to hold meetings with immigration lawyers for some of the migrant communities through the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=803.978s">Obviously,</a> those aren't being advertised openly on Facebook because they're not just going to tell. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=810.223s">people</a> openly, like where a group of 20 migrants are gonna be meeting. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=815.247s">So,</a> but that has been happening. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=818.389s">And</a> I've been working with the Democratic City Committee to purchase a number of red cards, which are these sort of know your rights cards that you can hand out to people, even people who don't speak English. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=836.783s">So</a> they basically it just basically just list your 4th and 5th amendment rights and if you're approached by an officer, then you can just hand that to them and they know that you're not going to respond to questions on your 5th amendment, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=851.098s">So</a> that was something that I was. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=853.035s">Pretty</a> involved with, um, as well, a lot of my colleagues have been involved in canvassing the city as well. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=859.998s">Just</a> trying to really promote some of the. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=862.719s">Loose</a> ice watches, um, so that we so that residents can. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=867.441s">Uh,</a> list where they went and where they find ice just. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=873.223s">throughout</a> the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=874.003s">Um,</a> and just let people know where that's happening. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=877.866s">There's</a> been city council meetings where we've met with the Medford police department and press them for things like, you know, uh, let us know, like give us monthly reports, uh, for where you see ice, um, which is something that is currently sort of in talks right now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=897.056s">But,</a> uh, but yeah, yeah. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=899.197s">So,</a> uh, I think we are doing <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=903.224s">What</a> we can at the local level right now, given the many constraints that we have to make residents feel feel safer.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=955.02s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=955.44s">So</a> in terms of zoning, the timeline for that, if anybody would like to look up anything about the current zoning effort, the current rezoning effort happening in Medford, it is available on the website medfordma.org slash zoning. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=972.797s">And</a> that has a lot of very detailed graphics, images, text about what is happening right now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=981.204s">We</a> are trying to get through all relevant topics by the end of June. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=989.269s">And</a> what we've been doing is sort of rezoning individual parts of the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=995.232s">So</a> Mystic Avenue was rezoned first and then the Salem Street Corridor. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1003.276s">Right</a> now, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1005.258s">Medford</a> Square and West Medford are also going through the process and we're still in planning and permitting this committee discussing Boston Avenue and Main Street and some of the other some of the other streets within the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1020.292s">The</a> major one right now that's coming up is the neighborhood and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1026.497s">Sorry,</a> the blah, blah, blah, just making sure I'm not. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1029.66s">Yes,</a> the neighborhood and urban residential zoning proposal, which is the sort of. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1034.923s">Proposal</a> that affects the. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1038.126s">Largest</a> swath of area throughout the city, it affects, like, pretty much any housing and it is. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1045.071s">Rezoning</a> parts of the city that have since had. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1050.208s">that</a> have since had like T-stops built right next to them to allow for more density in certain places. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1057.09s">So</a> the timeline for that, it should be done by September. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1061.031s">That's</a> sort of the deadline that we have with the consultants. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1064.232s">And</a> something to understand about zoning is that when you pass it, it doesn't actually change anything immediately. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1070.753s">It</a> just dictates sort of what can be changed in the future. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1077.175s">Um,</a> so it says, like, okay, this thing, like, this building at this number of stories can now be built here in the future. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1084.161s">So</a> trying to encourage developers to take up the zoning and use the incentives that we build in for, like, affordable housing or the green score that we implemented to encourage environmentally friendly buildings, trees and whatnot. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1099.072s">is</a> going to be another one project that we're interested in doing for the, that city council's interested in doing for the next term. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1110.922s">That'll</a> be a major one, just making sure that growth within the city happens as a result of the zoning that we've all put so much effort into.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1173.691s">I</a> mean, there are people who are going to be against like X, Y or Z, no matter what you do. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1183.162s">So</a> the story of Medford is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1186.032s">We</a> have been a, I would say, a stagnant community for several generations now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1192.256s">And</a> that is the result. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1194.357s">I</a> mean, there's a lot of reasons behind that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1198.46s">But</a> essentially, I'll say, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1203.928s">Local</a> politicians just couldn't agree on a particular direction to go in and usually listen to voices that said like you should not do this, or you should not go in this particular direction and the current city Councilors the current school committee members are. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1221.79s">We're</a> now in a state of mind where we're like listen, we've been listening to those voices for decades now we need to actually do something and implement some sort of change because that has been what the vast majority of people have been asking for for a long time so I've been. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1238.074s">One</a> of my strengths as a campaigner is that I tend to canvas a good amount. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1243.678s">I</a> tend to, like, I like to knock on doors a lot and talk to people. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1249.502s">And</a> so, you know, I'm aware that there was like a small, there was like a pretty vocal minority who, for instance, was against the Salem Street proposals. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1260.009s">I've,</a> in the past week, I've knocked on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1263.792s">probably</a> about 200 doors just literally around Salem Street, which is my new neighborhood. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1272.854s">You</a> know, I have run into people that I recognize from the meetings like once or like I would say two times that have expressed negative opinions about the zoning. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1284.979s">The</a> everybody else is excited about it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1288.141s">Everybody</a> else like wants to is excited for the change that they see happening or, you know, they're it's. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1295.844s">Pretty</a> typical and they're just concerned about, you know, they just want the roads to be better and they don't really care about that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1301.75s">So</a> a person in my position, it's important to not listen to. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1309.962s">I</a> wanna say chronic naysayers and try to focus on the voices that you hear that represent the vast majority of the electorate. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1322.869s">And</a> it's very easy to fall into that trap of only listening to the small, very vocal groups who make it their job to approach elected officials and make their voices heard. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1334.455s">I</a> mean, realistically, it's like the same, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1337.096s">group</a> of like 20 people that we've been hearing a lot who have been sort of very vocally and consistently opposed to this.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1371.502s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1372.642s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1373.814s">You</a> know, I think, I think like the door knocking is a very, I mean, it's just a very important step. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1379.379s">Cause</a> like, I've been in that position plenty of times where like, I see this, you know, a group of people coming to city council meetings and they're all like, in some cases they're like very opposed to whatever we're doing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1394.631s">In</a> other cases, it's like maybe half and half. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1397.093s">And</a> so just trying to like find ways to reach out to like folks as a whole, which can be, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1403.398s">very</a> difficult for a person my position to find access to, because most people are pretty normal. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1411.426s">They</a> don't show up to every single city council meeting. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1414.389s">They</a> have other things to worry about. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1416.231s">So</a> it's really my job to try to make those connections and figure out what the average person is thinking, what the average person wants.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1467.105s">I</a> mean, anything, any, any answer to that pretty much boils down to more effort on my part. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1474.928s">Like</a> it really is the situation where if you kind of become lazy in this position and you just let people, whoever decides to approach you, talk at you, you're going to run into a very narrow portion of the electorate who will <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1492.615s">it</a> is rare to hear them come up with ways forward. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1498.019s">Mostly</a> people are just saying why they're opposed to X, Y, or Z without coming up with any alternative solutions. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1502.943s">And</a> for me, that's typically a real red flag. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1508.067s">There</a> are some situations where literally everybody says you shouldn't do that, and it's a lot more voices. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1514.311s">But</a> for something like zoning, again, I just hear from the same seven or eight people. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1522.371s">In</a> terms of ways to reach out to a large number of people, nothing is perfect. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1531.497s">And</a> I've tried a lot. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1533.038s">So</a> city council has done listening sessions throughout this term. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1538.942s">And</a> that does take a lot of effort to organize. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1542.304s">But</a> the point of it is that we're working with community liaisons or just people we know to like <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1547.318s">Organize</a> a listening session with some folks within the Portuguese community or organize a listening session within folks within like the Haitian Creole community like people who. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1558.463s">Don't</a> normally make it their business to come to every, every city council meeting recently. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1565.188s">We</a> realized that a lot of our outreach and this was a problem, especially during the override campaign. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1570.051s">Like,</a> a lot of our outreach was digital and a lot of people don't get their outreach that way. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1575.835s">So</a> we've really focused on having listening sessions at the. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1580.698s">at</a> the senior center, because they tend to be a group that pays a lot of attention to what's happening at City Hall, but don't necessarily go to email or have a digital newsletter or listen to podcasts. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1596.843s">So</a> we're literally going there in person once a month and just kind of addressing the concerns of folks that we see. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1605.065s">I</a> personally think that like, you know, my website has been something that I've taken to just publishing regular thoughts. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1614.027s">I</a> just try to keep myself on a once every two weeks schedule. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1617.408s">And</a> I think that's useful for people who are either subscribed to my mailing list or just find whatever I've written about on a particular subject on Google. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1628.851s">I</a> think that's useful just because they know that, you know, their local city Councilors and being lazy their local city Councilors trying to be, you know, open about his thoughts on whichever issues. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1643.406s">But</a> yeah, it is an uphill battle. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1648.007s">I</a> think personally that the city should hire professional pollsters to look into certain issues that would cost funding. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1655.289s">Yeah,</a> that would cost a good amount of money to do consistently, but there always will be biases in this process. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1666.191s">And</a> I think it's important to recognize that, but also to not stop trying.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1757.121s">Yeah,</a> the city council composition part is, is, is a very interesting point because I think you're right like there are <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1767.058s">benefits</a> and downsides of the all-at-large system. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1771.566s">But</a> in order for an incumbent to be unseated in the current system, you would have to have seven <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1780.957s">Candidates,</a> including inevitably one new person all get more votes than a current incumbent, which has happened once or twice within the school committee for various reasons. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1793.971s">But</a> since they started recording, since like the current records that I see of city council, which only go back to 2005, I don't think it's <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1803.26s">Um,</a> I don't think it's ever happened. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1805.561s">Um,</a> but the city, I mean, the city council is also pretty significantly changed over over the years. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1813.084s">And</a> that does have to do a lot to do with that point that you said, which is that the. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1820.086s">previous</a> iterations of the city council was like and this is like reflects more of the this is like also reflective of just like the political scene within greater boston as well um it used to kind of like serve like a very narrow part of the population like i remember i spoke with a guy who's lived here most of his life but he moved here as a tufts graduate student and he tried to get involved in local politics and he said that back then <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1848.514s">people</a> wouldn't even give him the time of day unless you had like, you know, like a big family in town, or maybe if you came with a big business, but otherwise, like, like politicians, like city councilors wouldn't even answer, answer your phone calls. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1862.744s">And</a> so the current, like, since then, like a lot of younger progressives from much, I would say, like much more diverse backgrounds. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1875.314s">So</a> like, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1876.074s">You</a> know, renters some of the renters homeowners some of them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1881.402s">Some</a> of them are lifelong residents others were not. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1885.302s">just</a> really made it a point to try to reach out to as many of these voters as possible who felt like they had not been listened to and who felt like they really wanted to be a part of that local political scene. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nlbnh9NlbBVvZM2e2GDT6?t=1898.967s">And</a> I think that that, more than anything, that inclusion of just as many people as possible is what really led to the success of progressives at the local level, which we've seen in the past couple of elections.

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a9xOVRCPDrM&t=2567.393s">Nope,</a> nope. <a href="https://youtu.be/a9xOVRCPDrM&t=2569.135s">I</a> think <a href="https://youtu.be/a9xOVRCPDrM&t=2570.665s">I</a> do think that to sort of like sell this to the public, it would help to say something, to say something like, oh, well, we, you know, wouldn't have had to close down the studio if that building had been better maintained, or we wouldn't have to spend this much money on our new HVAC systems if we just put this much money into it in previous years. <a href="https://youtu.be/a9xOVRCPDrM&t=2596.347s">just</a> what I was kind of fishing for was individual stories where we could have done better as a justification for as a stronger justification for this plan when illustrating to the public in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/a9xOVRCPDrM&t=2609.739s">But</a> now that was unsatisfied.<h2><a href="../2025-05-28_IdMgzj9PVYQ/2025-05-28_IdMgzj9PVYQ.html">CPlanning and Permitting Committee Meeting 05-28-25</a></h2>

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IdMgzj9PVYQ&t=2953.661s">Okay,</a> so probably my biggest, okay, so, and what you were saying earlier about the fact that the, I'm looking again at Harvard and Maine, it's just a very small sliver of it seems to be the commercial one, so four stories by right, but were you saying earlier that they're really not able to take advantage of it because it's such a small area?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IdMgzj9PVYQ&t=3062.494s">So</a> you think it's more likely a developer will try to take advantage of the proposed zoning in that area since it is expanded than what they have currently?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IdMgzj9PVYQ&t=3100.481s">And</a> for the little lot in front of Tufts Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/IdMgzj9PVYQ&t=3105.745s">So</a> that's kind of one of my pet peeves of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/IdMgzj9PVYQ&t=3109.628s">I</a> think that's pretty much one of the biggest pieces of lost potential that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/IdMgzj9PVYQ&t=3115.973s">It's</a> such a nice area, but it just seems to be very underutilized. <a href="https://youtu.be/IdMgzj9PVYQ&t=3122.873s">Assuming</a> the parking rules stay static, and given that there is a small parking lot right in front of that little lot there, how high would they be able to build under the proposed zoning, given the parking requirements that are there now and the amount of parking they currently have in front of the building? <a href="https://youtu.be/IdMgzj9PVYQ&t=3145.702s">That</a> was kind of a math problem, but... You have very few.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IdMgzj9PVYQ&t=3189.79s">What</a> I'm getting is, I just really want that parcel to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/IdMgzj9PVYQ&t=3192.812s">I</a> just really want somebody to actually make something cool there and be super incentivized to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IdMgzj9PVYQ&t=3199.637s">But</a> I guess a lot of that will come up when we review the parking next month. <a href="https://youtu.be/IdMgzj9PVYQ&t=3207.243s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IdMgzj9PVYQ&t=3207.683s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IdMgzj9PVYQ&t=3209.784s">It's</a> just an interesting little area because it's just because of the mix of commercial uses and residential uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/IdMgzj9PVYQ&t=3220.175s">Yeah,</a> no, that's all the questions I have on it for now. <a href="https://youtu.be/IdMgzj9PVYQ&t=3223.797s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IdMgzj9PVYQ&t=5009.64s">I</a> just like to say to express, I think it's a really cool idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/IdMgzj9PVYQ&t=5013.703s">I'd</a> like to move forward on it, however feasibly we can do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/IdMgzj9PVYQ&t=5022.57s">I</a> mean, the idea of having a locally owned bakery in the middle of Lawrence Estates, which is kind of, <a href="https://youtu.be/IdMgzj9PVYQ&t=5035.915s">far</a> from, which is relatively far from other commercial areas, I think would be pretty cool. <a href="https://youtu.be/IdMgzj9PVYQ&t=5043.504s">Would</a> the ACU proposal sort of be its own package that in itself would go through the CDB and council as like its own thing, or would it be sort of attached to something else?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IdMgzj9PVYQ&t=5074.998s">Yeah,</a> I personally would like to see it attached to something else just to simplify things. <a href="https://youtu.be/IdMgzj9PVYQ&t=5082.72s">I</a> feel like there's already a lot of packages that the CDB is sort of dealing with right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/IdMgzj9PVYQ&t=5088.502s">So</a> that's just my take, though.<h2><a href="../2025-05-27_B1AX1IdGJno/2025-05-27_B1AX1IdGJno.html">City Council 05-27-25</a></h2>

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IP1sqjGemck&t=4778.491s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IP1sqjGemck&t=4778.951s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IP1sqjGemck&t=4779.191s">That's</a> all I wanted to know.<h2><a href="../2025-05-25_rqFXCDjAlME/2025-05-25_rqFXCDjAlME.html">2025 Campaign Kickoff!</a></h2>
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rqFXCDjAlME&t=0.841s">Hey,</a> Councilor Matt Leming here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rqFXCDjAlME&t=2.422s">I'm</a> a scientist, I'm an affordable housing activist, I'm a military brat, and I'm proud to represent you on City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/rqFXCDjAlME&t=8.345s">And</a> I'm excited to announce that I'm going to be running for a second term. <a href="https://youtu.be/rqFXCDjAlME&t=12.228s">Two</a> years ago, I promised transparency, I promised to address Medford's thinning budget, I promised to invest in more affordable housing, and I've kept those promises. <a href="https://youtu.be/rqFXCDjAlME&t=21.401s">This</a> past City Council has been the most productive that Medford has seen in literally decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/rqFXCDjAlME&t=27.042s">We're</a> investing in our public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/rqFXCDjAlME&t=28.823s">We</a> saved 40 teaching jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/rqFXCDjAlME&t=30.583s">We</a> hired a dedicated crew to repair our roads and sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/rqFXCDjAlME&t=34.304s">We're</a> reaching out to more residents with a newsletter, listening sessions, live streaming. <a href="https://youtu.be/rqFXCDjAlME&t=39.745s">City</a> Council is now completely rezoning the city to build more affordable housing, mandate greener building practices, and bring in more commercial revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/rqFXCDjAlME&t=49.524s">I</a> worked with the city and local nonprofits to create programs dedicated to housing veteran renters, and I'm working with parents of youth with disabilities to create programming to support their kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/rqFXCDjAlME&t=61.169s">And</a> together, we're going way further than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rqFXCDjAlME&t=63.351s">Right</a> now, the federal government is abducting our neighbors and trying to sow fear in the community, so local government is pushing back. <a href="https://youtu.be/rqFXCDjAlME&t=70.214s">I</a> worked to make Medford into a sanctuary city, and I spearheaded a campaign to teach migrant communities their rights to keep them safer. <a href="https://youtu.be/rqFXCDjAlME&t=78.033s">Together,</a> we need to keep fighting, we need to keep winning, we need to keep this upward trend going, we need to keep Medford inclusive. <a href="https://youtu.be/rqFXCDjAlME&t=85.262s">I'm</a> so proud of the progress that we've made, and I'm so grateful that more and more people want to call Medford home. <a href="https://youtu.be/rqFXCDjAlME&t=91.349s">Come</a> to my campaign kickoff on June 14th. <a href="https://youtu.be/rqFXCDjAlME&t=93.993s">I'd</a> love to have you there.<h2><a href="../2025-05-11_fJPuZ1xCyoY/2025-05-11_fJPuZ1xCyoY.html">Red Cards</a></h2>
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=1.55s">Hello,</a> City Councilor Matt LeMing here. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=4.352s">So</a> what I am going to talk about today is the Red Card campaign. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=14.221s">Bit</a> of backstory. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=16.943s">Obviously,</a> with some of the recent events in Medford, namely the abduction of Hermesa Ozturk and <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=26.824s">Other</a> reports that I've been hearing from the community about ICE going around neighborhoods, detaining migrants in other municipalities in greater Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=41.778s">We've</a> been hearing a lot of feedback from constituents where they want us to do something as local elected representatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=56.603s">I've</a> had people call me out personally for, you know, asking me, you know, do something to make us feel safe, just put out some sort of reply, take some kind of action on this topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=74.457s">Back</a> in January, Medford City Council decided to pass a Welcoming City Ordinance, which is sanctuary city legislation, and this was a week before the current administration came into office. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=89.662s">So</a> in some ways, as local elected officials, we kind of <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=95.84s">took</a> action before the wave really started. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=101.542s">But</a> that wasn't quite as publicized as it could have been. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=106.184s">I</a> mean, you know, I wrote about it on my website. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=109.526s">We</a> passed it through. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=111.387s">It</a> had been on the dockets in city council for over a year before we did it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=116.729s">But</a> even so, people weren't really paying attention until all of this stuff started to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=127.18s">So</a> we so we and I say this because we actually have had people come to city council saying make Medford do a sanctuary city and I just say we already did that several months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=140.268s">So</a> I am also involved in the executive committee of the of the <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=150.563s">Medford</a> Democrat, so I'm secretary. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=152.684s">There</a> are two co-chairs, there are ward chairs for all of Medford's eight wards, and there's me, which is a secretary. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=160.428s">I'm</a> mainly in charge of communications and note-taking paperwork. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=164.95s">There's</a> also a treasurer and a diversity officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=169.852s">And</a> there were some discussions within the committee about, okay, what can we do to show that we're putting up some kind of response to all of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=180.977s">So</a> one member came up with the idea of buying these red cards. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=189.56s">They</a> look like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=191.021s">They</a> are simple ID-sized cards where on one side they just list your basic Fourth and Fifth Amendment constitutional rights, saying that you don't have to talk to police officers, you don't have to open a door if nobody gives you a <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=210.648s">if</a> nobody has a warrant with your name on it and on the other side in different languages there's just instructions for how to use it focused on of course people who are migrants who may be wondering what they can do with these so there's instructions saying that you know you don't have to open a door if nobody has a warrant or they're not looking for you specifically you don't have to answer questions you can just hand this card <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=239.125s">to</a> an officer who's trying to question you and that shows what your response will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=247.172s">And</a> so, to me, this is just a very basic question of telling people what their rights are and helping people who may be scared or feel unsafe just handle these situations in as healthy a way as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=261.003s">To</a> me, it seemed like a very common sense move. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=263.65s">So</a> we had a special meeting on April 7th within the Democratic City Committee in which there were something like about a dozen a little more than a dozen people that were that were in attendance and we discussed it and voted to authorize the purchase of up to 8,000 of these cards which would <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=285.351s">be</a> approximately $826. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=289.233s">By</a> the end of it, we purchased 4,000 cards in Arabic, Portuguese, Spanish, and Haitian Creole, because Medford has community liaisons for each of those communities, so we figured it was a pretty representative set of foreign languages for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=307.924s">And</a> then, <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=312.663s">we</a> tried to find ways to distribute them. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=318.472s">A</a> caveat of all of this is that these were purchased by campaign funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=322.916s">If</a> you have campaign funds, then you either spend it on costs that are associated with the campaign, like mailers, paying staff, et cetera, or if, for instance, you're a candidate who lost, you don't wanna run for office again, but you still have money in your campaign account, you just can't put it in your personal account, you have to give it to charity. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=346.356s">So</a> the co-chair had a conversation with OCPF and they told him that these are campaign funds but we can effectively give them to charity and if we wanted to do that then we could purchase red cards but we would have to give them to non-profit organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=363.27s">So</a> that's the route that we ended up going down. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=367.654s">I</a> ended up creating just a simple Google form and tried to solicit ideas from folks about which nonprofits we can give them to. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=375.08s">So</a> just churches, community organizations, things of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=383.248s">you</a> know, just try to advertise it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=386.189s">So</a> I put a Reddit post about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=388.229s">I</a> put it onto a couple of Facebook groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=391.63s">I'm</a> gonna be putting it out onto my personal mailing list. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=396.332s">And</a> that's where things got a little bit surprising for me because I put out an advertisement for those red cards on Twitter. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=409.203s">I</a> think it was like April 28th, I think, so two days after I physically got some myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=416.511s">And</a> then I think it was later that night that somebody from WBZ Radio reached out to me and wanted to interview me about the red card issue, about just, you know, what the Democratic City Committee was doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=433.878s">And,</a> you know, I'm a politician entering campaign season, I'm not going to be refusing free media, so I end up interviewing with him. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=446.557s">That</a> interview happened at 9am, the story was posted before 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=450.722s">And</a> a few hours later, I got a call from Boston 25, and they were like, hey, we want to interview you about this too. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=460.765s">So</a> I interviewed them before a city council meeting, and they, you know, it took like 15 minutes, went inside, it aired that night. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=471.548s">And</a> then the next day, Boston.com <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=476.617s">NBC</a> Telemundo, the Spanish language news and <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=484.867s">Fox</a> News Digital all reached out to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=488.449s">I</a> interviewed with NBC Telemundo that next morning, interviewed over the phone with Boston.com, and answered some questions over email with Fox News. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=501.958s">And</a> that was posted, and then it was reposted by a couple of other sites, and so on. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=508.023s">I</a> was personally surprised that this got so much attention because one, it was still pretty early stages. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=512.97s">Two,</a> it just seemed like a pretty, you know, common sense thing to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=517.514s">And</a> three, it just seemed like a pretty low effort thing that we had done, whereas I feel like I've put a lot more effort into, for instance, the override campaigns, and we really struggled to get media attention around that throughout the campaign. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=534.662s">And</a> it just seemed like that whole media cycle just sort of took off. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=539.624s">And</a> that's really the first time that something like that has ever happened for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=546.227s">But</a> it did end up getting some more signups on the Google Sheets, so that was good. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=555.671s">So</a> concurrently, City Council also <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=562.85s">This</a> was, so the Democratic City Committee meeting where we approved those happened on April 7th. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=569.232s">On</a> April 8th, the City Council also approved a Know Your Rights campaign in which we endorsed the release of Know Your Rights information, similar information to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=585.595s">And</a> those things, that initiative <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=589.328s">is</a> totally unrelated to what was happening with the Democratic City Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=594.706s">Usually</a> with those kinds of resolutions that require action, often what it is, is it's the city council requesting the city, i.e. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=602.489s">the</a> mayor's office to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=604.57s">So</a> we're endorsing an action and just requires the mayor to actually do something about it themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=611.832s">And</a> oftentimes we could pass a resolution, it could be ignored, or it could pass a resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=616.133s">We</a> just really have to push behind the scenes to make something happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=621.994s">I</a> think throughout this whole process, a lot of city council has been taking a different approach to this situation than the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=630.325s">City</a> Council, we're really taking more of an activist stance on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=633.828s">We</a> really want to. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=635.249s">We</a> know a lot of folks feel unsafe. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=637.471s">We</a> want to show people where we stand with what's happening at the national level right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=645.036s">The</a> mayor is concerned about the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=649.139s">She's</a> afraid of losing federal funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=651.501s">And</a> so I think there's just a little bit of differences in points of view in terms of where folks land on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=658.286s">And</a> I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=659.247s">You</a> know, there are points to both sides, but I've made my decision in terms of where I want to go with that, particularly because I think that, you know, during the first Trump administration, they did attempt to, for instance, revoke federal funding from sanctuary cities and failed. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=678.471s">So</a> I just don't think that those efforts <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=683.96s">really</a> like they didn't work in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=686.502s">So</a> I think they're less likely to work in the in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=689.964s">But</a> even if they do work this time, because obviously these two administrations are very different, then, you know, I do I do think that at some point you do have to put human rights above above municipal funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=707.215s">So</a> that's just that's just my two cents on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=710.136s">That's</a> that's my point of view. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=715.824s">Yeah,</a> mainly, I'm also sharing this because people are quite afraid right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=726.169s">We</a> had a trans woman talk about how she felt unsafe at a recent city council meeting very late at night, and the city council spent a little bit of time assuring her that things were, that we were on her side, we were trying our best to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=744.264s">I</a> was on the phone with a Haitian woman the other day just trying to get her to sign her church up on the Google form that I put out just so I could send over some of these red cards to her. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=758.861s">And</a> she was afraid of even putting anything on the internet, having any paper trail. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=764.107s">thought</a> that the government could get access to Google, which I didn't really think was quite as much of a concern as she thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=771.871s">But</a> the point was that the fear was still there. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=775.353s">You</a> know, when I other members of the Democratic City Committee, when the Fox News thing came out, they wanted their emails temporarily removed from the website because they're afraid of people reaching out to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=786.96s">And,</a> you know, I got some I got some messages when I was <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=791.002s">When</a> I was put on the news from some people who were really unpleasant like it just just trolls like just sent like nasty messages onto my Facebook and Instagram and I'm not really <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=807.583s">afraid</a> of that kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=808.723s">I</a> just kind of see them as paper tigers. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=810.464s">But</a> I'm relating that because I think a lot of people, when they do start to get out there, that sort of draws this response from these crazy right-wingers who will try to intimidate folks who speak out. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=824.948s">And</a> I'm just saying that as a way to relate, it happens to everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=832.19s">These</a> people are cowards. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=833.19s">They're</a> paper tigers. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=834.131s">Just</a> don't <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=835.751s">like</a> you should feel free to speak up if you think that you're in a position to speak up or you won't be targeted by people who might actually put you in danger. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=848.895s">But,</a> you know, don't be afraid to speak up just because you might get some unpleasant messages from people who are just mentally unwell and happen to have a computer. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=862.659s">So,</a> so yeah, that's <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=865.958s">That's,</a> that's just that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=866.918s">So</a> yeah, I'm just, I'm just putting out this, I'm just putting out this video blog just to, you know, talk about what happened from my perspective, just to, you know, relay an interesting story, um, about some media cycles and an initiative that I see as a very common sense, which, which I think everybody can get around, you know, um, I, <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=894.628s">When</a> it comes to the red card situation, I honestly don't understand why it's controversial because nobody should be above the Constitution. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=908.651s">All</a> this does is list two amendments from the Bill of Rights and explains to people how they work. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=917.203s">A</a> question that Fox News asked me was it said, like this was one of the questions they emailed me, they said, some people think that these rights don't apply to non-citizens, which is not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=930.633s">The</a> Fourth and Fifth Amendment say people and persons, they don't say citizens, and this was reaffirmed in a 1993 Supreme Court case where Justice Scalia wrote that it's been well known that the Fifth Amendment applies in deportation cases for illegal aliens. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=951.597s">So</a> the idea that somehow <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=956.493s">the</a> Constitution, constitutional rights don't apply to non-citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=960.394s">It's</a> just, it's just a farce. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=962.094s">Like</a> I don't, I don't understand where that, where that sort of thinking is coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=965.715s">So,</a> so yeah, like in, in summary, red cards definitely should be distributed to migrant communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=977.738s">I</a> personally find that it's, <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=980.619s">more</a> important to try to find ways to reach out to communities who might be more vulnerable and kind of are generally are far away from city politics. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=994.984s">I</a> think that that's more important personally than <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=998.545s">Going</a> to Then going to protests not not that you shouldn't go to protests but just like for my personal priorities like I just think the way that I can make the most impact is trying to find ways to reach those groups of people who will like actually be the most affected by this whereas You know, I don't think that migrants who are <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=1021.319s">scared</a> or unsure about what's going to happen or don't speak English are going to be going to a lot of these protests in like Boston Common. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=1031.407s">They're</a> going to be going to community spaces that normally people in progressive and political circles don't interact with. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=1038.292s">So</a> I'm really trying to find ways to break into that and, you know, tell people how they can be kept safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=1046.26s">So</a> that's really my priority as a local politician when dealing with this stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=1052.564s">Anyway.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=1057.965s">Yeah,</a> not much more to say about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=1062.006s">If</a> you've watched this far, thank you very much for tuning in. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=1068.047s">And</a> if you want to request any red cards, then feel free to fill out the form, which is linked in the blog and other places. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=1078.808s">If</a> you don't list a legitimate 501c3, I'm not gonna be sending them to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=1088.791s">So</a> there's a person who's a graduate of Harvard, for instance, who said that he represented Harvard as a 501c3. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=1094.214s">I'm</a> not sending him red cards, but if it's like a church where you've talked to the pastor or a community organization where you know somebody there, just feel free to request it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=1103.84s">And</a> if we have any left, I'll send them over. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=1110.184s">So</a> yeah, thank you very much for tuning in and feel free to come to city council meetings in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/fJPuZ1xCyoY&t=1118.34s">All</a> right, thank you very much and yeah, have a wonderful day, bye.<h2><a href="../2025-05-07_lGHiIPcdGwg/2025-05-07_lGHiIPcdGwg.html">City Council

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1563.606s">But</a> would it be the HRC itself who decides what specifically? <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1567.39s">They</a> would take a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1568.23s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1568.41s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1568.891s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1569.131s">I</a> gotcha. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1569.591s">That</a> clarifies it. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1570.853s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1571.653s">I'm</a> going to recognize Munir Jermanas on Zoom asking you to unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/lGHiIPcdGwg&t=1577.538s">Please</a> state your name and address for the record, please.

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2992.949s">You</a> actually answered my other question right there in your response, which is how how is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2997.71s">How</a> is it reported? <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=2999.551s">So</a> it is the patrol division, as you said, but do <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3005.42s">But</a> is it has like everybody in the patrol division kind of like made this like made this mistake sort of once or twice throughout the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3013.667s">And</a> that's just kind of like a random things that happens to everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3016.469s">Or</a> do you see like a couple of like a couple that you see self-reported?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3045.165s">Okay,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3046.886s">That</a> answers the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3049.448s">That</a> was the only thing that I was <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3052.384s">That</a> was the only thing that I was curious about in the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3059.392s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3074.911s">see</a> that it's like it was just just for context, this is, I believe it was, yeah, it was saying that it was a 2024, 224 of these special notifications forms were filed, of which 131 were failed to activate, and this seems to be out of <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3095.83s">Yeah,</a> it's a 31,326 with 224 special notifications forms and it says here that's point 72%. <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3098.893s">So,</a> yeah, just for just for anybody from the public watching what I was having questions about was <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3112.675s">an</a> extremely low percentage of the overall cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3117.738s">I</a> was just curious about the overall trends within the department if these were completely random. <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3125.602s">But</a> yes, the failure to activate is not something that happens often by any stretch of the imagination. <a href="https://youtu.be/HW_5AfM_YUs&t=3132.965s">So</a> thank you for clarifying that.<h2><a href="../2025-05-06_zzXcJKCGyZo/2025-05-06_zzXcJKCGyZo.html">City Council Committee of the Whole 05-06-25</a></h2>
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=2078.112s">Yes,</a> I would also like to echo all the praise that my colleague just gave. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=2084.696s">This</a> is a department that has far too many tasks and demand, and I feel like it just doesn't have the <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=2099.047s">capacity</a> to fulfill to fulfill all of that, which is which relates to my question. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=2105.492s">So,</a> you know, as a city councilors, we often get concerns about things like rats in the city, which is not uncommon with municipalities in greater Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=2120.503s">We</a> get concerns about like there's one resident who is messaging me about <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=2128.227s">raccoons</a> that are in a neighboring house that she can't seem to do anything about. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=2133.413s">I'm</a> sure that you're aware of the case that I'm talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=2138.359s">And,</a> of course, we also hear a number of concerns about dog poop not being picked up, things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=2145.848s">And</a> I see <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=2148.13s">that</a> there is one animal control officer who I've heard is a one man department and himself so very much appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=2155.932s">Uh,</a> my question first is how, given all of the, uh, given all the need around the city for the services that are offered by the department by the by the Board of Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=2170.336s">How</a> many employees do you think you would need in a perfect world to fulfill all of that? <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=2176.118s">So</a> I don't think that the <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=2178.29s">11</a> personnel that we're seeing is necessarily enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=2180.972s">But</a> just hypothetically, if the city did have more resources to handle, what would what would be your need?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=2246.535s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=2248.289s">So</a> I was hearing about five different you probably need about five more people to plus additional funding for the programming in order to meet at least some of that need was was what I was.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=2284.698s">And</a> for for all of the positions that that I'm seeing here. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=2291.402s">Would</a> you say that the amount of the salaries listed is commensurate with what we see in other municipalities is a little bit more, a little bit less, what would, how would you put that?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=2332.316s">And</a> a very specific question this just relates to a little bit of research I was doing in response to what one constituent was asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=2340.511s">The</a> sanitarians. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=2343.594s">So</a> I had a constituent who was saying that the sanitarians in Medford didn't have a state license, which I looked up sanitarians in other municipalities, and I found out that that was pretty common. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=2356.023s">So</a> most of them didn't have a license under the state for the, I think it was like the Board of Health Sanitarian License. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=2364.709s">Can</a> you just for my own benefit tell me about what <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=2368.832s">that</a> processes or what the benefit of that of having that is.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=2451.829s">No,</a> I was just curious about that for my own knowledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=2454.47s">And</a> finally, <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=2456.692s">So</a> we've been receiving some demand from constituents who really want backyard chickens. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=2464.698s">They</a> want to have chickens in their backyard. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=2467.66s">It</a> is something that I have been hearing from niche groups for a little bit now. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=2473.985s">But</a> the Board of Health does not want to deal with backyard chickens. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=2477.908s">And</a> I understand that there are good reasons for not wanting to deal with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=2481.65s">So</a> could you just <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=2484.125s">While</a> I'm asking you questions, could you just talk a little bit about why, like what extra staffing hypothetically would be needed to deal with that in the future? <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=2494.707s">Should</a> we move in that direction? <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=2496.027s">Just</a> some of your concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=2497.808s">Sure.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=2559.826s">Okay,</a> well, I used to own chickens well my mom did so I'm a little bit biased in that direction but this is a conversation for another day.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=3199.712s">I</a> mean, I personally think it's a very interesting piece of information, but it would be the police department that could answer that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=3206.996s">So</a> I was just thinking about <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=3208.785s">I'm</a> wondering if this body would be amenable to a motion to just request that information from Chief Buckley.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=4082.775s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=4084.016s">Could</a> you just if the charter does pass and we have to make seven seats into 11 I'm just looking for a guesstimate here. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=4091.622s">What</a> like how much do you think that that would cost total?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=4192.71s">So</a> what's the minimum that you think it could cost? <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=4197.051s">And</a> what's the most you think it could cost?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=4220.382s">So</a> under $100,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=4222.183s">So</a> you don't think it would be in the million dollar
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=4232.385s">So</a> why did the windows cost around?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=5145.055s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=5145.495s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=5148.325s">How</a> much would it cost, and do you think it would be feasible to get one of those phishing simulation programs? <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=5161.069s">So</a> in my last job, we would periodically get phishing emails that were actually sent out by IT.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=5219.459s">I</a> get a lot of I get a lot of emails from Zach asking me if I have time for a for a quick task.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=5252.718s">Well,</a> well, the ones in my previous employer, the way it worked was if people actually did click on them or they, they didn't report them, then it would sort of mark those users being like less, um, able to work out that it was a phishing email of what you're supposed to do is just report it.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=5274.11s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=5275.35s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=5670.417s">No,</a> well, are we going to, we're going to, when the new elections person is brought, the new elections manager is brought on, they're going to come before city council and we can talk to them, right?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=5703.873s">Yeah,</a> I'll save my questions for then. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=5705.515s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=5705.935s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=7476.236s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=7477.677s">First,</a> just one question and then a bit more comment, but besides the money that we received from the federal government, how much just on average free cash have we generated as a result of unspent money from the yearly operating budget year to year?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=7519.086s">Well,</a> what I mean by the question, and it's just a percentage. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=7523.328s">So</a> the state recommends that it's between 3% to 5%. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=7526.909s">Um,</a> every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=7527.87s">So</a> I was just I just wanted to know if I didn't want to get into like a long discussion about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=7533.192s">But</a> if you had it off the top of your head, like, I just want to know if there's sort of like an average number that the city has been putting into free cash as a result of unspent money from the operating budget every year.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=7558.634s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=7559.074s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=7559.755s">That's</a> fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=7560.515s">I</a> was just curious if you did, but you know, not everybody would necessarily have that off the top of your head, but to comment on a few points. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=7569.401s">So</a> yes, taking two truths at one time is, <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=7575.054s">is</a> something that we ask people to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=7577.816s">I</a> think saying that there's a million dollar deficit in a year when we successfully passed an override is understandable because we have been experiencing a very difficult economy. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=7595.803s">And</a> the fact is that if the override had not passed, we would be in a far worse situation than otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=7606.043s">people</a> continue to conflate the free cash with operating budgets. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=7611.684s">The</a> fact of the matter is that it is bad practice to use free cash to pay for salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=7617.786s">That's</a> not something the state recommends doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=7620.406s">That</a> affects our ability to get, that affects our bond ratings. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=7624.907s">It</a> affects our ability to get loans in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=7626.807s">It's</a> just not good practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=7628.528s">And</a> I think people, <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=7630.112s">We'll</a> continue to bring that up in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=7635.674s">$26</a> million in free cash for 28 million is not a, it is a fairly normal amount of money to have in the reserves for a city with an operating budget of $218 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=7650.741s">So</a> that's not unusual. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=7652.622s">In</a> the history of Medford, where we used to operate with no free cash at all, it is a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=7660.462s">but</a> we should never have been in a position where we're operating with almost no free cash at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=7665.146s">So</a> I think that a lot of residents are seeing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=7667.567s">They're</a> like, why don't we spend that money when they're, when what they're thinking about is a history of poor financial practice that they took for granted. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=7675.353s">So</a> I think what's going to happen with that is it's going to keep, it's going to keep coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=7678.836s">I</a> think there's a combination of people who genuinely misunderstand, um, the differences between free cash and operating budgets and people who will keep bringing it, bringing it up in, <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=7690.323s">when</a> they actually do understand that, but they just kind of want to use it for political purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=7694.365s">So</a> that's just a reality that we're looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=7698.408s">What</a> I'll say my personal frustrations are with it, though, is that I do see that we're expending a very significant amount of free cash on things that we do need. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=7708.479s">the</a> HVAC systems we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=7709.88s">I</a> am absolutely fine putting up $5 million for air conditioning for our school systems in addition to the $25 million loan. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=7718.824s">But</a> there's also other studies that I really want to see happen that would cost a much smaller amount of money, like the NEXUS study to update our linkage fees or a new study to update the entirety of the capital improvements program, which would cost <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=7738.194s">Under</a> $200,000, I would like to see a transportation demand management study, which would really help development in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=7745.278s">And</a> those as I see them are very significant investments. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=7751.341s">But</a> we're not spending it on those, even though the returns on those studies would be humongous. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=7758.144s">And</a> I did put those in as asks to the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=7764.331s">And</a> I do understand that the mayor attempted to pay for that with the sale of McCormick Avenue, but this this council voted it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=7773.182s">We</a> disagreed on selling off public land for that but even so with, you know, for me personally saying the $28 million that we have and then we're not willing to spend it on. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=7783.775s">what</a> is a relatively small amount for studies that would pay hugely in the future, um, is something that I'm I'm a little bit frustrated with. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=7796.46s">So</a> that's all I have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=7798.08s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=8239.058s">I</a> don't think the argument that we have too much free cash is something I would disagree with. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=8247.444s">The</a> argument that I disagree with, which was what was continuously brought up during the override, was that we should take staff salaries out of free cash and not have an override. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=8259.0s">I</a> mean, that was, I mean, that's a change in narrative. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=8263.223s">Like,</a> I think that everybody here would like to see the amount of free cash that we have spent on capital projects as it should be spent on, but the arguments that were being made <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=8278.48s">During</a> this override were again that if we did not have one, and we just put all our free cash towards teacher salaries and we would be completely tapped out in a few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=8290.59s">So</a> that is the first time that I've heard my colleague say that, whereas before he was saying that we should be just paying for our staff shortfalls from the override. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=8307.463s">Now</a> it's like, okay, no, we have too much free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=8310.766s">We</a> should have less because we need to spend it on things. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=8314.349s">Yeah,</a> I agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=8317.594s">It's</a> a different argument entirely from what was being brought up before. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=8323.0s">I</a> do think that we need to spend the free cash that we have on capital projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=8335.113s">We</a> can still have a <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=8337.659s">$1</a> million deficit, because again, this is the difference between money that is used for capital expenses and money that is used for ongoing operating expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=8348.168s">So</a> yeah, I mean, I was just wanting to make that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=8353.452s">I</a> mean, and in terms of a future override, like the intent of prop two and a half was to have periodic overrides. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=8365.112s">Medford</a> waited 40 years before we even had one override, which was far too long for a city of our size. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=8373.563s">Now,</a> could the next override happen in another 40 years? <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=8377.472s">maybe.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=8378.073s">But</a> the point is that in a city's entire existence, I mean with the way that this is designed, you can't just have a single override and then expect that to be okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=8389.421s">If</a> you look at the state databanks with other municipalities that have had <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=8395.605s">It</a> shows like the history of override of these other municipalities in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=8399.108s">Yes,</a> they have continued, like different municipalities have continuously had overrides. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=8404.833s">Normally,</a> like sometimes every 10 years, sometimes every five years, sometimes they'll do one in like the year 2000 and then they'll do one in 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=8411.658s">It</a> just varies depending on the state of the economy and the needs of the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=8414.761s">So</a> yeah, like trying to act like it's a boogeyman thing to say, oh, we might need another override in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=8421.566s">That's</a> just like, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=8424.364s">yeah,</a> we might, I hope it's not in the next 10 to 15 years, but you know, it could happen just depend it, it will likely need to happen at some time in the more distant future. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=8435.306s">So,</a> so yeah, those are, that's, that's the points that, that I wanted to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=8440.668s">I</a> mean, I don't disagree with my colleague that we need less free, that we should have less free cash than we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=8445.589s">That's</a> a frustration of mine, but that's not what, that's not the argument that was being made previously.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=8619.623s">I</a> would get in a back and forth about this, <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=8622.469s">I,</a> I don't really think it's worth it at this point we, we had plenty of these conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/zzXcJKCGyZo&t=8629.254s">During</a> the override so I don't, I really don't feel like rehashing this at this point I mean everybody remembers what was said so yeah that's that.<h2><a href="../2025-06-04_nSVrs1f-rd8/2025-06-04_nSVrs1f-rd8.html">City Council Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee 05-04-25</a></h2>

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=767.878s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=768.839s">For</a> present, one absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=770.24s">Meeting</a> is called to order. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=772.281s">The</a> first thing we're going to do is try to knock out this newsletter, which was so graciously drafted by Councilor Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=784.09s">Thank</a> you very much for <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=786.378s">pulling</a> up all of those links. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=788.698s">I'm</a> just going to go.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=792.059s">Well,</a> yeah, especially during budget season.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=841.567s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=842.067s">So</a> basically the only edits that I made to this draft, and this is the formatted version where I added the Memorial Day resolution and yeah, tracking those suspended resolutions is always a little.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=861.233s">Oh,</a> yeah, no, that's I've done that multiple times before the resolutions under suspension are hard to keep track of. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=868.355s">I</a> added what we're doing today. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=870.576s">So,</a> assuming that we do get done with these two things might as well just throw that on retroactively. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=878.822s">Um,</a> I added yesterday's meeting, uh, saying we hosted facilities manager Paul right here to offer an update to the city council regarding the estimated costs of repairing and maintaining all city on facilities in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=892.327s">Um,</a> and let's see, what else did I just a quick point of information chair looming.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=905.153s">Shoot.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=906.093s">Well,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=907.605s">There</a> aren't that many people in this meeting to catch my.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=911.487s">So,</a> but I'm sure that my pronunciation will be correct over text in this newsletter. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=921.012s">And</a> I also added just an extra link to the planning and permitting committee because this other corridors business was discussed on both May 14th and May 28th. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=930.536s">Councilor</a> Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=936.562s">Oh,</a> um, you can go through your stuff first. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=939.144s">Oh,</a> um, well, I think I'm just trying, I'm just trying to look and remember, but I think I want to say that that was about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=949.012s">Just</a> those couple of those extra meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=952.255s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=952.675s">Just</a> a few details that were missed, but overall, yeah, this was a pretty, you know, it was, it was good job. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=959.421s">So</a> yeah, feel free to bring up what you'd, <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=962.74s">uh,</a> whatever was on your mind.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=1020.258s">On</a> May 13th, after much review and committee, we approve for first reading the governing ordinance from Edwards Human Rights Commission to empower it to run more effectively and respond to new challenges.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=1052.378s">That's</a> the right to stay open on May 10th of every year.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=1196.741s">Councilor</a> is saying, oh, you put your hand down.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=1228.743s">My</a> impression of this was that if we're like referring to the veteran's office, it's I mean, yeah, yeah, we, we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=1237.188s">That's</a> we'd like, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=1240.63s">Um,</a> sure.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=1394.534s">Okay,</a> we approved your request to amend the commons furthest that permitted <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=1405.083s">The</a> establishment to stay up until 1 am permits present probably. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=1411.304s">quit</a> correcting my grammar law school boy. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=1415.308s">No,</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=1417.109s">Yeah,</a> and while that discussion was happening, I also noticed that there was one item under general business that probably should have been under public health and community safety, the CCOPS.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=1436.007s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=1443.136s">I</a> wasn't sure where to put it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=1447.682s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=1447.983s">That's</a> always kind of troublesome, because like it.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=1457.109s">That</a> wasn't public health.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=1487.048s">I</a> just feel like general business is too big and I like to write just for visuals.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=1499.05s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=1500.391s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=1500.951s">It's</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=1502.151s">So</a> it's still obviously after like extract YouTube links, but other than that, is anybody, um, okay with what's with what's written here so far?

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=1839.731s">Can</a> you repeat how many responses total we got? <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=1844.533s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=2101.407s">Councilor</a> Lazzaro, feel free to ask your question.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=2140.907s">No,</a> no, and that's an excellent point. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=2144.129s">It</a> is what the majority of Medford we know for sure cares about. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=2150.592s">Councilor</a> is saying it said 46 responses for both of them, like for each of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=2155.154s">And</a> do you have any, I don't know if you noticed off the top of your head, but like, do you have an idea of like how many mentioned either one? <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=2162.037s">Like,</a> was it like 60 or 80? <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=2164.772s">that</a> mention either schools or roads or both?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=3079.999s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=3080.419s">That</a> was a very thorough summary. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=3082.621s">Much</a> appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=3083.601s">And</a> I'm also glad that it got written down in a document that can be distributed after the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=3091.805s">Do</a> we have any questions from councillors? <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=3101.51s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=3101.971s">Councilor</a> Lazzaro.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=3236.331s">Do</a> we have any comments from members of the public, if anybody would like to? <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=3243.593s">ask</a> any questions on Zoom, feel free to raise your hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=3248.195s">I</a> see two members of the public there. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=3250.356s">This</a> is one of the more informal committees, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=3257.56s">All</a> right, well, seeing none, just like to, once again, express my appreciation for all the work that you clearly put into this, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=3266.004s">I'm</a> also generally, you know, generally happy that the, <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=3272.572s">Demographics</a> seems to have gotten like a slightly less biased in terms of its demographics from last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=3280.415s">So</a> I think that's good that progress is being made on that end of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=3290.339s">Cool.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=3290.819s">So</a> do we need a motion to keep the paper in committee or a motion to release the survey report? <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=3299.623s">Something</a> like that.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=3361.3s">I</a> do think at some point, we do kind of need to like, say, you know, the survey, this the survey at this point is done, let's distribute more of a final report. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=3370.945s">And</a> then if we want to follow up on that, like you said, we could just do it on our own initiative doesn't necessarily have to be doesn't necessarily have to be a motion here. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=3383.481s">Okay,</a> but I think a motion to distribute the full results of the survey to Councilors publicly distribute the report that you just presented and receive in place the paper on file would probably be an appropriate motion.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=3407.931s">No,</a> no, we still have to review the actual listening sessions themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=3411.373s">So</a> I just want a small description from you and Councilor Lazzaro.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=3422.839s">Yep,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=3424.499s">Okay,</a> on the motion from Councilor Tseng, seconded by Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=3430.482s">Mr.</a> Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=3445.643s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=3446.743s">For</a> affirmative, one absent, the motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=3450.744s">And</a> the last, the very last is a update on our listening session. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=3457.345s">So</a> I understand that councilors <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=3459.598s">Lazzaro</a> and Sang had a listening session recently at the Senior Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=3465.72s">So</a> just an update on how that went, any interesting topics came up, how the vibe was, whichever of you would like to go.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=3646.587s">It's</a> a good idea, especially for, yeah, I think serving people who don't have computer access quite to the same degree that most do is a <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=3659.33s">definitely</a> a good initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=3660.431s">Out</a> of curiosity was like, I noticed when I went to the listening session that some residents were, it was a little bit like a public meeting almost, and some residents were like afraid to speak up. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=3670.535s">So</a> there is a thing, and I think Councilor Callahan went through this as well, where a few residents would like approach us after and sort of ask questions in private. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=3679.62s">Did</a> the same thing sort of happen or was there more of a, were people more like, <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=3685.145s">uh,</a> willing to, yeah, I see the sunlight, uh, were people more sort of like willing to just like say what was on their mind openly.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=3713.142s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=3717.583s">Well,</a> thank you all for the update. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=3720.706s">Is</a> there any other questions from councillors or members of the public? <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=3727.532s">Do</a> we have a motion to keep the paper in committee, or Councilor Callahan? <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=3732.056s">Just,</a> I was, yeah, I was- Oh yeah, motion to keep the paper in committee and adjourn.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=3738.122s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=3739.985s">On</a> the motion by Councilor Callahan, seconded by Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/nSVrs1f-rd8&t=3743.306s">Mr.</a> Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2576.287s">No,</a> if you wanted to finish your <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2578.993s">Your</a> point on that, I was just gonna ask Senior Planner Evans had mentioned at the last meeting on this, a report that had been written some years ago on the justifications for the traffic patterns through Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2595.018s">I</a> was wondering if you ever managed to find that. <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2596.959s">I</a> think it was the Iannis report. <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2600.56s">You</a> had, I think, I believe you emailed me about it.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2627.641s">Yeah,</a> I tried doing some Googling on it, because it is something I'd like to read a bit more about, but I don't know if it's stored somewhere internally. <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2635.646s">I</a> just think it would be some interesting context.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2684.28s">Well,</a> not to get too off topic from the current proposal, but are there any resources that you know of that could shed some light on that mystery? <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2691.422s">Because</a> I've often wondered about the history behind these particular traffic patterns and why <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2699.544s">certain</a> decisions were made. <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2702.986s">So</a> I'd just be interested in any resource that you might know about that could offer a little bit of context for that.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2726.887s">Um,</a> otherwise now I am, um Speaking to the proposal itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2732.028s">I</a> am pleased with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2732.929s">I'm</a> Glad to see that little the plot by City Hall was updated to MX three. <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2741.431s">Um,</a> which Pretty sure that I'm the person here who lives the nearest to that of anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2748.333s">So</a> I think you'll create a very nice, uh, Very nice sound barrier. <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2753.294s">Um,</a> generally <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2756.122s">Generally</a> speaking, I know that Paolo last time talked about sort of the limitations of some of these plots of land. <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2766.706s">So</a> you listed concerns that some of these are maybe too thin or too small to house certain story limitations. <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2775.469s">So</a> I assume that you looked into that and you found that it was fine.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2812.326s">Nope,</a> nope. <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2812.846s">That's</a> all for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=2813.607s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3198.749s">I</a> was going to ask about some of the incentives that you pointed out, the differences and how they were updated, so not directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3210.917s">I'm</a> just curious on MX3 being changed from 6 plus 6 to 8 plus 4. <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3218.901s">In</a> practice, in other communities, how often are these incentives taken up? <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3224.184s">Because</a> I really would like it that people take advantage of the green score. <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3232.075s">TDM,</a> hopefully once we start discussing that in June, with these additional stories for buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3241.059s">But</a> I'd just like to know, what I'm thinking is like a developer could just say, well, I already got eight stories, that's high enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3249.103s">So</a> I don't have to take advantage of the additional four stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3252.645s">Whereas</a> six plus six, they might not be thinking that as much. <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3255.666s">So</a> how, <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=3258.37s">How</a> often in practice do you see people taking advantage of these height incentives and other places?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6203.576s">Yeah,</a> I know the buildings you're talking about they have been the subject of attention from both the city council and the planning department and particularly the economic development director for a good while now. <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6215.287s">The</a> short answer is that those buildings are owned by somebody who has a lot of property and wants people and wants whoever is going to rent it out to put up like $120,000 in capital for repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6228.5s">And</a> they're just willing to sit on it for however long they need to because they just don't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6233.045s">And</a> the city is basically the powers that the city has right now is to either do nothing or condemn it, which is like a nuclear option. <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6241.795s">So</a> we submitted a vacant building ordinance that, you know, I mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6248.703s">to</a> be honest, we're probably not going to get to working on it before budget season is over, just because we're going to be slammed with work. <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6254.267s">But</a> we, but Councilor Lazzaro and I did put that through and we're working with the Chamber of Commerce to give the city more sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6265.823s">middle</a> of the road tools to deal with situations like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6272.525s">It's</a> private property, so there's only so much we can do, but it does allow us to do things like tell them that they have to put up public artworks instead of just having those boards right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6284.188s">And</a> it says that they have to pay a yearly fee that's slightly higher than what they'd normally pay just to maintain that vacancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6290.67s">Again,</a> we want to <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6292.09s">get</a> the Chamber of Commerce on board with everything we're going to write in that before we actually pass that. <a href="https://youtu.be/LX1_uV95d6w&t=6299.516s">But</a> that's definitely an ongoing thing that we've heard a good amount about.

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3267.435s">I</a> was just gonna echo Council President Bears's sentiments and saying that thanking the residents for coming out here and advocating. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3277.635s">on</a> behalf of this clear case of noise and light pollution. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3280.676s">I</a> remember during the campaign when I was going around knocking doors, I spoke to a fellow on Circus Street, who's like right next to the commuter rail line, and he was talking about noise pollution, just keeping him up all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3298.879s">And</a> I think the solution to that would have been installing a sound barrier, which could have been <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3306.942s">you</a> know, very pricey but I <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3310.313s">hope</a> that they'll be able to do that but I mean this case especially after looking at your photos just it just seems very addressable like turn down the noise at three in the morning and uh you know don't have don't don't have uh the lights as bright as they are at that time period and I think that's that's what's particularly frustrating to me is that this just doesn't seem like one of those problems that takes like a lot of money to solve it just really takes <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3340.133s">and</a> a position of authority actually listening to you and acceding to these very reasonable requests. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3348.398s">So</a> I hope that we are able to get something out of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=3352.22s">Yeah,</a> this seems absurd.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4653.665s">Motion</a> to- This is vice chair or something, we all- I don't remember. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4661.027s">Planning</a> and permitting committee, vice chair that. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4662.908s">But</a> no, motion to suspend the rules and take 25-050 off the table.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4900.725s">Well,</a> Council President Bearst, I feel like this might not have been adequately explained before, but free cash is used for one-time expenses and the overrides were for ongoing expenses like salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4917.557s">So</a> I know that <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4919.4s">You</a> know, we here have not made that point sufficiently clear in the past, but the purpose of the overrides was to pay salaries, whereas this free cash is used for a one-time capital expense. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4934.305s">So</a> that's the distinction. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4936.486s">And</a> again, I understand that you may have not explained that just now, but I feel the need to say that myself.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=5941.133s">This</a> is something that I support. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=5945.557s">Questions</a> I had did relate to some of the, I do wish Lisa Davidson were still here to answer them, but I just wanted to ask if the Affordable Housing Trust had any <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=5962.909s">plans</a> to request any additional free cash appropriations to fund the affordable housing nexus studies, or if that's something that's sort of in the AHT's timeline or agendas in the near future?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=6019.66s">Yeah,</a> I understand that previously we received a recommendation to sell off land on McCormick, which didn't pass through this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=6029.286s">But</a> I would still like to see some communications or recommendations from the AHT on ways to fund that nexus study. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=6038.812s">And</a> it does seem like it would cost something like $80,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=6045.055s">So</a> I don't think that that's a whole lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=6047.917s">to</a> ask out a free cash for something this important. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=6051.418s">Again,</a> I know that this is outside of your purview. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=6053.839s">I</a> do wish Lisa were still on, but that's what's on my mind when regards to the HT these days. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=6061.44s">But</a> for the paper that we're actually discussing, I do support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=6066.762s">So</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=6067.722s">Thank</a> you for your work on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=6069.842s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Leming.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8008.791s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8010.691s">So</a> just to repeat what other folks have said, you said we should make this into a sanctuary city. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8017.993s">We</a> did a week before Trump took office. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8023.874s">We</a> just called it a welcoming city ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8025.934s">It's</a> the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8028.035s">So</a> with regards to the mayor's response, I think there's sort of the two sides to this, which clearly I'm on one side, but is that <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8041.244s">I</a> think that she doesn't want to be too public or out there about this because everybody's afraid of losing federal funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8048.333s">I</a> know that during Trump's first term, he attempted to revoke federal funding from sanctuary cities and it just got caught up in courts and ultimately failed. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8058.444s">I'm</a> not nearly as concerned about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8060.667s">And</a> I also just think that when you have, you know, federal government that's clearly turning into an autocracy, intimidation is a big part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8071.181s">And</a> it is important to stand up and just show that <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8075.95s">You're</a> not afraid. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8076.671s">I</a> know that's easier said for that's easier for some people to say than others. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8081.596s">So</a> I don't think that it's necessarily wise for every single person to speak out on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8087.662s">But</a> for those of us who are in a position where we can speak out on this and, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8093.268s">put</a> our voices out there to let us know that, let everybody know that that's not okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8096.931s">It's</a> important to do that and not be intimidated. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8100.174s">And</a> for those folks who feel like they might be more targets, they might be more of a target for this sort of a thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8108.141s">There</a> are a lot of <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8110.827s">political</a> organizing groups that are happening right now as a result of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8114.793s">Ice</a> watches are a thing that are forming around the community at the moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8120.781s">So</a> just people who are tracking the movements of ice officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8123.645s">I</a> was <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8127.39s">I</a> got a little bit of attention from the news personally because I'm the Secretary of the Democratic City Committee and we recently voted to approve 8,000 Know Your Rights red cards that we're currently in the early stages of trying to distribute out to nonprofits, churches, folks who have access to these sorts of communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8150.19s">So,</a> you know, I'm willing to appear on the news to show like what my opinions are as a local elected official because I don't think that I'm. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8157.503s">quite</a> at the same risk of being deported personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8160.025s">Um,</a> and it is, you know, it's important to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8164.048s">And,</a> you know, I received an unpleasant message from a right-wing nut job after I was publicly saying that I wanted to distribute these cards. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8173.676s">It's,</a> it's important to understand these people are paper tigers. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8176.679s">Most</a> of the time, you don't need to be scared of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8179.321s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8179.621s">It's</a> important to, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8182.543s">You</a> know, it's important to be outspoken to show <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8188.555s">to</a> show that you're not intimidated by what's happening and to organize against that. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8194.138s">We</a> are trying to do what we can at this level to stop that. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8199.841s">My</a> colleagues I know are involved in other efforts themselves around this, including resolutions that have been passed through these chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8206.965s">So,</a> so yeah, but I'd just like to thank you for coming out here to speak tonight and <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8217.743s">Yeah,</a> I think it's a very brave move on your part. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=8219.984s">So</a> thank you.<h2><a

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pMp24GBph-w&t=2818.385s">So</a> I had this question on my mind for a few minutes now, but conversation may have shed some light on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pMp24GBph-w&t=2826.075s">But</a> still, I'm curious. <a href="https://youtu.be/pMp24GBph-w&t=2827.176s">In</a> your head, what do you see as the biggest barrier to actually updating the financial software? <a href="https://youtu.be/pMp24GBph-w&t=2837.108s">The</a> upfront cost, the actual troubleshooting with procuring and integrating the new system, or is it training staff to use something new? <a href="https://youtu.be/pMp24GBph-w&t=2847.713s">Because</a> it seemed like those are the three things that you were talking about just now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pMp24GBph-w&t=2852.476s">Like,</a> which of those do you kind of dread when you think about doing this?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pMp24GBph-w&t=3028.961s">So</a> in terms of timing of this, do you think that a better timeline would be maybe when there ends up being a lot of new people coming into your department who are more willing to learn new systems? <a href="https://youtu.be/pMp24GBph-w&t=3043.273s">Because</a> I'm just trying to think when would the best time for this be if the biggest barrier is staff learning to do something new.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pMp24GBph-w&t=3185.064s">Well,</a> I think where I'm getting at is that I'm not getting the impression that there will ever be a particular period in time where that will not be a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/pMp24GBph-w&t=3202.469s">So</a> unless we plan to continue using the same system forever, if there were a case that doing it 10 years down the line would be an ideal time, would be a better time to actually make this switch, and that's one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pMp24GBph-w&t=3216.037s">But</a> if you don't think that, but if switching over is always going to be a difficult process, even though we'll have long-term benefits,<h2><a href="../2025-04-16_xnzCAcrA2NE/2025-04-16_xnzCAcrA2NE.html">City Council Committee of the Whole 04-16-25</a></h2>

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=2025.892s">This</a> is just another shout of appreciation for you personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=2033.0s">You've</a> been a wonderful partner to this Council, especially in getting the word out about different municipal happenings to <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=2049.396s">the</a> elderly population method as well as providing just a really great social center for a lot of seniors in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=2058.701s">You're</a> also just like a very nice person generally, which I appreciate as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=2067.967s">Once</a> again, <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=2073.114s">I</a> do wish that we were able to give more funding to these programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=2078.856s">Having</a> a social worker to support the senior residents in our city is definitely something that I do wish we had more of. <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=2093.842s">But</a> with funding coming in from the federal government, it's another story. <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=2100.789s">No,</a> no, no, no questions about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/xnzCAcrA2NE&t=2104.25s">But</a> I just like to just like to thank you.

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1187.106s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1187.506s">I</a> do realize that we have a few other things to discuss regarding this but I would like to bring up some very last minute edits that I don't believe were discussed previously to previously in the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1208.495s">I</a> would like to make a motion to amend Article 3, Section 3.1 to delete the word consecutive, amend Section 4-1 to add subsection e to say no person shall be <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1227.625s">elected</a> to the office of school committee member for more than eight terms and to elect section two and then section two dash one to add subsection D to say no person shall be elected the office of city councilor for more than eight terms. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1245.068s">It</a> was pointed out to me that the survey that was put out by the charter study committee, which we have discussed a lot here, but <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1253.637s">that</a> I think they did have a skewed sample, but still a majority of respondents did say that they would like to see term limits for city councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1269.201s">We</a> have term limits for the mayor in there, so I would like to motion to add in the eight term limits, so a total of 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1280.598s">years</a> in order to keep that consistent. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1286.941s">And</a> I would also like to delete the word consecutive just because I think that it is the case from, I did a bit of research on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1300.587s">It</a> is the case that in other municipalities, they do have a ban against <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1306.664s">multiple</a> consecutive terms, but I, from what I've seen, it's mostly like other municipalities more commonly have 12 year limits on these sorts of positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1317.529s">So</a> there is, so you can have, serve for 12 years, be forced to take break and then continue serving. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1322.531s">But</a> in this case, we'll have 16 year limits. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1325.752s">And</a> so I think that I just, I just feel like having that <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1331.755s">having</a> somebody serve for 16 years, take a break for two or four years and serve another 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1336.161s">It</a> doesn't really make sense to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1340.808s">But</a> anyway, that's my motion.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1350.052s">Remove</a> a consecutive from 3-1-C. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1353.533s">It</a> was, sorry, it was, I'll check just to make sure that I have my sections right, but it was essentially to, the intent of the motion is to make it so that currently the way it's written is, I believe it says, although I may, I believe I was looking at the latest version, but it says that the mayor can't serve
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1389.784s">Which</a> is kind of a different discussion but the, the other part of the motion was essentially to add on term limits for school committee members and okay city councilors so is there a specific so you would amend to one. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1404.337s">Yes,</a> so section 2.1 add subsection D to say no person shall be elected to the office of city council for more than eight terms, which a total of 16 years in that case. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1417.2s">And</a> section 4.1 to add in subsection E to say no person shall be elected to the office of school committee member for more than eight terms.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1440.304s">I</a> can split into separate motions if we want to discuss it.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=1447.769s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3270.031s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3271.611s">I'll</a> just briefly state my case about the Mayor on School Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3279.233s">I</a> did write a pretty lengthy post to my website about the process of this charter review. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3288.776s">I'm</a> not going to summarize the whole thing here. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3290.677s">It's</a> nuanced. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3292.557s">I've</a> had a lot of thoughts about it that have <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3296.322s">that</a> have changed over time, particularly since December. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3301.486s">If</a> you're interested in reading about that, just mattLeming.com. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3306.603s">I</a> don't think anybody's a bad guy here. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3308.204s">I</a> respect everybody on the charter study committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3311.665s">I</a> respect the mayor, school committee, my colleagues, but I did outline some of my issues with that process in that post. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3330.873s">Again,</a> not gonna try to summarize all of it right here, but this is just a case where <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3336.467s">people</a> who want to do what they think is best for the city are disagreeing on what that is and the means of getting there. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3344.209s">And</a> I think that's where we're at right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3348.39s">And</a> that's how I see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3351.411s">With</a> the mayor and school committee issue, just the reasons I think are one, charter study committees on survey said it was the more popular decision with the respondents to keep the mayor off <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3366.787s">of</a> school committee, it was pointed out to me that council term limits was also very popular. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3372.732s">Just</a> took a vote on that, didn't pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3374.614s">So</a> I do, but I do, after thinking about that argument, I do agree that we should have term limits. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3382.34s">I</a> also recognize that current and former school committee members, including my colleague here, as he's just expressed, do disagree on the mayor being on school committee issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3393.809s">There</a> are a lot of pros and cons against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3397.856s">The</a> ones who are against it have expressed to me the argument that Councilor Tseng just expressed in which they say that it can be very, it can lead to a lot of conflicts of interest behind the scenes, particularly in union negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3418.243s">I</a> also do have sympathy for the school committee members that I have spoken with who don't want to <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3427.177s">publicly</a> or as publicly express their position that the mayor shouldn't be on school committee because I think it's very easy being on school committee to say that you want the mayor to be on school committee because then you are supporting the position of your colleague but saying that you don't want the mayor to be on school committee is a little bit more difficult because that that can end up burning bridges. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3449.701s">So</a> I <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3453.582s">I</a> have taken current and former school committee members' views on this into account. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3458.866s">I</a> do think there needs to be a stronger balance between the mayor, the council, and the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3464.029s">Currently,</a> this charter, plan A strong mayor system, I think it does give the mayor a lot far too much power. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3469.812s">And</a> this kind of resets the balance there. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3478.377s">Besides</a> chairing the school committee, <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3480.655s">I</a> don't think that the mayor, and this is just hearing from what other members have told me, I don't think the mayor has a whole lot of time to really dedicate to the day-to-day work of running the school system just because of time commitment issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3494.347s">And</a> so having the mayor off does give one extra person there. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3498.65s">The</a> other, and last, I know it's a trend to have the mayor on school committee in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3503.935s">It</a> is the default setup under Massachusetts general law. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3508.968s">To</a> have that six school committee member with the mayor's chair setup. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3513.751s">That's</a> not the case in other states, and I think if other states have a setup like that, like can survive with different setups and I think, and I think Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3524.696s">can</a> as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3526.057s">Again,</a> it's not it's not like no other state has the mayor on school committees just that this is not a uniform picture and so there are different systems in different localities. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=3536.161s">That's</a> why I'll be voting to keep the mayor off school committee, and thank you everybody for listening.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=9016.917s">I</a> just wanted to point out for those interested in the learning about the history of the last charter review the Charter Study Committee provided some wonderful newspaper clippings in their in their website which has <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=9035.618s">just</a> some descriptions of the last effort to have a Charter Review Commission, I believe in the 70s, and other newspaper articles from 86 that talk about the chart that passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=9047.905s">So</a> if you want to read about a little bit of history, it's on the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/j2zlMvp6B6U&t=9053.188s">I</a> did appreciate that in their notes.<h2><a href="../2025-04-15_D8GJAXbG9Ig/2025-04-15_D8GJAXbG9Ig.html">City Council Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee 04-15-25</a></h2>
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=236.034s">Check</a> mic one, two, check mic one, two. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=262.577s">Welcome,</a> we'll now have a meeting of the resident services and public engagement committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=269.281s">The</a> sole topic that we will be discussing is amending and approving the budget survey, which will go out to guys guys, which will go out to collect feedback from residents on the budget process. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=289.832s">We're.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=293.773s">No,</a> I will not accept disruptions from Council President Bears, who I remind everybody is not a member of this committee, but seems to be intruding on our affairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=309.227s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=309.448s">So</a> the only feedback that I found that I believe was sent in that I saw was a, and I will just go ahead and share. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=321.263s">share</a> my screen really quickly just so everybody knows what I'm looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=326.345s">The</a> only piece of feedback that I saw was this very nice infographic from Councilor Callahan, which basically shows a breakdown of Medford's budget in a wonderful pie chart. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=341.573s">Most</a> of it's education, insurance, pensions. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=345.616s">And</a> I feel like that does a great job of clarifying to residents what kind of budget we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=355.543s">Absolutely,</a> Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=358.586s">I</a> will, one moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=361.007s">How</a> do I do this again?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=402.948s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=403.388s">Well,</a> I personally think that's that an updated version of this would be very useful to residents along with probably just the total numbers in there as well just for instead of percentages if that's possible to add like.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=417.836s">What?</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=419.937s">Uh</a> I'll let Councilor Lazzaro go first. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=428.781s">I'm</a> seeing.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=431.082s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=431.342s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=431.522s">Yep.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=449.958s">And</a> we have another who would like to speak, who is not a member of this committee, but I suppose we can let him speak anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=457.48s">I</a> think, yeah, whatever you guys want.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=617.596s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=625.083s">So</a> I just, the notes I took were that to put the fixed costs in a pop out of the pie chart to clarify and separate the trash line item from the DPW since that's a fixed cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=639.814s">Also</a> just like put in a text explanation of the chart, but I think that's obvious. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=645.618s">And</a> to put in the actual dollar amounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=656.238s">Okay,</a> so Council Gowan, do you think you'd be able to do that, do that on your own since.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=665.084s">All</a> right, cool. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=665.744s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=668.606s">See</a> the only other suggestions that I sort of had and I, I just, I essentially jotted down things that I would like to see from that I think are interesting pieces of information to have from residents <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=681.004s">But</a> I'm not 100% sure if it's appropriate to put out in a municipal survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=687.365s">But</a> I would like to have a demographic question about household income in there, like household income brackets. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=700.608s">The</a> other thing is a question about <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=705.621s">And</a> again, these can be phrased differently but the intent of the question is what one time city projects do you think what one time projects you think the city ought to fund the idea behind that being, you know that we have free cash and some idea of how the residents would like to spend things like that would be useful. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=725.667s">And</a> this is more just things that I'm interested in. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=731.734s">I</a> would like, I was thinking it would be interesting to have some questions about whether or not residents favored the tax override but again I'm not that that's one that I've kind of been like going back and forth on whether we would put that out just some sort of opinion on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=752.888s">The</a> last question that I was interested in knowing about from residents, there's this sort of idea that in cities you can have low taxes or you can have <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=770.788s">more</a> and stable city services or you can build up the density of the city in order to increase commercial revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=778.192s">So</a> those sort of three factors right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=782.254s">And</a> so I wanted some kind of a question that would rank residents preferences on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=788.897s">So</a> do they think that lower taxes are more important than keeping density? <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=797.077s">than</a> keeping density low, or do they think that city service, they'd be willing to pay more taxes in order to have more city services. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=806.345s">These</a> are just things I would be interested in getting information on generally, but obviously, these are just items that we can discuss.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=978.837s">a</a> map of, like a map of Medford, just the borders, and then put the words Wellington, Glenwood, South Medford, just on the map, but not actually specify the borders.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1035.698s">Did</a> you put your mic on?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1129.749s">I'm</a> really up in arms about that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1135.292s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1136.733s">So</a> I'm just going to refresh this here.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1153.638s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1155.479s">I</a> mean, I just don't think that household income is like that non-standard of a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1160.423s">It's</a> not a crazy question to ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1163.345s">But</a> yeah, like it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1165.187s">It</a> is. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1166.948s">It's</a> good context, I guess.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1180.498s">Do</a> I hear any objections to <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1184.71s">speak</a> now forever, hold your peace. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1186.911s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1190.293s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1193.014s">Maybe</a> by like tax brackets. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1195.455s">I</a> mean, well, so the tax brackets are like zero to 11,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1212.548s">11,000,</a> 47,000, 47, 100, 100 to 191, 191 to 243, 243 to 609, and then 609 or above. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1214.089s">President</a> Bears, I was just going to say for simplicity's sake, maybe zero to 50, 50 to 100. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1218.05s">Oh</a> yeah, you don't have to do like the full 47, 47 to 100, but yeah.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1251.944s">Yeah,</a> well, maybe like 0 to 15,000, 15,000 to 50,000, 50,000 to 100, 100 to 200, 200 to 600, then 600 plus.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1283.405s">If</a> y'all billion now. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1292.193s">Michael</a> Bloomberg, what do you think about the Medford budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1296.015s">Okay,</a> well, yeah, I'll leave it to your discretion whether to put the 600 plus in there or not, but I feel like those other brackets are fairly reasonable and they're at least based on some sort of a standard. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1310.404s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1316.16s">Well</a> the first income bracket is zero to 11,600. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1319.884s">So</a> I just figured but we could we could round it to 25 if you think that would be more appropriate.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1358.386s">Okay,</a> so people don't think about their.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1370.93s">Not</a> to get too technical. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1374.733s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1375.973s">So</a> those numbers, whatever they were, sounded great to me.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1406.09s">So</a> I guess with the override thing and the ranking of density versus high versus low taxes versus city services, the intent of that question is to try to form some kind of an inquiry where we could figure out what residents prefer to. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1431.276s">spend</a> less in taxes, or would they prefer to get more services in the future because it is it is a trade off, and I earnest. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1442.838s">No,</a> no, no, no, this is one where this is what we're just discussing so this is one of my one of my submissions and I'm trying to think of a way to phrase the question in a way that doesn't sound like weird on a municipal survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1454.167s">But</a> I would like to, I would like to get an idea because I hear a lot of residents around the city, particularly during the override campaign we're saying, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1463.813s">We</a> want to we want to pay more to invest in our schools than their other residents who are saying well we, you know, we're fixed income households and we don't want to pay extra pay extra taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1475.617s">And</a> so, the intent of the question is to try to figure out from respondents, what their sort of rankings. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1484.132s">like</a> what their priorities are, so to speak.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1559.061s">Well,</a> yeah, I understand though that that is like, um, that could be a bit of an out of place question, but it was something I was personally curious about. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1565.783s">So</a> if we don't think that it's, it has a place in the survey, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1569.345s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1573.283s">Yeah,</a> that was basically all I had.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1578.848s">Does</a> anybody else have any suggestions for this survey?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1633.639s">Well,</a> maybe once we have word-based Councilors, it'll be more of a personal relationship going on there.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1704.788s">Also,</a> just a note there, some of these are checkboxes when they should be radio buttons. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1709.791s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1713.573s">Option</a> five.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1737.973s">Also</a> include URLs to these things Councilor Callahan.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1792.993s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1796.774s">I</a> like that phrasing of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1800.975s">Councilor</a> Lazzaro?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1911.784s">Councilor</a> Lazzaro.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1968.204s">I</a> am all for using this survey, both to gather feedback and to essentially use it as an advertisement for the things that we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1982.101s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1983.682s">So</a> Councilor Tseng, what do you, with your schedule, what do you think is the, yeah, there's like a budget tab under. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1990.686s">What</a> do you think is the timeline you'll be able to get this out by? <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=1994.388s">Pretty</a> soon.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2002.333s">All</a> right, cool. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2002.854s">And</a> then just get all that and then start blasting it on social media.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2097.299s">Maybe</a> like, what is your favorite way of participating?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2110.885s">Well,</a> this is a radio. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2115.508s">This</a> could be like a checkbox, like which methods would you most likely.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2128.511s">It</a> should definitely be a checkbox thing, because I would rather read the city council newsletter than call my elected officials, since I only have to choose one. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2137.873s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2170.7s">Councilor</a> Tseng, I forgot, are you able to put URLs in the checkboxes?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2181.468s">I'm</a> pretty sure you can in the description. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2185.912s">In</a> the description, I think you can. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2187.853s">If</a> you go back to the first page. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2190.535s">I</a> mean, in the questions themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2192.597s">I</a> know you can't because I just did it for something else, but I mean in the checkboxes, like the checkbox text itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2201.058s">It</a> would be good if you could have reading the city council's newsletter and then you have a link right there to the latest one.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2220.11s">Wonderful.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2226.214s">Oh,</a> what a beautiful newsletter. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2240.577s">I</a> posted the latest newsletter to the website yet.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2251.463s">Well,</a> you could. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2252.023s">I</a> mean, it doesn't have to be like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2254.565s">You</a> could highlight it, then click put URL in there, and then just say click here or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2262.069s">You</a> don't have to include the full URL.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2272.685s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2273.305s">Oh.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2273.606s">No,</a> we could discuss this later if you share edit access with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2277.288s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2277.868s">I</a> could do that particular part.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2359.482s">Depends</a> on how many responses we could get in that two-week time period. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2376.938s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2379.84s">Is</a> there any other recommendations from councillors? <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2386.284s">Justin,</a> are you good?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2391.467s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2394.268s">Now</a> we will have public participation.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2405.751s">Use</a> this. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2407.273s">I've</a> always dreamed of leaving my council chair and then participating in public. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2411.977s">It</a> would be the strangest sight ever, but we can do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2416.482s">Do</a> we have any motions on the floor? <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2419.064s">Do</a> we have a second to that motion?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2429.08s">Okay,</a> motion to do we have a motion to approve and distribute and adjourn.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2446.671s">Okay,</a> so the motion is to approve the survey as discussed here. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2452.914s">Request</a> that the city administration use their channels to distribute it and adjourn.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2462.999s">No,</a> I didn't make them. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2464.24s">Oh,</a> yeah.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2466.841s">Yeah,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2468.002s">Yeah,</a> Councilors are seconded. <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2470.423s">Wonderful.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/D8GJAXbG9Ig&t=2470.923s">Mr.</a>

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3083.785s">Sorry,</a> I was used to the green thing coming up, but it just went straight to red, so I'm not sure.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3090.771s">I'm</a> not sure what the system is. <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3093.613s">No,</a> I just got to note that whole area, not only that triangle, but I think some of the houses along right next to the train tracks on <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3108.021s">like</a> Tyler Avenue, it's a little bit of a weird area for a bunch of reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3112.305s">I'm</a> thinking like, I mean, this is outside the scope of this, but even trying to make some ways so that that dead end isn't sort of a dead end, but actually like leads across the river, that would be a nice future construction project. <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3127.298s">I</a> don't know about the feasibility of that, but I feel like that area would require <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3134.669s">particular</a> focus. <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3136.57s">I</a> know that even the residents along, yeah, I was just kind of thinking about this like weird little corridor along, this weird little street on Tyler Avenue because I know the residents there have like a lot of issues with train noise as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3158.213s">So</a> I was trying to think of ways to like maybe <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3162.32s">do</a> something with like sound barriers, but I don't think that's like that just came up a lot, but I'm not 100% sure if that's something we could really solve with zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3170.626s">But</a> yeah, I do feel like just walking around this driving around this area tends to be a very strange experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=3177.73s">So</a> any additional focus on it would be welcome.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7IncPtSEWk4&t=5244.923s">Yes.</a>

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=1509.807s">Thank</a> you, Council President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=1511.849s">We</a> discussed increased public outreach for the budget process and that involved a, we passed a motion to collect feedback for a budget survey, which will be meeting on to approve at the next Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=1533.987s">Uh,</a> next week we had the human rights commission ordinance on the agenda, but decided to, uh, it needed more time for Councilor Tseng to work on it with the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=1547.873s">So,</a> uh, put it off until the next, until next month. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=1552.635s">And</a> we worked on and released, uh, the city council newsletter. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=1556.637s">Thank</a> you to councilor Callahan for drafting that.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5017.141s">I'd</a> like to thank you as well for putting this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5022.353s">Scary</a> and disgraceful that we're having federal authorities pick up students from the street, plainclothes officers, deporting them out of state so that they don't have access to legal representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5043.001s">And</a> in many other cases, even just putting them out of the country and ignoring court orders. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5051.337s">just</a> because they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5054.298s">Elections</a> have consequences, and this is what we're seeing because of the election. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5058.9s">I</a> mean, in other parts of the country, it's not... Ramesa Ozturk was a case that received a lot of publicity. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5068.363s">I</a> worked for five years as a postdoc at Mass General. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5072.324s">I</a> attempted <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5076.047s">Keyword</a> attempted, didn't succeed to unionize over there, but ended up creating some groups that had a lot of postdocs on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5085.769s">And</a> a lot of them are international. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5088.35s">And</a> so they're coming up with a report. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5089.53s">And</a> so they're sharing reports of people they know, their friends just being randomly abducted, detained in places like Cambridge, Chelsea, Everett. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5100.81s">Maldon.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5102.071s">Last</a> night, the Democratic City Committee met and decided to put some of the committee's own funding into purchasing 8,000 red cards, which are cards that you can give out to immigrants who may be at risk of being detained in order for them to understand their legal rights and understand how they <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5130.553s">can</a> interact when federal authorities try to illegally detain them. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5137.221s">In</a> many cases, there have also been reports of just US citizens being detained because they're brown. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5143.068s">And</a> then ICE will only figure that out later. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5147.31s">when</a> they go through their wallet and figure out that they were just randomly abducted. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5153.796s">And</a> what's going on here is that ICE is basically just taking in anybody that they can, trying to figure out if there was ever any lapse in Visa or anything that they might have done technically wrong on a piece of paper, and then using that as an excuse to deport them all while ignoring court orders <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5173.516s">to</a> the contrary, and then publicizing the few cases where they actually do manage to deport a violent criminal, and then using those few cases as justification for this policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5187.584s">So,</a> it is important, I agree for city leaders to speak up vocally because intimidation is a big part of this intimidation is the name of the game here that is a huge reason why this is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5206.501s">Independence</a> at different levels of government can help to stop this, but understand that being vocal and vocally saying this isn't right is the best tool that we have to stop an authoritarian regime. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5223.455s">So</a> again, I would just like to thank my colleague for putting this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5232.21s">and</a> I look forward to voting in favor of it and hearing whatever public comment we have.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8061.838s">So</a> just with the with the citations question, I would repeat, you could Google it, I would advise that you go to a somewhat reputable news source for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8072.023s">I</a> personally released a blog, mattLeming.com slash blog. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8078.686s">And</a> if you there's my most recent post was called resisting ice. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8083.108s">And</a> I understand that <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8085.131s">I</a> would like to thank all five people who actually read my blog, but I take pride. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8090.176s">And</a> I take pride in how many URLs I link to throughout the text there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8097.223s">And</a> so there is plenty of cases that relate. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8103.449s">There</a> are plenty of articles linked there that relate to detaining Brown people, <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8109.547s">women</a> describing detention centers as hell on earth, people dying, particularly the detention center in Miami. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8115.972s">So</a> it's out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8117.674s">I</a> mean, if you're only news sources like Fox News, then you're not gonna see it, but just kind of go outside of that a little bit and you'll get a lot more information. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=8126.941s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9516.528s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9521.813s">I'll</a> second Councilor Collins motion if if it needs a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9528.117s">So,</a> I did write, I did, I wrote up a speech here or like just like more like listing out my thoughts on this whole process because I was, again, I was originally a member of the of the Charter Study Committee and <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9547.541s">When</a> I started my campaign for city council, I was asked to step down. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9553.003s">And</a> you could read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9555.685s">You</a> could read it on my blog. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9557.405s">I</a> believe Mr. Gianvina here quoted my own blog at me during public comment when I sort of expressed blank check support for the work of the Charter Study Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9575.913s">And</a> I'm going to talk about that a little bit because I feel like this is probably the forum to have a little bit of discussion about this process as a whole and sort of how I think my opinions about how things have played out. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9595.745s">So</a> two years ago, I was a member of the Medford Charter Review Coalition. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9601.533s">This</a> was an advocacy group that lobbied city council to pass a petition for a home rule charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9608.018s">At</a> the time, they were lobbying city council to pass this petition so that Medford could elect a charter review commission that would be elected directly by voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9622.569s">And</a> at the time, city council had four members that were in favor of charter review and three that were strongly against. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9628.834s">And</a> the petition was rejected. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9632.08s">And</a> then around the time that I joined the Medford Charter Review Coalition subsequently tried to collect the requisite signatures to initiate a homeroom petition process directly, building off of the many signatures that were collected by former school committee member Michael Ruggiero. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9649.368s">But</a> we failed to collect those signatures. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9651.009s">And</a> then after that, <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9654.025s">the</a> mayor then formed the 11-member Charter Study Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9658.587s">And</a> this is a group of Medford residents that the mayor appointed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9661.048s">They're</a> appointed at her discretion. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9663.529s">They</a> didn't have, they weren't confirmed by city council, even though it was known throughout the process that council was the body that would eventually have to vote on the charter draft. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9673.054s">Now,</a> I know, I understand why <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9676.859s">like,</a> if I had to guess, I'd say that the reason that they weren't confirmed by Council explicitly was because, again, at the time, about <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9686.918s">almost</a> half of the council was very opposed to the very idea of charter review. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9692.861s">But</a> we had the 11-member study committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9694.983s">I</a> was one of the original members of the charter study committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9697.324s">And</a> I think the mayor's intent when forming this committee, which she has expressed more privately than others, was to have sort of an ideological balance, mixing progressives and conservatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9707.99s">About</a> 50-50 conservatives are outnumbered in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9712.573s">But</a> what she has said was that the idea was to have it <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9716.475s">have</a> an ideological balance when composing the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9719.616s">I</a> wasn't aware of that at the time when I was put on the COC. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9722.698s">I</a> was, I believe it was four members of the Charter Review Coalition that were appointed there and other community members and membership did circulate over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9731.361s">So</a> I stepped down. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9732.982s">The</a> other co-chair at the time stepped down. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9735.143s">Other</a> people have had to step down. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9736.403s">Others</a> were appointed to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9737.304s">So</a> the composition has changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9740.085s">When</a> I announced my campaign for city council, I was asked <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9743.772s">by</a> the mayor, by others to step down from the Charter Study Committee because I was told involvement from the city council would be a conflict of interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9752.076s">I</a> disagreed with this, but when somebody that appointed you to a committee asks you to step down, you do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9760.641s">I</a> didn't want to create any controversy early on my campaign. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9764.283s">And</a> during my campaign, I expressed full support for the work of the Charter Study Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9770.027s">I</a> think that a lot of that was to sort of bolster the public standing of the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9775.288s">I</a> hadn't still had good relationships with people, and I had faith in the work that they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9785.33s">And</a> I really want to see a new charter pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9788.551s">And</a> again, when you have half the council hostile to the idea of charter review, it's really important to try to bolster up the committee that really wants it to pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9802.485s">Hearing</a> some of the feedback from the committee, like in this seat, on their justifications for some of the aspects of city council and school committee composition, I don't know if I've been always satisfied with what's been presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9820.015s">I've</a> been very pleased with most of the other work there, but I also thought that, like, <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9826.669s">the</a> more drama that we have surrounding the study committee, which is not a negatively affect the chances of charter you to pass the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9835.055s">I'm</a> going to talk a bit about conflicts of interest here, which was something that has come up in public comment so in changing a document as important as a charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9842.978s">conflicts</a> of interest are going to be part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9845.88s">So</a> the draft of the charter before us, the one that the mayor just passed back to us has very minor edits that substantially put more power, more in favor of the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9860.811s">um</a> and takes it away from city council and balance of powers is important here and I think and I think it's and even the original draft that was handed to us had had small edits like the charter the periodic charter review committee having over half of those appointees be be mayoral appointees I think that having this is natural because you know you did have a study committee that was appointed with uh without council input I think that these conflicts uh are these sort of conflicts of interest with elected officials and <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9890.632s">groups</a> that they appoint are why the state outlines a process for the Home Rule Commission of nine members to be elected directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9897.819s">I</a> mean, this is the cleanest way to not have elected officials involved in making decisions surrounding their own process. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9904.766s">Again,</a> Medford tried to do this twice and failed because initiating the Home Rule Charter position is <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9913.009s">very</a> difficult in itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9915.11s">You</a> need to collect something like around 6,000 signatures, I think, and that's just hard to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9921.753s">And</a> when this cannot be done, approval of the charter by many groups of elected officials is the second best option, because elected officials, while they are <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9931.417s">making</a> decisions about their own positions are at least chosen by the voters and so representative of the city at a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9937.941s">Our</a> positions are more or less transparent to the city and we groups of elected officials have a pretty good understanding of city matters and ordinances that most members of the public aren't really as privy to. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9953.31s">This</a> is why changes to the Constitution of the United States require both congressional approval and ratification from state legislatures, you need many groups of people elected by the voters of the United States to approve that the President cannot himself just change the Constitution. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9968.704s">With</a> that in mind, and this is a part where I've really done my work in the past couple of weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9974.927s">And</a> again, I understand the political context at the time the formation the formation of the charter study committee was pretty unusual. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9982.849s">Most</a> other municipalities have they varied in their exact methods for appointing a similar study committee or a charter review committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9991.112s">It's</a> almost universal that city council or the equivalent body is involved in the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9995.095s">School</a> committees often are as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=9996.916s">Many</a> cities have had Councilors and school community members on their charter review committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10002.419s">There</a> are a few home rule charters where elected officials are explicitly banned from serving on this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10008.963s">But</a> in those cases, it's inevitably city council who appoints members of the review body because it is city council which will eventually have to approve that draft. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10019.811s">Again,</a> I know why the mayor made the decision to not have a CSC confirmed by this council, nearly half of them were hostile at the time the very idea of charter abuse some understanding of the particular decisions made a particular times, and I think that the Charter Study Committee has worked extremely hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10036.56s">in</a> in their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10038.782s">I</a> think that I personally think that especially after the 2024 elections when uh most like I think every member every member of the council right now is favorable to the idea of charter review um I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10055.778s">we</a> should have been more involved in the drafting of the process, again, in other municipalities. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10061.225s">Sometimes</a> Councilors are even on the Charter Study Committee itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10066.172s">That,</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10072.872s">The</a> mayor, so the mayor in the current draft nixed the council's proposal to change 38254, but the reason that I just seconded Councilor Collins' motion is that all along they decided to keep the mayor on the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10086.254s">And</a> this is something that bugs me because the charter study committee surveys showed that the public strongly disagreed with this choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10095.636s">I</a> don't think that this exactly would have been a decision if the committee had been elected directly by voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10102.348s">Um,</a> again, because it is clearly, according to their own surveys, the most popular decision have the mayor removed from the CSC entirely. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10111.991s">But</a> it was a committee that was appointed by the mayor, so it does make sense with that in mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10117.252s">Um,</a> I also think that the exclusion of council would have been more acceptable to me if the edits that we had made and approved six to zero <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10132.488s">would</a> have been accepted. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10136.11s">And</a> with the fact that we only had three months to do this in mind, whereas the Mayor and Charter Study Committee had two years to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10148.556s">But</a> I do disagree with this process that we are given a new draft of the charter <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10158.318s">one</a> which we've made very relatively like I mean substantial but still like relatively minimal edits to with a very limited timeline and we're given it one week before uh we're supposed to approve it via press release and I only received red line edits to act to know which amendments actually were made uh when I saw the council agenda so <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10185.838s">I'm</a> aware of the timeline that we're on. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10188.799s">I</a> would also really like to see it get on the ballot this November. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10193.501s">So</a> here's the thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10212.273s">I</a> would be willing to go, I think that when this council voted on the draft of the charter that we voted on six to zero, we were voting for what we believed is the best policy and a policy that we believe would also be accepted by the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10227.1s">It</a> does bug me that in the only part of the process where another elected body did make edits, we have other groups that are trying to just completely undo those edits. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10239.861s">on</a> this very limited timeline via press release. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10243.522s">So,</a> I would be more comfortable voting on a draft of the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10250.544s">I</a> think that the amendments that were given that were given by Councilor Lazzaro and were also mentioned by Councilor Collins do satisfy some of the concerns that I had previously with the red line that's made by the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10265.907s">I</a> would be willing to support <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10269.088s">3-8</a> if the mayor is also removed from the school committee because I think that shows some consistency. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10276.23s">Again,</a> that's what the public clearly said that they wanted and if we're going to go with policies that we think are the most popular with the voters, then I think that I see some head shaking there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10292.895s">It</a> was in their survey that people said they wanted to remove the mayor from the school committee, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10300.648s">OK,</a> yeah, yeah, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10301.728s">Sorry,</a> sorry.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10316.073s">So</a> I think it does show some consistency in going with the most popular decisions if we went with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10324.256s">So</a> again, as you can see, I am <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10329.621s">I</a> do commend the Charter Study Committee for all the work that they've put into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10336.424s">Obviously,</a> from what you can hear, I do have some concerns with the way the process went down. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10344.969s">And</a> the timeline issue is something that I'm dissatisfied with. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=10351.132s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11518.73s">Yeah,</a> just on that point, I don't think that anything we could do in this charter would affect our normal ability to initiate a home rule commission, which for clarity would be a group of people that are elected directly by voters who then draft another <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11540.333s">original</a> charter and then that is then sent to voters again. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11543.816s">I</a> think that there are, there are kind of two different, and the, and the special, and the, the once every 10-year committee that's in this current draft of the charter would be, it would do things like update the charter if state law changed and the charter needed to be consistent with it or if there were normal things that we needed to change in the charter to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11565.837s">Like,</a> you know, turned out that something wasn't working and they can make normal edits. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11571.243s">When</a> it came to like when it comes to think when it comes to the Home Rule Commission, it is important to clarify that they do have generally have more authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11579.552s">So,</a> I don't think that the state legislature would normally approve something like <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11586.653s">rank</a> choice voting, but if the Home Rule Commission put forth something that wasn't explicitly illegal, they could end up implementing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11597.321s">So</a> this doesn't take away the option explicitly. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11599.243s">I</a> think that there is an argument to be made as to whether or not having this continuing process would sap motivation for doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=11607.442s">in</a> the future, which there's kind of two different conversations to be had, but yeah.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12353.373s">I</a> completely agree with the point about timelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12357.035s">The</a> fact is, again, we got the draft of this about three months ago, three, four months ago, when it had been worked on for two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12369.141s">And</a> at that very limited timeline, we passed a version of this 6-0. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12375.844s">And</a> then a week ago, we got this version of the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12383.827s">A</a> week is not enough time to go through this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12386.589s">And</a> I personally do not care if this if we put it to the statehouse and it has to be delayed to the spring 2026 election. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12397.898s">Because</a> we the way I see it, we passed a charter, this body did our job, just like with the zoning, we put out a timeline beforehand, clarifying how that would play out. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12411.008s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12411.623s">In</a> January, we also the governance committee put out a timeline for how that play out that would play out, and we met that timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12419.276s">So,</a> I think, I think that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12423.989s">passing</a> a charter to us one week beforehand, again, via press release, is a strategy to try to rush this body into accepting edits without due thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12437.075s">And</a> it's not a strategy that I want to fall for. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12439.456s">I'm</a> going to support my colleagues if they want more time to think about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12447.46s">I</a> personally have had a pretty stressful week beyond this charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12452.002s">beyond</a> this charter business, and I can sympathize with the need for one more week to consider this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=12461.069s">And,</a> you know, it is what it is, again, if the getting a version of the charter to the State House were truly a high priority, you could have accepted the version of the charter that we pass six to zero.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=13205.482s">Please</a> pause. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=13207.489s">You</a> didn't you didn't mention anybody's name. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=13209.13s">It's</a> obvious that you're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=13211.231s">It's</a> obvious you're talking about me. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=13213.172s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=13213.552s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=13214.012s">At</a> the time, At the time, the Charter Study Committee was an appointed by was a body <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=13238.208s">At</a> the time, I had good relationships with people on the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=13243.272s">I'd</a> previously worked with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=13248.276s">I</a> really want to see Charter Review pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=13251.178s">And</a> when I was asked to step down from the committee after starting my campaign, I offered public support to the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=13263.672s">And</a> no, I did not say that it was because I wanted to better my relations with people in the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=13270.957s">No,</a> it's because increasing the visibility, increasing the faith that the community has in the Charter Study Committee would make it more likely that future councils would be more supportive of the idea of charter review. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=13286.967s">And</a> you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=13288.188s">It</a> worked. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=13290.901s">the</a> Charter Study Committee is now very popular and the work that they've done is now very popular with the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=13299.503s">And</a> when I was offering my comments just now, this is the reason that I've tried up till this point to say as little as possible that I could, because I am proud of the majority of work that the Charter Study Committee has done. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=13315.787s">And</a> I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=13318.972s">They</a> are a group that has worked extremely hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=13323.595s">But</a> I got to say that during some of the presentations that I have seen, it did not satisfy me. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=13333.923s">I</a> wish that the presentation specifically around <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=13337.534s">council</a> composition around the school committee that took place in these chambers could have been more substantive. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=13344.139s">I</a> wish that there were concerns consistently that Councilors brought up and that school committee members for that matter brought up, which were not addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=13356.829s">And</a> when I was bringing up my own concerns, and this is both in public and in one-on-one conversations, <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=13365.157s">I</a> was, I consistently ran into this attitude of you shouldn't be considering that or you shouldn't be considering this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=13370.921s">So,</a> so yeah, and it's tricky. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=13376.266s">It</a> is, it is, it's tricky for me because again, I did used to be part of that committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=13384.313s">And</a> so I do, I appreciate the work that they've done, but <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=13391.317s">I</a> do need to have, but I would be remiss if I said that I didn't have criticism of their work in certain areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=13401.004s">So</a> that's the only point I'm making. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=13404.206s">I</a> mean, I understand that it's easy to twist what I'm saying from the seat, but yeah, that's all.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=13980.126s">I</a> do have like a bit of a longer point that I wanna make about charter committee compositions.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=13987.793s">We've</a> talked for a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=13988.653s">I</a> have done my homework on this, that's the point I wanna make.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=14305.745s">Councilor</a> Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=14308.666s">So</a> if I said the committee as a body, I could go back on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=14316.388s">individual</a> committee members have spoken to this committee in their capacity as either the committee chair or the chair of individual subcommittees, and they've discussed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=14328.49s">But</a> you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=14330.551s">I</a> guess the committee technically disbanded after the recommendations were submitted, but individual committee members have discussed the process that they've gone through with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=14339.453s">But</a> you're correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=14340.373s">During</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=14341.58s">the</a> process of drafting the charter, and I'm not a member of the governance committee, so I might have missed this.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=14357.49s">Yeah,</a> Paul, I probably should have clarified the wording there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=14360.552s">But</a> yes, I hope you <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=14362.596s">people</a> that were the chair of individual subcommittees that focused on different parts of the charter did speak to us about that.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16110.527s">I'd</a> like to apologize ahead of time for subjecting everybody to this, but can I share my screen? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16116.902s">Okay,</a> yeah, so I actually kind of got into like, I was on a work trip a few weeks ago and I got into a research binge on this because, you know, I was kind of bored. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16128.947s">So</a> I just started looking up the composition of charter study committees in other municipalities, who appointed who. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16136.25s">The</a> real takeaway here is that there's not much of a pattern <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16142.164s">Um,</a> to it, like, I think that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16146.607s">I</a> was able to find three other instances in this list that a point where it was the executive of the town that appointed the charter study committee or the equivalent charter review committee themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16161.778s">And</a> that was, that was like a town manager or a town council president, like positions that did have. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16170.055s">The</a> that did have the executive that were in what's the executive did have like a lot more checks over from the legislative body, but in other municipalities, like I don't yeah there's not a 333 between mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16186.889s">council</a> and the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16188.85s">There</a> are some where the mayor gets more appointees. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16190.811s">There</a> are some where the council president and the councilors get and the mayor get equal appointees and the school committee doesn't appoint anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16201.615s">But</a> there are also there are also others where <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16205.167s">like</a> Mashpee, for instance, where each, the mayor, the council, and the school committee get equal appointees, and the appointees of other independent bodies are also there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16218.915s">In</a> all cases that I could find, there was involvement from the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16223.697s">Either</a> the city council appointed or confirmed the study committee, or they got their own independent appointees, which is outlined in the current draft of the charter, which we just amended back to 333. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16234.763s">I</a> do think that the school committee is affected by the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16242.891s">They</a> are largely governed by state law, but it does talk about the composition of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16248.296s">So</a> it is important for me personally to keep that balance of power. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16254.362s">So</a> yeah, I just wanted <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16260.038s">I</a> just wanted to have an excuse to finally share that spreadsheet with the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16265.641s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16303.904s">Yeah,</a> I was when I was apologies. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16307.685s">But</a> when I was making the spreadsheet, I was trying to I was trying to sort of like fit different towns of different types of government into into a format that sort of those sort of limiting for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16322.528s">I</a> attempted to note it when I didn't think that the strong mayor system was necessarily comparable to what you see in other municipalities. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16334.017s">And</a> again, this was more of a weekend project for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16340.941s">So</a> it's an imperfect piece of research, but I was doing a lot of reading about what I found in other areas.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16726.291s">Wow,</a> we still have more on this agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16728.493s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16732.497s">Yes,</a> so this was an ordinance proposal that was a while and making. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16740.206s">Lazar</a> and I received a message from the Chamber of Commerce, they received a lot of feedback that they're dissatisfied with some of the vacant storefronts, the continuously vacant storefronts, particularly in the West Medford area. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16757.288s">Currently</a> it's being sat on by a fellow who owns it and is expecting whoever decides to rent it out to pay a large upfront capital cost to repair the whole thing, and there's just really not a whole lot of tools. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16773.928s">that</a> the city has to be able to do anything about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16778.869s">What</a> this ordinance allows is for the building commissioner to create first a registry of businesses in order to keep track of vacant businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16787.872s">It</a> also has provisions in there to <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16795.074s">Enforcing</a> long term vacancies to put up public art so that the storefronts are more visually appealing which would help the area pretty substantially. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16807.33s">and</a> it would allow the city to charge a fee for maintaining this database to longer term vacancies. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16817.759s">This</a> is designed to, this is modeled off of the version of the same ordinance that they came up with in East Hampton. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16829.168s">So</a> I included in this agenda current draft language <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16834.698s">I</a> would further motion to send, just to expedite this, to send the draft language to legal for review to hear their feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16843.921s">I</a> would also motion to send this, as you said, to admin and finance so that we can have more discussions about this with the economic development director, the building commissioner, and the Medford Chamber of Commerce so that we can hear any potential edits that they may have to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=16862.547s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=17210.532s">Yes,</a> I'd like to thank you for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=17214.155s">A</a> lot of what I studied in grad school was autism. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=17221.122s">I</a> was in the psychiatry department over there, so this was a subject of research of mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=17228.428s">It</a> is early intervention. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=17234.112s">in</a> cases where the first symptoms of autism are showing up is huge for quality of life later on. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=17244.204s">And</a> I just want to express my appreciation for supporting proactive initiatives to get <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=17253.418s">to</a> get children with autism spectrum disorder off the wait list so that they can get treatment sooner because it will have substantial long-term effects. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=17261.885s">So</a> I will happily support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=17263.907s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=20192.57s">I</a> would just, I would just like to mention, I do understand the back and forth about sale of public land I would still like to support the recommendation of the affordable housing trust so that's, that's, that's my position but I respect the decisions made by my colleagues.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=20252.872s">Prepare</a> for my 45 minutes speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=20255.915s">No,</a> no I've spread. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=20267.192s">No,</a> no, no, no, I just, no, I just, I just want to mention that if this, if this does fail, then I would strongly urge that we pay for the nexus study with free cash of which, as we have seen, we do have enough free cash for <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=20285.871s">These</a> relatively minor capital allocations. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=20289.592s">I</a> still, I just want to be clear for my colleagues here that I, I do not think that it is appropriate to use free cash for operating expenses, but in the case of studies. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=20301.956s">It's</a> perfectly in case of one time studies, it's perfectly fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=20305.737s">Okay.</a> <h2><a href="../2025-04-03_zmO5WffK7aY/2025-04-03_zmO5WffK7aY.html">Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee Meeting via Zoom</a></h2>

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1199.644s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1200.905s">There's</a> Councilor Tseng told me that he's stuck in traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1205.307s">So</a> the first thing that will be working on tonight is the draft of the Medford City Council newsletter for the month of April. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1216.672s">For</a> the sake of editing, I'm just going to hold on a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1220.953s">I'm</a> just going to share my screen real quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1230.651s">Okay,</a> I just got a new computer, so there does seem to be a bit of an issue with the sharing at the moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1252.94s">Sorry,</a> just opening settings. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1271.258s">One</a> moment, I'm just gonna have to quit and reopen Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1274.138s">Again,</a> new computer, so I'm just trying to share my screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1292.682s">All</a> right, going back into Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1317.17s">All</a> right, here's to be good. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1322.312s">All</a> right, perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1329.536s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1334.599s">All</a> right, so we have a version of the Medford City Council newsletter, which was <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1344.904s">passed,</a> which was created by Councilor Callaghan. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1349.428s">I'm</a> seeing this paragraph here saying it was our first newsletter. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1356.413s">So,</a> oh wait, no, sorry, this is April 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1360.597s">No,</a> sorry, this was the, my apologies, I had the April 2024, this is the March 2025 version open. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1368.718s">bad</a> window. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1369.278s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1370.879s">Okie</a> dokie. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1371.82s">So</a> I'm also just going to, for this one, I'm just going to note here that we need to put in the note about the underlying words being <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1391.114s">So</a> yeah, we included, last time I know it, about the underlying words being linked to the previous newsletter. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1395.356s">Got</a> some, I believe Councilor Lazzaro had some notes from Councilor Tseng, who's running a little, who's stuck in traffic at the moment, saying he had some edits to the current draft of the newsletter. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1409.323s">If</a> you'd like to share those really quickly, and I could just do the edits here.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1444.269s">I</a> usually provide the hyperlinks during when I'm actually formatting. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1448.711s">I'm</a> not sure if he meant from the note that he just wanted us to provide hyperlinks to those documents, or if he wanted us to actually outline what individual, oh, he just, Councilor Tseng is here now.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1468.048s">Hello,</a> we were, Councilor Tseng, we were just talking about one of your notes to link to individual councillor requests for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1476.93s">Did</a> you mean just throw in hyperlinks during formatting or actually out?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1483.471s">Okay,</a> all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1484.051s">Well,</a> I usually do that during the, I usually just do that during the formatting process.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1492.9s">Make</a> a quick explanation of what the Salem Street Corridor District in the green score is. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1499.446s">Okie</a> dokie. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1501.067s">So,</a> the Salem Street Corridor District in the city's green score coordinates. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1507.854s">Maybe</a> something like... <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1545.315s">Does</a> that seem like a sufficient? <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1551.339s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1551.939s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1554.501s">And</a> since we're talking about budget, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1559.144s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1559.585s">And</a> then for budget outreach at the discussions included to do.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1595.14s">One</a> thing I also am wondering, so this is a slightly different formatting. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1600.222s">Normally</a> we would have like on March 4th and March 11th, blah, blah, blah happened, although the dates are noted here. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1608.985s">So</a> this is a little bit briefer, which is nice, but I'm wondering if the consistency of the format matters to anybody but me, Councilor Lazzaro.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1684.801s">Councilor</a> Callahan.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1696.328s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1698.47s">Sounds</a> good to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1701.472s">Cool.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1703.588s">And</a> then looking ahead in April, we'll bring more budget hearings, zoning proposals and resident engagement initiatives and encourage more residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1711.335s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1716.439s">Cool.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1719.442s">Any</a> other comments?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1725.287s">I</a> thought it was only the three comments, but, oh, right. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1730.865s">Sorry,</a> I was going through the numbered list, but then they stopped being numbered after a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1735.106s">No,</a> no worries. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1735.926s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1739.027s">Okey</a> dokey. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1739.988s">Yeah,</a> the other one is the money for the lead pipes as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1747.79s">Do</a> you remember which meeting that was at?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1818.96s">I</a> can pull that up too. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1822.661s">I</a> actually did get a note about the last newsletter. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1824.642s">The</a> reason it's on my mind is because somebody sent a note about the fact that it was phrased as repair and not repair slash replace. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1833.444s">And</a> I was just kind of thinking like, OK, well, this phrasing does make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1837.725s">So</a> thanks for remembering. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1840.466s">Got</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1843.447s">So</a> that's like celebrity repair statements, insurance, <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1866.402s">Oh,</a> Councilor Lazzaro.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1894.028s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1894.769s">So,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1896.07s">Yeah,</a> we need to include but that was the 1st of April.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1907.421s">So</a> what I've been doing for this is okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1910.223s">The</a> months aren't perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1911.344s">My</a> my rule of thumb is just to cover every event that we've had since the last newsletter. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1917.59s">So</a> up to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1922.258s">I</a> also generally fuse committee of the whole with the regular meetings, but whichever. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1946.765s">Councilor,</a> Councilor Lazzaro, would you, are you on the document right now?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=1954.413s">Could</a> you feel free to feel free to write out the language for that since you're the chair of the committee and driver behind the ordinance, I figure you'd probably.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2014.713s">This</a> is probably the most informal committee of all. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2017.255s">This</a> is probably the most informal committee of all the city council meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2021.138s">Y'all</a> are just like eating bagels and just kind of palling around over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2025.422s">This</a> is a serious chamber with serious stuff going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2031.987s">Y'all</a> gotta be more serious. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2037.312s">You're</a> eating blackberries?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2053.887s">Okay,</a> well. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2101.373s">All</a> right, Councilor Lazzaro, are you good with that?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2111.419s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2112.999s">Councilor</a> Tseng? President Bears?, you have the document on your computer, or do you want me to just like scroll through on this screen if you don't?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2124.519s">No,</a> I'm just wondering if like you, if you have a, if you're on the document or if you have a link.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2132.882s">No,</a> I think, I think we got, we got everything from your notes.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2152.55s">I</a> will say that during some of the formatting like this whole like bullet and sub bullet points could end up showing up weird on the latex when I'm doing two columns. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2162.317s">So</a> do whatever formatting. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2170.783s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2170.903s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2171.223s">Well</a> I'll just, I'll just change that really some. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2191.952s">Okay,</a> that's actually <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2224.122s">Discussions.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2244.142s">we</a> could either be... Sorry, can you speak up?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2275.001s">I</a> think we should hold a roll call vote on this important issue.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2285.448s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2285.989s">Again,</a> we can make this a midnight meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2289.251s">We</a> can do that if we really need to. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2293.374s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2314.741s">You</a> know, nevermind, I'll just keep it this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2316.322s">Okay,</a> does anybody else have any other additional edits they'd like to see? <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2330.833s">Do</a> we have a motion to approve?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2334.776s">Mr.</a> Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2377.086s">On</a> the affirmative, one absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2379.108s">The</a> newsletter is approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2382.832s">I'll</a> be working on the formatting of this as soon as I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2387.735s">Next</a> item. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2390.96s">So</a> we had on here a resolution to discuss the modernization of the Human Rights Commission's enabling ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2398.952s">This</a> year was put on the agenda largely as a <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2404.027s">uh,</a> preliminary measure in case, uh, Councilor Tseng, uh, had, uh, concluded his discussions with the mayor on this topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2415.993s">Um,</a> but it my understanding is that we probably need to wait another month before we could really move forward on this.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2574.677s">Okay,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2576.299s">Do</a> we have to make a motion on that or?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2592.628s">All</a> right, cool. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2596.791s">In</a> that case, moving on resolution for the public engagement plan for the FY 26 budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2609.302s">25-041</a> be it resolved that the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee design and implement a public engagement plan for the upcoming FY 2026 budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2617.907s">The</a> purpose of this is basically to get a couple of ideas on the table to talk about engaging the public a little bit more in our budget process, increase transparency,
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2853.048s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2855.469s">Any</a> comments from any of the councilors? <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2861.902s">I'm</a> personally, um, excited about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2865.799s">Is</a> there a <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2867.79s">In</a> previous years, when you did put out the survey, was it run entirely by individual Councilors or is there generally any city support for distributing the survey using the official city mailing lists or did Councilors just sort of put it out on their own social media channels?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2941.141s">Josh</a> Triplett Oh, seeing no other. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=2944.468s">So</a> are you planning on drafting a version of that and then presenting it at the next meeting or Yeah, like sending out sending us informally.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3032.722s">I</a> mean, the end result I want to have is that we end up having something solid to like something workable to vote on at the next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3042.332s">I</a> mean, personally, what I'd like to see out of any survey is pretty <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3051.515s">basically</a> a thorough collection of the demographic aspects just so that we know how balanced or in balance the feedback is, because I think a problem in previous surveys that have been put out by the city is that they have been quite a skewed sample. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3066.424s">So</a> that does tend to be a systematic problem in municipal surveys. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3073.708s">I</a> would also generally like to, I'm not really too sure if we should have like <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3084.568s">like</a> some kind of like a feedback section for like which departments people think should be funded or if it should just be sort of like general areas that they think should be emphasized. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3095.553s">Like,</a> do they think the school should be more funded? <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3097.434s">Do</a> they think, you know, what is your ranking when you're comparing like the Department of Health versus like, you know, do you think we should put more money into the planning department? <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3107.382s">something</a> like that, I guess a good starting point would really be just to see what, just if you have the previous survey on you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3152.635s">Sorry,</a> do you have like that on a screen that you could share?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3217.847s">Let</a> me, Councilor Lozada, I can see your hand raised.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3334.229s">you</a> send that to my email? <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3335.85s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3336.931s">Councilor</a> Callahan.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3462.24s">I</a> think that some sort of a, instead of having this very nice photo right here, probably having a pie chart.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3480.236s">It</a> does have to be something that we guarantee people see though. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3483.859s">It</a> is true that I'm not thinking of too many like, <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3487.316s">too</a> many ways to fully describe the city's budget and a Google dog banner, but it would be nice if that were achievable. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3495.439s">I'm</a> just kind of worried about the idea of having a separate document explaining the budget, or maybe it could be the first page of the survey.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3575.102s">All</a> right, hold on.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3592.295s">I'm</a> just going through the survey, survey on my own. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3614.165s">So</a> it does look like the previous survey was collecting demographic information, but it did mainly rely on, I think a lot of it relied on short-form answers, particularly on the first page.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3677.543s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3678.783s">No,</a> that makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3680.644s">Um,</a> so to clarify the way that, <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3683.733s">So</a> some of the specific suggestions for how to change it are to collect more, or to include more educational content within the survey itself, just about the nature of the budget, and be a little bit more detailed in the demographics that we're, demographic information we're collecting.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3732.402s">You</a> said you got like a hundred people last time.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3738.207s">What</a> were some of the main points of feedback then? <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3742.65s">Like</a> any trends you noticed?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3909.346s">I</a> have Councilor Tseng is, seems like he's, does have, like, a lot of experience with, a little bit more experience than I do than, <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3920.338s">I</a> would welcome him as the proposed co-sponsor as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3925.003s">We</a> could also discuss this offline since we're not, since, you know, we can.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3992.174s">Just</a> going to, I'm going to try to share that screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=3994.995s">I'm</a> going to try to do my best to share the screen and try to
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4055.859s">I</a> mean, I understand the point that you're making earlier about having open-ended questions, but the part of me that likes to save time is just thinking to take some of these and put them as a bullet points in the next, like put them as check boxes or rankings in the next version of the survey.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4108.569s">Um,</a> that's just my kind of like, at a curiosity, how much time did it take you to go through the 135 short form responses and come up with this?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4189.193s">I'm</a> looking at this right here.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4198.501s">I</a> mean, yeah, it does remind me of the charter study committee survey, which was just like that sort of similar to that 80, 20 split, uh, between homeowner renter, which really 50, 50, uh, in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4211.571s">Um,</a> I, <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4217.387s">can't</a> think of a way, like if there are any ideas for reaching out to renters more.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4290.528s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4303.823s">I</a> think we should have a rental registry.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4325.288s">Honestly,</a> if you go to South Medford and you knock on a door, there's a pretty good chance that some of the folks living there are renters. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4334.223s">Part</a> of the thing with handing it to the Medford Housing Authority is they <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4341.885s">A</a> lot of the public housing that they're in charge of does represent a lot of renters, but I feel like a lot of, like a huge number of renters are also just people who are like renting from private landlords. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4351.468s">And</a> there's not a way, there's just not a good way I can think of to, you know, systematically reach out to that, to that demographic.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4365.903s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4366.743s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4367.083s">And,</a> you know, I, I do remember when the charter study committee, they, they put, they actually did put a lot of effort into trying to bump up the survey numbers, but they're, they still were not able to like kind of get rid of that skew between. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4380.746s">So</a> yeah, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4382.746s">It's</a> just an inherent problem with polling in, in the city, I suppose.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4406.595s">I</a> think I read somewhere, well, I heard one time that it would cost like $7,000 to do a professional poll.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4453.759s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4459.101s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4459.381s">So</a> in terms of specific action items, <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4463.633s">either</a> myself or Councilor Tseng is going to work with Councilor Callahan on a co-sponsorship. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4468.956s">We</a> are going to design or draft an additional survey which will contain some very high level overview of the nature of the budget and how it was allocated in previous years. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4489.93s">and</a> then do a lot of what Councilor Tseng did with the previous survey only take a lot more detailed demographics data as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4497.396s">Is</a> that about a summary of?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4561.977s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4562.597s">And,</a> uh, could that, could the request for feedback go to the whole council as well?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4568.941s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4596.584s">Do</a> we have a second?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4599.167s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4601.554s">on</a> the motion by Councilor Tseng.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4658.091s">In</a> terms of timeline, if you did figure out that we needed to do it, we needed to have everything in sooner, <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4666.096s">what</a> would really be the option in terms of approval? <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4670.3s">So</a> would we potentially have to do another RSP meeting in the middle of the month next month?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4731.332s">So</a> you think just another committee meeting in two weeks, I mean, would make sense.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4823.453s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4825.114s">So</a> do you want to amend your motion to request the council president that we schedule a meeting two weeks from now?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4854.269s">Wait,</a> so.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4860.313s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4860.753s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4860.994s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4861.374s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4875.707s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4876.168s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4876.789s">Sounds</a> good.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4922.955s">So</a> do you want to just do a roll call on the motion?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4940.375s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4941.335s">We're</a> in the affirmative. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4942.336s">One</a> absent, the motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4948.359s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4950.92s">Now</a> I'm not seeing, I don't think anybody is here from the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4955.683s">Do</a> we have any other points of discussion we want on this, we have on this particular item, or do you think we're good to go?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4974.504s">Sounds</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4976.145s">Do</a> we have any other motions on the floor?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=4979.967s">Councilor,</a> or sorry, Clerk, please call the roll when you're ready.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=5006.858s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=5007.619s">For</a> an affirmative, one absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/zmO5WffK7aY&t=5009.822s">The</a> meeting is adjourned.<h2><a href="../2025-03-26_N657gyXQa48/2025-03-26_N657gyXQa48.html">City Council Planning and Permitting Committee 03-26-25</a></h2>

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=1893.871s">Feel</a> free to finish, but once you're done with the slide, I just had something I wanted to say.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=1991.724s">No,</a> so the first one was, I was just, was looking at the plot, the mixed use to be directly to the right of city hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2004.969s">I</a> was just wondering if that could, if there would be any logic <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2009.74s">And</a> updating that to mixed use three, because kind of thinking that, like, higher buildings there could act as a sound barrier to some of the traffic on on ninety three. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2025.091s">So,</a> yeah, I was just I was just like, what I was just wondering, first off, if you think that that could possibly be an idea that would work or what you're. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2037.673s">what</a> your thoughts would be on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2044.738s">I</a> also had questions relating to whether or not there could, this could just be a discussion point for later, but whether it would be possible to change the traffic patterns in <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2065.617s">or</a> if the traffic patterns in Medford Square ever were changed, which I think could be something that, you know, we might see like 30 years in the future or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2076.407s">But</a> basically, I just don't like the traffic patterns that we see in Medford Square at the moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2081.332s">And</a> I'm wondering if the zoning changes could affect that, could affect that at all.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2165.28s">Yeah,</a> sorry, that was phrased terribly. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2168.302s">I'm</a> going to basically. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2171.72s">I</a> think that the traffic patterns in Medford square terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2174.784s">I</a> would like at some point in the future to explore changing those traffic patterns. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2181.172s">It's</a> not up to it's that's not under the purview of zoning at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2185.097s">Um,</a> but I'm wondering if the, if the current zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2191.014s">Or</a> if anybody from planning can generally comment on that, like, if we were to have, like, some change in the traffic pattern to Medford square with the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2199.125s">Like,</a> how would that interact with zoning? <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2200.707s">Like,</a> would it would like it make would. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2204.9s">Increased</a> height there make it more difficult to change that in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2208.183s">Uh,</a> would it be. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2212.267s">Would</a> it be necessary to change the traffic patterns if we're finding like, more cars coming through just just like some somebody that knows more than me talking about traffic patterns, I think would be would be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2223.597s">Um,</a> particularly like the high and main street intersection. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2228.421s">So.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2637.816s">Well,</a> yeah, I mean, just on the, just on the, the concept of the view from the houses, just to the, uh, uh, just to the right of that, it, it doesn't really provide those houses don't really get much review anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2652.119s">Cause</a> I mean, I lived there, we're mostly looking at the highway. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2654.819s">So</a> I just, just kind of put that thought out there that I don't think that that, uh, I don't think any mentioned those houses at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2662.601s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2665.036s">But</a> would it also be possible to, like, I only see that part of that is, is it possible to just take maybe the south part of that parcel and make it into MX3? <a href="https://youtu.be/N657gyXQa48&t=2680.082s">Because</a> one part does seem kind of narrow, but the other part seems a little bit more beefy.<h2><a href="../2025-03-25_rbGibzmLVpU/2025-03-25_rbGibzmLVpU.html">City Council 03-25-25</a></h2>

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4617.253s">Well,</a> if there's no other folks from the public looking to speak, I'd just like to add that supporting the full-time lecturers and Tufts is particularly important because I <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4634.307s">I</a> spent most of my life in academia, last five years in a postdoc. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4640.574s">It's</a> a system that really relies on under-compensated labor from folks who have <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4656.392s">a</a> lot of training. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4661.013s">It's</a> the full-time lecturers, the junior academics that run large institutions like Tufts, and it's really the passion for what they do that ends up being exploited by the academic system that keeps these institutions and most of higher education in the country running. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4684.286s">We're</a> going through a time right now where the academic system in the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4690.93s">is</a> being particularly strained by the federal government, so it's incredibly important to show these full-time lecturers our full support because it's going to be very important for <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4705.738s">uh,</a> institutions like Tufts to offer more local support, uh, to, uh, to the junior academics that are in their institution. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=4717.329s">So</a> I have my, this resolution has my full support and I'd like to thank all the folks, um, in the chambers tonight for coming out to speak.

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6460.634s">I</a> mean, I'm, I do agree that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6469.946s">we</a> should be using free cash for some of these one-time expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6475.427s">On</a> the other hand, this is, I mean, this is an official communication from the Affordable Housing Trust where they're telling us that these parcels are individually undersized and they're saying they're not able to be developed. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6494.71s">And</a> I am disappointed <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6499.578s">and</a> my colleagues for not supporting, indicating that they wouldn't support the recommendation of the Affordable Housing Trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6511.067s">I'm</a> also disappointed in some of my colleagues for stepping off prior to this discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6517.052s">I</a> would really like to see this <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6522.222s">Uh,</a> this nexus study, uh, this nexus study actually funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6526.705s">It</a> was. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6528.566s">In</a> some of the budget recommendations that we put forward, and I would like to see this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6535.31s">Uh,</a> get in the pattern of supporting. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6539.902s">the</a> Affordable Housing Trust when it gives us a recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6545.023s">I</a> mean, if they're going to tell us that they can't use two parcels of land and so we should have a bit more of a longer term view when it comes to selling them off so that we can actually fund the nexus study, then I'm inclined to support them. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6565.229s">So</a> that's all I have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=6567.77s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7207.113s">I</a> mean, I'm on the, I'm on the community land trust, which actually is looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7212.758s">I</a> mean, it's, it's, it's still pretty early stages. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7216.141s">We're</a> working with some, with some consultants on forming a community land trust for the city and the McCormick Avenue parcels aren't even on the list of city owned land that we would be looking at to build up any sort of, <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7233.505s">Any</a> any sort of affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7235.866s">So</a> there are parcels of land that the city owns that we would be seriously looking into for that purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7245.169s">But</a> again, these are, I mean, these are too small. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7249.76s">For</a> for that purpose, um, and this clearly has been deliberated specifically at the. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7256.582s">Uh,</a> within the affordable housing trust, and we received an official communication recommending that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7263.784s">Uh,</a> they'd be sold off for this purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7266.705s">Um,</a> so I would 2nd, the motion to table that, um, I. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7275.451s">I</a> think that Vice President Collins did seem to be having some internet connectivity issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7281.352s">So</a> this could potentially be taken up at a later time. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7286.614s">But</a> given that, I would also like to hear what Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7291.975s">McGor</a> thinks, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7293.475s">McGor</a> has to say as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7294.956s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7306.406s">never</a> mind then. <a href="https://youtu.be/rbGibzmLVpU&t=7307.607s">Sorry,</a> I thought he made a motion to table.

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=716.8s">Thank</a> you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=719.442s">I</a> have the, I believe the shortest submitted recommendation of anybody here. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=725.727s">And</a> my recommendation is also reflected in that of several other Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=730.77s">It's</a> just to allocate funding for a therapeutic recreation specialist and a office manager for Medford Recreation Department, which follows several meetings that this <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=746.742s">body</a> had on the topic, the likely impact of that would be $125,000 a year, although that would likely be determined by the mayor and Kevin Bailey. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=764.452s">I</a> think the only other <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=767.073s">thing</a> that the only other priority that I had that was particularly on my mind, but I'm not sure if this would be a budget request per se, so it wasn't included, was ensuring that enough capital earmarks are available to create either a nexus study for the new affordable housing <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=789.291s">linkage</a> program or about $150,000 for a study to overhaul the entirety of the capital improvements program. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=801.538s">So</a> all of the linkage buckets that the city has. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=806.741s">Again,</a> I'm not sure if that would be a budget request or if a free cash earmark would go under that, but that's what I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=817.348s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3418.581s">Yes,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3420.282s">I</a> didn't catch it the second time. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3422.403s">Were</a> anything related to the studies for the capital improvements project or the nexus study in the six items?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3490.002s">So</a> it's, sorry, if I may, it's a little bit complicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3498.447s">So</a> the McCormick Avenue parcels, my understanding of that, and I'd have to go back through my email to check on the status of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3508.392s">I</a> didn't check it fully today. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3512.145s">But</a> the McCormick Avenue one, my understanding is that that would fund the one for the affordable housing bucket. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3520.383s">only,</a> and that would probably be around like $80,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3525.464s">But</a> in order to update all of the linkage buckets, the four that we have, as well as the new affordable housing trust, one that would cost around $150,000, which would have to come from free cash, and that wouldn't be under the DPW, that would probably be that would <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3548.917s">Yeah,</a> probably be under planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3551.118s">Um,</a> I'm also again, not sure if this would be like a line item on the budget because this would be a 1 time thing, but I. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3560.222s">would</a> personally like to see it included on this list. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3563.603s">One,</a> just because it prioritizes that in the mayor's eyes. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3571.186s">And</a> two, because this is something where it's definitely an investment. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3575.788s">I</a> mean, that's $150,000 that once it's <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3580.97s">like</a> once the studies are done and linkage fees are updated, that would end up bringing in a lot more money every year from developers, especially once the zoning is all done with, and they just have a lot more, there's like, they have a lot more options for building. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3600.161s">So</a> I do think it's important to get that done.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3644.274s">Um,</a> and I could, you know, I could talk with you a bit about this, but TDM is something that is <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3654.412s">something</a> that probably would have to be its own study at a certain point. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3659.096s">I'm</a> really just trying to, you know, push for that as hard as I can during, like, just to be included in the ordinances during the planning, during the planning and permitting committee processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3671.025s">So,</a> you know, just to kind of, just to kind of <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3675.348s">prioritize</a> some things. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3676.589s">I'm</a> really only pushing for those at this point, but I do want to see what comes up with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3681.171s">But</a> my understanding is that TDMs previously have been like their own transportation specific studies in other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3689.036s">And</a> the way it was explained to me by the planning department was that they <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3697.824s">are</a> really trying, they're really trying to prioritize just the affordable housing nexus study just to get that revenue stream in. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3705.171s">And</a> they know that it's only an $80,000 study in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3712.939s">They</a> know that it's only an $80,000 study. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3717.223s">So,</a> you know, they're kind of making that lower ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3721.395s">But</a> in order to update all of the linkage buckets, including the HT, they said that that would require a different sort of study, which would cost probably around $150,000, and they probably wouldn't like use that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3740.235s">money</a> immediately because there are some complications with updating the other linkage buckets. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3746.941s">But</a> at this point, I am comfortable just making that ask so that if later in the year, you know, they do think it's beneficial to try to conduct a study to update all the linkage buckets, then they would <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3760.673s">they</a> would be able to. <a href="https://youtu.be/DtNTjLLICLg&t=3761.813s">So</a> it is a little bit complicated, but I would, at the very least, like to emphasize the importance of just getting all of those linkage fees updated as soon as possible once the zoning is done.

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=1577.451s">So</a> I understand that there are some issues with uploading the agenda to the portal, and that's being resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=1587.94s">But</a> we did get the current agenda circulated on March 10th, but I'm noticing, Councilors did, not the public, unfortunately, but I'm noticing that <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=1599.662s">The</a> copy that Inez is showing has the explanations of what mixed use 1, 2, and 3 are, so I'd appreciate it if you could circulate the presentation to us, although that could just be a more updated copy. <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=1616.854s">But</a> yeah, going back to that, could you, I did screenshot it, but could you zoom out and just show the explanations of mixed use 1, 2, and 3? <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=1633.99s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=1635.11s">Um,</a> so, so yeah, it makes, so it makes use three to be, to be clear that could be up to 12 stories with the right incentives. <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=1645.634s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=1647.735s">Um,</a> and sorry, can you just, can you just show that, show the whole thing, the whole whole page? <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=1653.397s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=1665.699s">Yeah,</a> I would generally agree with the idea that West Medford and Medford Square do need to be more densified. <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=1674.666s">I</a> don't think that's actually a word, but yes, densified, you get what I mean. <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=1682.333s">So</a> maybe upping that to mixed use two or even three. <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=1687.337s">Out</a> of curiosity, what was the original <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=1692.72s">idea</a> behind putting the very center of Medford Square at mixed-use 1, but the surrounding areas at 2 and 3, what was the, out of curiosity, what was kind of like the thinking behind that?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=1793.362s">Yeah,</a> what would the nature of that study be? <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=1797.208s">Sorry,</a> what kind of study would you would you need to undertake to figure out if you can build higher there?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=1842.808s">Is</a> that the same situation with West Medford?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=1881.547s">Okay,</a> yeah, I'd appreciate to see the results of those studies. <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=1887.133s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3971.095s">So</a> a decision that we can make, and this is, sorry, there was a lot of text on those slides, and I'm also just trying to remember from the last time this was discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3981.58s">But</a> one discussion that we can have is whether or not to allow ADUs by right in districts that do not have single family homes, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=3996.347s">Yeah,</a> I would personally favor <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4000.11s">having</a> ADUs by right in those districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4004.611s">That's</a> just me personally, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4010.433s">And</a> it's not a thing to allow a second ADU by right. <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4014.655s">You</a> always have to go through the special permitting process, which would be the CDB, the CD board here, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4020.316s">Does</a> it have to be the CD board? <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4024.138s">Or</a> could it be some other body?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4075.275s">Yeah,</a> it should not be the city council like this should I would vote against this.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4081.522s">Yep.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4185.082s">So</a> CD board. <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4189.63s">Sounds</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4190.09s">Great.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4195.471s">Yeah,</a> the other thing, and this is, I don't know if this was part of anything, but I do remember from the conversations over a year ago that there was some requirement that an ADU couldn't be more than some percentage of the overall property. <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4212.074s">Is</a> that still in state law? <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4213.754s">It</a> couldn't be bigger than the square footage of, like, 50% of the square footage of the property? <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4219.907s">Like</a> I think that was in the old state law and I'm not sure if that continued over.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4251.681s">OK,</a> so that's still in state law, then?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4260.318s">Wait,</a> wait, sorry.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4273.661s">OK,</a> so.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4276.282s">OK,</a> so we can we can choose to make <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4279.114s">ADUs</a> larger than with the stay law.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4282.235s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4282.895s">Got</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4283.435s">Yeah,</a> because there's this weird issue that some people run into where you can have a basement ADU if it's a two-story place, but you can't have a basement ADU if it's a one-story house. <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4298.259s">I</a> think there are things like that where people were getting into, if I recall. <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4302.46s">So</a> just anything to avoid cases like that would be good. <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4310.27s">Anyway,</a> yeah, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=4314.693s">So</a> sorry, in summary, would like it if we could allow ADUs by right in districts that only have multifamily housing or no single family housing.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5521.561s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5522.882s">What's</a> progress been like on, or what do you think the ability would be to enforce any short-term rental bans in ADUs? <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5535.451s">And</a> do you think that, because I have heard it's been kind of difficult <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5539.995s">past,</a> so practically speaking.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5648.172s">So</a> following up, would any ordinances that could potentially help the city with enforcement be outside the scope of zoning? <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5660.362s">Like</a> if we wanted to implement some kind of a fine structure like what you just said, would that have to be kind of its own separate thing?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5705.593s">No,</a> I'm just kind of thinking, because a lot of people can just sort of shirk or ignore the laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5713.038s">And</a> then once it gets enforced, then maybe after they've already had a short-term rental operating for like five years, they've still made a pretty hefty profit off of doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5724.605s">So</a> what I'm thinking is, is there any possible way to say, to like, <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5730.539s">bring</a> down the hammer in cases where people do that to disincentivize the behavior. <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5734.46s">So</a> like, well, you've been renting this out for a year, so we're able to levy a larger fine against you because we can see that this has been on Airbnb this whole time. <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5743.523s">You</a> must have made this amount of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=5745.543s">I'm</a> just trying to think of ways to.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6154.181s">I</a> just wanted to briefly mention that even with the previous work on short-term rentals, I still would be interested to see if there were <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6165.575s">If</a> there are any possible mechanisms that other communities have included in their zoning towards enforcement, we're just giving the ability of the building commissioner to better enforce that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6181.424s">So</a> I would still be interested in seeing some of that work. <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6184.826s">But</a> otherwise, I did want to hear about the review of upcoming zoning project topics until June.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6204.902s">Well,</a> it's on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=6207.623s">Great.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=7020.38s">This</a> question, would some of these topics can end up sort of blend, some of the citywide topics can sort of end up blending in with each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=7029.345s">Would</a> TDM and the parking requirements that kind of like, I feel like those are <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=7037.503s">kind</a> of end up being related. <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=7041.005s">So</a> would it be... I'd just like to plant the staff and consultants' opinion on potentially merging the two of those, or if they think it would be best to keep them as separate topics.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=7101.293s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=7103.594s">I'd</a> also just like some, I'd also just like information about when one of the internal planning meetings about TDM is going to take place, whenever those are scheduled out in the next month or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/KLG8r-52Wzg&t=7117.843s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-12_llQSZsu-6bs/2025-03-12_llQSZsu-6bs.html">City Council 03-11-25</a></h2>
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=403.4s">Thank</a> you at the President services and public engagement committee, we talked about current one second got quieter. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=415.854s">But</a> we discussed the current draft of the Human Rights Commission updated ordinance and ended up deciding to continue that on to the next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=430.502s">I'd</a> like to thank my colleague, Councilor Tseng for his work on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=434.364s">We</a> then discussed some of the recent listening sessions that Councilors have been holding at the Medford Senior Center, as well as just comparing notes on them and coming up with ways to improve these. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=449.611s">And</a> we worked on the February Medford City Council newsletter, which can now be found on the Medford City Council webpage if you're interested in reading it. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=462.817s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=2500.622s">I</a> just like to thank my colleagues for doing this as well as the staff consultants who put so much work into this and especially the residents who are pushing for any kind of new zoning to happen in the area for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=2516.862s">This</a> really does present the culmination of a lot of effort in this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=2522.526s">This</a> is a response to the constant calls that we get about making businesses better in Medford, about welcoming in new businesses, about building up more affordable housing in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=2541.681s">And</a> I'm just, I'm <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=2545.016s">very</a> proud of my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=2545.996s">I'm</a> very proud of everybody who came together to make this happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=2549.817s">I'm</a> really excited about the overwhelming wave of support that we've seen in our inboxes and in the community, particularly in the in the last week about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=2568.5s">This</a> body has been talking about fixing the <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=2572.904s">many</a> issues that Medford has with our budget with with the affordable housing situation for a very long period of time and zoning is probably the most powerful lever that a local council can do to to change that. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=2588.912s">And</a> this is the first time really in a <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=2594.095s">generation</a> or two that we've seen this body act to make some change happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=2599.442s">I</a> understand that change is not something that everybody is necessarily <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=2608.899s">that</a> everybody necessarily likes. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=2610.22s">It's</a> not always something that everybody can agree upon, but I think that the community does agree that doing nothing has been the answer for a very long period of time, and it simply hasn't worked. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=2622.724s">So,</a> once again, I'd like to thank everybody for all the years of effort and advocacy put into this, as well as all of the work that was done. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=2631.448s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13612.673s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13615.854s">Phrase</a> that I've been thinking about a lot throughout the zoning process is think globally, act locally. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13624.771s">Throughout</a> this process, the consultants, the elected officials, city staff have had public meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13634.214s">They</a> have taken feedback from residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13637.795s">And</a> when they can't implement that feedback, we've offered fact-based explanations repeatedly of why we may or may not be able to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13650.532s">This</a> entire process was done not only with years worth of feedback from the entire community that was painstakingly collected, this is only the execution phase right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13661.598s">It</a> was <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13671.67s">point</a> that I'm getting at is that if I did honestly believe that addressing some of the concerns that were brought up tonight, some of the changing concerns that have continued to hear over the past couple of months, then <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13690.046s">And</a> I believe that that would get more folks on the side of rezoning, then I would then I would support that. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13696.593s">But</a> I think that if a traffic study were done it would be something else. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13700.436s">And</a> at the end of the day, you know, a lot of folks are just uncomfortable with, with the idea of change, and <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13705.781s">Anytime</a> you have any sort of rezoning process that happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13709.946s">This</a> is not just a Medford thing, you can see that neighboring communities, you can see that anywhere you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13715.471s">And</a> what's interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13717.073s">What's</a> what's always will strange to me is that anytime. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13722.717s">residents</a> talk, they speak about what they don't like about a neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13726.358s">They</a> speak about, you know, things that they oppose, but it's rarely ever, what do I want to see happen instead? <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13732.52s">It's</a> rarely ever an alternative solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13737.401s">And,</a> you know, we're not going to solve any of the problems, any of the many challenges that Medford faces by doing nothing, by more delays. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13748.023s">This</a> has been delayed for decades already. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13751.067s">All</a> right, and that's something that people really need to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13754.749s">This</a> council is the first one that is really trying to do something for the benefit of the city instead of just offering rhetoric. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13764.894s">So,</a> frankly, I think that throughout this process, as was echoed by a lot of folks in the public comment process, we already did quite a bit to water down this proposal from what it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13777.221s">Frankly,</a> I think that if we did, <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13780.183s">the</a> feasibility studies that many people have been asking, the engineers would say that we could build like 10 stories on Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13785.688s">All</a> right, so it's already a fairly modest proposal, all things considered as is. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=13792.994s">So</a> all that being said, because I do think it has been watered down, I'm gonna motion to revert the intersection between Salem and Park Street from MX1 back to MX2.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15060.454s">Sorry,</a> just to clarify, would voting yes would be voting yes for the Community Development Board's amendment? <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15068.26s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=15069.12s">Or</a> would voting yes be supporting moving Park Street and Salem back from MX 1 to 2?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18258.447s">It's</a> just a bit of housekeeping. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18260.589s">I</a> think it's something we discussed in a <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18263.133s">governance</a> committee meeting and then sort of forgot about in section 8-4 ineligible measures number 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18272.641s">It</a> still says a change in the title of a city agency or multiple member body. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18277.985s">I'd</a> like to motion first to change that to a change in the title of a city agency or any body, department, division, office, or school of the Metro Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18291.818s">just</a> because City agency does City agency does include multiple member bodies. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18296.98s">So</a> that's that's redundant, but it I don't believe I don't believe it includes the public school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18305.724s">Yeah,</a> yeah, I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18306.625s">I</a> can email that. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18307.945s">Additionally,</a> I just had also tack on to that just a motion to alphabetize the definition section because with the change to new initiative measure that now D alphabetizes the <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18320.289s">the</a> definitions, and it's just kind of annoying me. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18324.872s">So</a> we should fix that. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=18326.513s">They</a> need to be alphabetized.<h2><a href="../2025-03-06_T5xuIZg2Iek/2025-03-06_T5xuIZg2Iek.html">City Council Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee 03-05-25</a></h2>

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=770.26s">So</a> clearly everybody's here to watch the adventurous process of editing a newsletter. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=776.432s">I</a> think that's why we're all here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=986.926s">Councilor</a> Tseng just let us know when you're ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=991.288s">Good.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=993.59s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=995.611s">Welcome</a> to a meeting of the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee meeting being held today solely on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=1006.178s">We</a> have, Mr. Clerk, I keep forgetting, for Zoom only meetings, there's a roll call necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=1016.277s">Zoom</a> only committee meetings.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=1019.599s">Please</a> call the roll when you're ready.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=1037.953s">Unmute.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=1043.972s">think</a> you might need to make Councilor Lazzaro a co-host. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=1048.035s">She</a> needs to be made a co-host.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=1066.691s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=1068.91s">Present,</a> four present, one absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=1071.811s">The</a> meeting is called to order. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=1073.851s">We</a> have three items on the agenda today. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=1079.413s">A</a> resolution to discuss a modernization of the Human Rights Commission's enabling ordinance, which we'll do first. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=1085.814s">It</a> will be followed by a resolution to discuss council listening sessions in which we'll <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=1093.556s">offer</a> updates, reports of some of the recent listening sessions, particularly at the Senior Center, and then we'll work on publishing the newsletter. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=1104.502s">So</a> we'll start with the Human Rights Commission's enabling ordinance, and I'll hand it off to Councilor Tseng.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=1323.881s">Seeing</a> none, oh, yep. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=1325.342s">That's</a> my job too. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=1327.184s">Sorry,</a> I just. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=1328.505s">Yeah,</a> are there any comments from councillors? <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=1334.369s">Councilor</a> Lazzaro.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=1361.081s">Any</a> other councillors? <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=1365.484s">I</a> just like to thank Councilor Tseng as well as our wonderful community advocates for working on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=1372.251s">Feel</a> free to go over the edits as you please, Councilor.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2034.723s">Uh,</a> one, uh, could he, could he go, could you, uh, present your screen again?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2043.826s">It</a> didn't say human rights problem issues.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2475.176s">Okay,</a> so your hand is still raised.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2481.519s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2486.021s">I</a> saw that. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2488.006s">Barry's</a> hand was raised to add a comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2493.307s">So</a> we'll move on to public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2495.828s">Barry,</a> you've put your hand up and down once or twice. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2500.649s">Do</a> you still want to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2502.91s">All</a> right, I've asked you done.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2574.483s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2579.285s">Go</a> back to the thing about the legal counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2586.227s">So</a> could you expand on <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2595.137s">Did</a> the mayor, when you talked to her, provide any justification on the usual interpretation of that kind of language? <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2602.045s">Because</a> I know that when lawyers suggest language, it's often the case that it's been used elsewhere in other contexts. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2611.575s">So</a> does this imply that in certain cases, <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2617.178s">HRC</a> can retain its own legal counsel or what was kind of your or does it does it imply that if there's a city solicitor that's readily available, then they wouldn't be allowed to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2628.55s">Can</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2630.948s">Did</a> those conversations offer any additional context around this writing?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2710.777s">Councilor</a> Cotland?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2734.377s">Is</a> there any other members of the public who would like to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2745.768s">just</a> if you would feel free to raise your hand on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2757.577s">Great,</a> we will, David Harris, I'm gonna ask you to unmute.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2951.951s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2953.491s">Munir</a> Jermanes is next. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=2955.912s">I'm</a> going to ask you to unmute.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=3172.374s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=3172.914s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=3174.711s">I'm</a> also not sure if I was, I don't think I was asking folks to name an address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=3179.214s">Oh,</a> I'm sorry.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=3186.099s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=3188.801s">And</a> Adam, did you get, did you get it for David?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=3198.598s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=3203.9s">Gotcha.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=3204.22s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=3205.641s">Uh,</a> very Ingber next can ask you to unmute name and address for the record, please.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=3406.773s">you,</a> Barry. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=3408.715s">Jennifer</a> Yanko. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=3409.957s">I'm</a> going to ask you to unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=3411.218s">Name</a> and address for the record, please.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=3555.892s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=3559.713s">Do</a> we have any other members of the public who would like to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=3569.595s">Steve</a> Schnapp can ask you to unmute, name and address for the record, please.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=3680.502s">So</a> with the, I mean, I think this is what we, <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=3684.751s">Well,</a> this is what I asked about with that particular language that was written there, is that it doesn't really seem clear to me one way or the other, and that could be the intent whether or not the HRC would have access to independent legal counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=3706.699s">And</a> it looked like the original language specified that in the case that there wasn't a city solicitor, <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=3714.492s">I</a> think that must have been one draft of it that I saw in the edits, that they would get access to their own legal counsel, though that still doesn't quite account for the case where you have a city solicitor and you might want to have your own even with that person present. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=3733.446s">So</a> I suppose I'm just wondering if there's any <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=3740.423s">that</a> you would have preferred the one that's currently in there, or do you think it should explicitly say so? <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=3747.848s">David</a> Harris?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=3975.888s">Councilor</a> Tseng, do you, did this come up in your conversations with, on the city side?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4042.475s">David,</a> Harris asked you to unmute.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4168.592s">I</a> mean, I can personally see it flying both ways because on <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4176.782s">Like</a> you could have one party insisting that that means only the city's legal counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4188.344s">You</a> could have another party insisting that it, it would really just depend on what you're reading is, is it, what you're reading of it is at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4202.989s">But</a> I also do agree that there's not really a need to belabor the point presently. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4215.518s">Jennifer.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4277.621s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4280.262s">And</a> Vanier?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4314.289s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4316.672s">Are</a> there any other anything, anything else that Councilors would like to say, I'm, I'm just trying to think through this, just to.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4448.871s">I'm</a> going to go to Barry and then yeah.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4496.597s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4498.558s">So</a> Councilor Tseng did you say that you wanted to get this done. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4503.983s">Next</a> month, or what was your what was your plan in terms of wanting to refer it to regular meeting.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4633.562s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4637.309s">I'm</a> in favor of striking it, but David Harris.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4672.523s">Okay,</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4674.984s">Good</a> point. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4676.665s">Any</a> other comments from councillors? <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4680.206s">Well,</a> I mean, it does sound like there is consensus. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4685.37s">on</a> the vast majority of this document, although I do think that there are some potential issues with that sentence. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4694.192s">They're</a> definitely not as many as the length of time we've spent discussing it would imply. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4699.833s">So</a> we did definitely belabor the point, but I do think that these are relatively minor issues at the end of the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4708.254s">With</a> that, do we have any motions on the floor?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4724.269s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4752.745s">Um,</a> I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4758.868s">Personally,</a> and Anna or Emily, feel free to raise your hand and jump in with your own suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4767.01s">OK,</a> Emily, yeah, you speak first.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4787.593s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4788.714s">Anna.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4839.213s">I</a> personally, I personally think that presenting this current language is fine, but I would like to. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4845.978s">Float</a> some of the suggestions that were presented by by members in this meeting to her to just see what. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4856.243s">to</a> see what you think about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4857.704s">I</a> do under, yep.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4877.276s">Well,</a> Anna. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4882.951s">Your</a> hands, sorry, it's your hands raised.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4886.935s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4889.398s">I</a> feel like that goes into like what they're talking about, what we're talking about before, like potentially like putting in loopholes. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4894.643s">I'll</a> just get the mayor to say no. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4896.205s">So</a> I would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4897.266s">I</a> think I think it's it's. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4901.649s">It's</a> a good idea and there were suggestions to like more strongly imply it But I would I would just kind of try to float by her like some of the different suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4912.714s">I</a> would personally personally I would be more comfortable With a little bit more clarity here, but I'm also concerned about just the potential for saying no and like more delays and <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=4926.312s">And</a> so on.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5002.605s">Oh,</a> Matt, you're up.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5004.201s">Could</a> it be phrased a little bit more cleanly, like in the form of reports that are at least annual, like at minimum annual? <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5015.044s">It's</a> not a big deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5018.266s">I'm</a> just... Okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5027.568s">Never</a> mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5028.089s">That's</a> fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5028.909s">I'm</a> being pedantic at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5030.889s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5033.994s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5035.614s">Anyway,</a> is there anything else that you want to go over in this?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5048.817s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5050.438s">Do</a> we have a second on the motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5054.639s">Second</a> by Councilor Lazzaro.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5063.27s">It's</a> a motion to accept the edits and receive in place on file.

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5174.073s">Okay,</a> I just included this item on the agenda because there were previous initiatives to, there were previous requests to actually report back a few things that we heard about from some of the listening sessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5192.65s">We've</a> had two listening sessions at the Senior Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5197.232s">I've</a> attended both of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5198.293s">I</a> was accompanied by Councilor Lazzaro the first time, and most recent one by Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5205.697s">Just</a> for a very brief report, they went, I think, I personally think they went well. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5211.76s">There,</a> I mean, of course, there's a little bit of contention, like they're <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5215.763s">like</a> there often is at these things, but a lot of it was just like residents just voicing concerns, particularly with the roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5225.375s">I</a> think probably half of what we heard about was potholes in the city and parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5232.044s">There</a> are general concerns about <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5234.938s">the</a> pop-up park and the RFPs at the planning department. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5240.582s">Concerns</a> that that would remove parking spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5243.384s">I</a> think that in both of the listening sessions, we were trying to clarify that the planning office didn't intend to remove any sort of parking, but intended to accept a proposal that would turn it into ground floor parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5264.011s">then</a> a lot of discussions about the override and discussions about the override and affordability as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5276.842s">And</a> then another thing that happened was, you know, I think that, you know, a couple of residents were just like kind of being, were kind of like, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5291.335s">taking</a> up a lot of the sort of hour that we were there. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5294.576s">And</a> so afterwards, and this especially happened the most recent one, a lot of residents approached us individually and just asked Councilor Callaghan and I about sort of their own pet issues that they were concerned about, but they didn't really feel like asking in front of an audience. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5312.681s">Like</a> one fellow approached me and he asked if he could roll an auto pay in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5316.722s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5320.036s">Yeah,</a> so so those were that's kind of like my own library report of how that went. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5325.383s">I</a> do think it went well. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5326.424s">I</a> think it's good to connect with residents that don't normally have computer access quite as consistently and just be there and try to explain how things are working in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5338.582s">I</a> did email from the second session I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5340.523s">I</a> know Councilor Callahan and I, who I see your hand raised, did report back some of the concerns to the relevant departments in the city, just so they're aware of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5350.05s">So</a> yeah, no, I feel like it was a good initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5353.893s">There</a> was like 12 to 15 at each. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5355.434s">I</a> think even more at the last one. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5357.215s">So</a> yeah, Councilor Callahan, feel free to go.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5681.275s">Councilor</a> Lazzaro.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5894.137s">Councilor</a> Tseng.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=5997.642s">Councilor</a> Calhan.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6089.628s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6091.249s">My</a> answer, well, first, I think that I just have different standards at this point in terms of angry crowds. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6099.936s">So</a> that's one part of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6101.418s">But</a> no, I mean, the reason that I liked it was, I mean, you know, I saw the exact same thing that you all saw. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6107.442s">There</a> was like one person there who had gone to <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6112.166s">You</a> know all the Salem Street meetings and was constantly bringing that that the RFPs up. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6118.51s">And</a> then there was another fellow who, you know, was, I never met him before but he was talking about like, you know, potholes and stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6128.667s">The</a> reason that the reason that I liked it so much, that was one, there were people that like I'd never seen before that were asking questions, kind of like figuring other things out, even with, you know, like the one or two more angry audience members to it was in a place which is like the lunches at the senior center where the city Councilors are in a place that, you know, they aren't normally necessarily going to. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6155.844s">But</a> like they're very physically like <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6159.385s">You</a> know, they're, they're like, very physically present, like, people who don't normally know how to seek us out online can just kind of, like, wander in there and kind of see what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6167.496s">And</a> so that that's why I liked it. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6169.699s">I</a> think the other listening sessions, I think, were great, but it was, it was an organizational problem, kind of like, trying to. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6176.439s">coordinate</a> with community liaisons and gather everybody up for these sort of one time things. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6181.523s">And</a> I think like showing up to the senior center provides like a regular thing where people figure out that it's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6188.549s">And,</a> you know, you know, I think that there there were some like it was a bit of a you know, the first ones were like, you know, a little bit bumpy, but I thought there were <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6198.214s">they're</a> overall productive. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6199.334s">And</a> I think this is the kind of thing where, you know, you keep going there over time and you develop relationships there and it becomes kind of known that you can go to this, like go there at this time and kind of ask your local city councilor about something so that people know like a place to physically find you. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6213.759s">And</a> so that's what I appreciated about it because it's, it's reproducible. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6218.06s">I</a> think things calm down as you kind of like develop relationships with people and you kind of <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6223.022s">transition</a> from like, somebody that somebody heard about the abstract to like a physical presence that there and you can get to know one on one. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6230.186s">And</a> that's, that's the component about it that I think that I, that I appreciated so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6238.79s">That</a> clarifies. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6239.45s">So</a> I think it's just, I also think it's good that like, we're kind of alternating and different Councilors can go on different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6245.253s">So</a> I won't be able to go to the March one. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6247.094s">But</a> I think that I just have a very different approach from the way that <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6251.121s">Councilor</a> Lazzaro or Callahan will want to do theirs individually. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6254.182s">And</a> I look forward to, you know, hearing about how those different approaches are working or like what individuals think of those different approaches. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6261.643s">That</a> way we can like kind of compare notes and see what everybody else is sort of independently doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6267.224s">Cause</a> like, I'm gonna, I'll run mine my own way, but if I hear that Councilor Callahan's is going so much better than mine, I might just start adapting practices from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6278.857s">So</a> yeah, that's my two cents. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6282.058s">I</a> think it's just kind of different views on the same event. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6286.319s">But</a> anyway, I don't see anybody in the audience. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6290.28s">So</a> to keep things running long, let's go to the newsletter. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6294.922s">Let's</a> go to the newsletter. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6296.442s">So</a> I did send everybody here a copy of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6306.852s">I</a> pre formatted everything to save myself the stress of doing of doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6313.616s">So</a> I apologize if moment if the edits are not as clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6322.36s">and</a> a Google Doc as they were before. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6326.381s">This</a> is the latest draft that I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6327.942s">Essentially</a> what I realized, two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6330.422s">First,</a> on the January, we didn't cover the January 28th regular meeting, the last one, so I included that in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6337.245s">And</a> there wasn't too much, I think the most substantive things that happened were the McCormick Avenue and the resolution to make <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6349.898s">The</a> discussion on property tax bills and the red solution to make council meetings more business friendly, which I threw in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6355.523s">I,</a> yes, I included the I included under general business the outcome of yesterday's charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6371.002s">the</a> charter draft to a regular meeting, just noting that we voted on a few technical edits as well as a change to the start of charter studies committee's proposed new council composition of eight ward-based and three at-large to four district-based and five at-large Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6387.125s">So</a> just noting the outcome of that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6388.986s">And</a> also what we, <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6395.604s">just</a> did just discuss an update to the human rights commission ordinance and just kind of threw the sentence in there because we just did that. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6404.532s">So</a> offer an update on this present meeting that we're currently in right at this moment.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6427.241s">Yep,</a> yep, yep, yep, yep.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6500.309s">Okay,</a> so I'm just coming up with specific wording which I'm doing I'll just I'll just stop sharing and reach and share the actual window that I'm that I'm looking at so you can you can see How the sausage is made Good ol latex Okay, we passed <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6523.997s">an</a> $8 million bond for the DPW to repair lit sewer pipes. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6528.259s">This</a> is to help private property owners what?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6674.186s">So</a> this is, so I think like this stuff right here, and I apologize for the lack of effectiveness, is, so this is just the stuff under the governance committee section. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6684.034s">This</a> just kind of shows like what parts we discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6687.097s">I</a> feel like that could just generally be thrown out because it's, <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6693.58s">I</a> mean, yeah, we discussed like multiple parts of the charter, but this is like kind of more substantively what we actually changed.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6719.387s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6723.355s">I</a> do feel like like reporting the actual changes that were made.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6833.827s">Anna's</a> noted that her phone battery is about to die.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6866.285s">But</a> yeah, we didn't meet on. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6868.066s">Oh,</a> oh yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6870.896s">Wait,</a> hold on, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6872.197s">Yeah,</a> because we just did the Committee of the Whole instead. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6875.418s">Oh,</a> yes, right. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6878.399s">Wait,</a> this is under general business. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6880.78s">On</a> March 4th, we loaded some draft of the, that's not under governance, but this is the other governance stuff here. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6886.623s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6888.543s">Is</a> March 4th mentioned here?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6908.381s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6908.541s">And</a> there was, I had a placekeeper there and given the lack of sleep, I left it in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6914.666s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6915.146s">No</a> worries.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6918.309s">Um,</a> yeah, I, I don't normally edit them beforehand cause it does. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6925.635s">format</a> them beforehand because it does take a lot of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6928.676s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6929.736s">And</a> this time I just wanted to get it over with. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6934.037s">Is</a> there anything else?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6980.193s">Coincidence?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=6981.093s">You</a> decide.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=7004.876s">I</a> said it. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=7006.637s">Okay,</a> I'm going to do the charters on the compensation for elected officials, additionally removed recall provisions, etc, etc. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=7016.264s">And</a> set this we
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=7031.754s">I</a> just, I feel like I cannot, there was so much context on all of this stuff.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=7077.012s">actually</a> what I was thinking was to add a disclaimer in future newsletters because there are like the print versions of this and the text versions of this so maybe like something to say like note on the on the web-based version of this we have the underlined words are links to both to YouTube videos agendas and to like live live recordings <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=7105.907s">online</a> agendas and other relevant items.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=7153.98s">Okay,</a> so this is, this is what that looks, this is what the, note that the underlying words in this newsletter indicate <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=7160.971s">Links</a> to online agendas, live recordings, and other relevant resource. <a href="https://youtu.be/T5xuIZg2Iek&t=7166.473s">Anna,</a> yeah.

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6065.265s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6068.686s">Apologies,</a> I've been sitting here silently this whole time just listening to the discourse. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6077.189s">So</a> I just did feel the need to put my own thoughts out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6084.231s">I've</a> been kind of hesitant to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6088.217s">do</a> this at previous meetings like at the Governance Committee mainly because I'm not a voting member on those and partially because I think that the more the more kind of drama that comes out of this process, I think the less likely it is that people be inclined to vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6109.953s">So</a> my <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6111.651s">A</a> lot of my conversations have taken place with, you know, I've called up individual members of the Charter Study Committee to try to get, have a conversation with them about merits, the ins and out of different issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6127.58s">And</a> I've been very grateful in instances where, you know, we could <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6133.11s">talk</a> about like the actual issues, like if I vote on a certain part of the charter, if I vote one way or the other, what will be the best outcome in practice? <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6144.239s">I</a> can't have that same conversation with everybody, but for the folks who I can have reasonable disagreements with and good conversations about the issues, I'm very grateful. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6162.382s">I</a> was a member of the Medford Charter Review Coalition back in 2022, and I was one of the early members of the Charter Study Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6172.848s">I</a> stepped down after a couple of months when I started my city council campaign. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6180.232s">But</a> the point is that seeing some form of charter review pass is very important to me personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6189.797s">And</a> I think that if you <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6191.461s">you</a> know, if you don't actually want this to pass, uh, the voters, the key, what you do is you make this as dramatic as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6198.566s">And</a> you, uh, just try to inflame tension so much that you come up with a pretense to go against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6204.611s">And</a> that's not something I want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6206.752s">I,</a> I honestly think that the five, four system or the eight, three system, um, would be an improvement over what we have now. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6217.42s">My</a> view is that I, <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6220.247s">I</a> think the more important thing than either of those systems is getting the component of the charter whereby it's reviewed once every 10 years, because that way, if we end up passing 5-4, for instance, and we find out that it doesn't work as well as folks thought or 8-3, then the charter's reviewed once every 10 years, you can come back with a recommendation and then you can end up passing something new. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6247.947s">I</a> do think it would be harder to go from 8-3 to 5-4 and cut two councillors off than it would be to expand from 9 to 11. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6259.333s">So</a> that is one part of my calculus. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6264.556s">I</a> also do actually agree that, you know, based on the conversations I've had that the <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6272.655s">8.3</a> model is the most popular among the folks I've talked with. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6279.163s">But</a> I think that's also mainly because nothing else has really been presented as an option or kind of gone out into the public discourse. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6290.358s">And</a> I've had the experience multiple times where I've had folks who I've worked with in the past, they'll send me an email saying, please go for the 8.3 system, call them up, have a conversation with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6307.827s">And</a> then I bring up some of my concerns with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6311.429s">And</a> they'll say, OK, no, I see where you're coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6315.791s">It's</a> just the fact that they, I think, <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6319.54s">At</a> the end of the day there, they were saying that they really just want to get away from the seven at large system and go with something else. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6327.645s">So</a> the issues, I've been a bit disappointed with the conversations that we've had in these chambers mainly because it's just gotten so politicized like so many other issues that it's kind of impossible to actually talk about the issues themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6344.996s">I've</a> also been, <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6346.437s">thinking</a> very strongly about, you know, the potential of offending people that I used to work with burning bridges. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6352.862s">And</a> none of those are really, none of those are really considerations of like the central question of what will actually work out best for the city moving forward, like what practically will work out. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6366.853s">With</a> the 8-3 system, I think it's the most popular, it's the most intuitive. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6372.417s">It's</a> what folks have been emailing me about. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6377.201s">My</a> concern with it has to do mainly with turnout. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6382.484s">So</a> I have an Excel spreadsheet in front of me with the 2021 municipal elections turnout. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6391.09s">There's</a> like a <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6393.668s">there's</a> like a 3.1 to one ratio between the turnout of voters in Ward three to the voters in Ward seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6403.072s">And</a> that reflects that Senate issue where like a Senator elected in California was elected with 36 million to represent 36 million voters, whereas one in Wyoming, like less than a million. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6417.798s">With</a> the district system, it's mitigated a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6422.481s">So</a> the Ward, <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6425.527s">I</a> believe the, let's see, I have my, so the ratio between the highest average turnout district and the lowest average turnout district will be like 1.9 to one. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6434.516s">So</a> there is that issue there. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6437.419s">So</a> that's mainly what I'm thinking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6439.28s">I</a> think that, <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6451.252s">There</a> are there were philosophical differences in the approach of the Charter Study Committee versus the approach that Council has in the sense that I think the Charter Study Committee was <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6464.443s">looking</a> at what is kind of like theoretically the best model, like almost from a political science perspective, like what is, so, and I think that a lot of what Councilors are thinking about is what will practically happen, like what will be the outcome in effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6483.786s">And</a> I think that's where a lot of this discrepancy is coming from between sort of the two approaches. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6490.827s">I</a> think they're both legitimate. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6495.05s">but</a> there does tend to be a little bit of, does tend to be a little bit of not seeing eye to eye there. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6501.291s">So</a> now there's a bit of a rambling speech right there, but I just wanted to, you know, I just wanted to offer my thoughts. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6508.993s">I</a> mean, this, this is an issue that, that means a lot to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6514.494s">And</a> it's something that I've thought about a lot over the past two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6519.154s">It's</a> something I thought about a lot when campaigning. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=6522.818s">So,</a> you know, just because I've been keeping my mouth shut most of the time, it doesn't mean I haven't been thinking about it a lot.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7748.733s">Yeah,</a> I mean, I did write a blog post during my campaign, which Mr. Giovino brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7760.757s">So</a> again, a lot of my silence on this <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7777.353s">Like,</a> I think most other Councilors, especially those on the governance committee have said a lot more about a lot of different issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7786.316s">And</a> I definitely said a lot of comments about Article 8, for instance, during the last governance committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7799.681s">But</a> otherwise, I've... <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7802.494s">tried</a> to stay out of this for the most part. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7806.835s">I</a> was originally the person who suggested the 5-4 model, largely because I thought that keeping it, I didn't support the 7-3, and I thought it was a good compromise between the ward-based system and what Council President Bears proposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7826.539s">So</a> the way I viewed it was as a good compromise between the two systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7832.771s">Two,</a> I think that the Chair of the Charter Study Committee just now brought up a very good point, which is that the comparison to the Senate is a little more nuanced. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7847.565s">It</a> is a bit of an extreme example, mainly because the wards are <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7856.22s">do</a> have approximately equal population, whereas Senate districts are very, very disproportionate. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7863.022s">But</a> the point about voter turnout was something that, come on, just, guys.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7881.366s">So</a> I think the point about voter turnout <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7885.663s">does</a> need to be addressed because during, I mean, during my campaign, I was very, I was convinced that voter turnout was primarily due to engagement, self-fulfilling prophecies. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7897.592s">And</a> I do, I think that that's definitely true to an extent. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7901.475s">I</a> think that is a fact that is definitely a factor. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7905.879s">Ward</a> three has higher voter turnout because they feel a lot more connected to the high numbers of Councilors that have been elected out of there. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7914.085s">And</a> that's very true. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7916.744s">And</a> Ward 7, you know, so voter turnout does turn out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7923.407s">The</a> thing is that I don't think that ward representation would actually solve the voter turnout issue, and that's because of the different institutions that are present in the different wards. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7933.992s">Ward</a> 4 has a lot of tough students who, a lot of them don't even register to vote locally. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7941.496s">Ward</a> 7 has a lot of high-rise apartment buildings that, <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7944.617s">city</a> council candidates can't actually physically access. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7948.001s">So</a> the voter turnouts for single family homes is, I think it's just inherently biased to have more people who vote in municipal elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7965.884s">One</a> thing I will say with the Charter Study Committee is that I still have good relationships with most of the people on there personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7981.158s">I</a> worked with them, I respect them, I feel like I can have a conversation with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7987.283s">And</a> when I wrote the blog post saying I would support them, <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=7991.824s">an</a> effort to put some degree of faith in their work to, you know, to raise the status of what they were doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=8002.887s">Because</a> I, you know, I did work with three of them on the Charter Review Coalition, and I knew that they just wanted to see, that they wanted to see it, some form of charter review pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=8018.13s">I've,</a> there have been a, <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=8021.803s">small</a> number of members that have said things that I wish they did not, that I wish they didn't say in public. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=8036.506s">One</a> member in particular put out a death threat against a sitting elected official and said that she hates most of council and 95% of our supporters. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=8051.673s">And</a> so when she was saying those things, and I felt like I was trying, especially in the beginning of this term, to support the work of the Charter Study Committee, I just felt like that was a betrayal of that trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=8070.282s">And</a> I just wish that had never happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=8074.965s">And</a> I think that the vast majority of the work of the people on the committee has been <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=8080.603s">very</a> admirable. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=8082.184s">But</a> yeah, once again, I think I've been talking for a bit too long here. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=8088.77s">So</a> I apologize for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=8090.151s">But</a> I've had a lot of thoughts on the way that this whole process has gone down. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=8097.938s">And</a> I have largely kept silent because I just think that more drama won't do it any favors. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=8106.705s">And</a> I do want to see this pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=8108.086s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=8995.031s">I</a> just wanted to quickly say I actually am kind of sympathetic to the timeline thing and the idea that this is a little bit rushed from City Council's perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=9010.56s">I</a> do think that the Charter Study Committee worked for a while on it, but I do wish that we had <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=9021.917s">more</a> time to flesh things out. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=9024.117s">I</a> kind of wish that we'd gotten some more progress updates or that individual articles were presented at a given time throughout the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=9038.88s">But</a> obviously, that's just not how things went down. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=9043.821s">But</a> no, I actually am sympathetic to the idea that I wish council had more time to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=9053.173s">I</a> personally would rather see a good chart that we all agree on than necessarily prioritizing the November 2025 ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=9060.381s">But</a> I do understand that more people probably want to see it come onto this ballot instead of more delays. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=9066.107s">So</a> that's just my two cents.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11157.801s">Well,</a> the signature process is an interesting thing to bring up. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11162.323s">That</a> was what the Medford Charter Review Coalition was trying to do for a very long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11167.666s">I</a> was actually looking through my email the other day to try to figure out how many signatures had been collected. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11174.249s">And</a> I think the number was about 2,600. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11177.21s">A</a> lot of them were by a former school committee member, Michael Ruggiero, who was a, <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11183.787s">like</a> a machine when it came to doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11187.41s">And</a> I believe the number that would have needed to be required to trigger a home rule petition would have been closer to 5,300. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11196.937s">And</a> especially in the COVID years, I thought it was 15% of 44,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11214.721s">Well,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11215.342s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11215.582s">I</a> mean, that's true. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11216.263s">So</a> I think, I think we're shooting for like 7,500. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11218.265s">Um,</a> but strictly speaking, like 44,100, it would be about 5,300, um, would be, uh, would be about the number that you need. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11229.395s">Um,</a> and so that was, that was the effort for, that was the effort for a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11236.361s">I</a> think that if that had succeeded, this process would look <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11239.772s">very</a> different. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11240.972s">I</a> think it would be better in some ways, although as Chair McDonald told me, we actually did have a successful petition, I think back in like the 70s or 80s, 1978, and it kind of fell apart because there were some dissenting members. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11257.115s">But</a> the point is that at some point in the charter review process, you do need some kind of an elected body. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11263.476s">And</a> under the Home Rule petition process, the nine members that comprise that themselves are elected. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11268.257s">And</a> that's why <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11270.138s">you</a> can end up getting much more unique processes, like much more unique charters that are home rule charters. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11277.524s">I</a> believe that's how, I'm not 100% sure, but I believe that's how Cambridge got ranked choice voting.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11288.533s">Okay,</a> well, that was my impression. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11291.616s">And</a> again, like I'm, <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11295.822s">I've</a> been very cognizant about that blog post and the context at the time when I wrote it, that was brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11303.871s">And</a> a lot of me, like a lot of the reason that, again, I haven't been too, too, <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11312.682s">vocal</a> about a lot of this stuff is because I do think that there were some issues with the way that the Charter Study Committee happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11324.87s">And</a> I don't think that they were actually the fault of most members of the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11327.832s">I</a> think that I don't want to... <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11332.4s">One</a> thing I think is that the charter study committee really should have been confirmed by a vote of the city council and I can understand the reason that it wasn't done at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11341.95s">I</a> think that with three members who didn't want charter review to happen like the mayor just wanted to simplify the process at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11350.258s">and</a> create a charter study committee that she just appointed. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11355.3s">But</a> I don't think that it's really done without any council involvement in pretty much any other context. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11363.262s">And</a> again, that's not the fault of the people on, that was the decision by the mayor, but I do think that this process would be going a lot more smoothly if there were integration from <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11377.307s">the</a> body that would eventually be voting on that charter much earlier in the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11381.83s">And</a> that's why in the current draft of the charter, it is written that the City Council confirms the Charter Study Committee when it's when it's re-reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11391.656s">So</a> like every every 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11393.918s">So</a> again, I <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11398.12s">I</a> do have a lot of thoughts on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11401.084s">I</a> thank the members of the Charter Study Committee that did try to address the concerns that I brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11407.232s">I</a> think that that is reflective of what an expert body should try to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11411.318s">I</a> don't think that it should be <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11415.443s">trying</a> to, you know, lobby or grandstand or, or anything like that to get their way. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11420.266s">I</a> think that if you're, if you're an expert body, you need to address the specific concerns that are being brought up by a body like this one, and have a calm conversation about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11432.792s">And</a> I do appreciate it when that happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11437.714s">Yeah,</a> anyway, I'm sorry, I've <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11439.805s">been</a> quite long winded tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11442.167s">And</a> I think that we've been talking about this for far too long. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11446.05s">I'd</a> like to thank everybody for their work on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=11450.333s">And</a> I'd like to thank all the folks on Zoom, Charter Study Committee for all of their work and everybody for listening to this very long Committee of the Whole meeting.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=13439.574s">Sorry,</a> this is a bit of a curveball point, but it's something that came up between the last governance committee meeting on Article 8 and now, and I figured we're in a committee the whole meeting about this, so I might as well bring it up, float it around as an idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=13456.458s">A</a> resident brought up the proposal to me that the free petition in section, I believe, or Article 8, Section 1, should not just be limited to registered voters, since there are also potentially non-voters.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=13488.443s">It's</a> just something that I thought seemed like a good idea when it was brought up.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=13538.47s">All</a> right.<h2><a href="../2025-02-26_oTl3eTGg6is/2025-02-26_oTl3eTGg6is.html">City Council Planning and Permitting Committee 02-26-25</a></h2>
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=682.356s">I</a> can't hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=682.876s">But</a> yes.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=1867.627s">Got</a> a bit of a cold, which is why I'm not there in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=1871.029s">And</a> I hope that the audio in the chambers doesn't make me completely beyond comprehension. <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=1883.378s">I</a> understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=1885.839s">Cool.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=1887.4s">So</a> looking through these use tables and the proposed maps, <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=1898.767s">What</a> ADUs were allowed in accessory dwelling units was a little bit unclear to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=1903.189s">Are</a> ADUs going to be discussed later? <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=1910.8s">on</a> and is there sort of like differences in where ADUs are allowed for each one of these different types of residential uses? <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=1921.322s">Sort</a> of, and is that kind of like its own separate table? <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=1926.003s">Sorry,</a> I was just like looking through, I was trying to get some clarity on the ADUs situation and I wasn't really finding it.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2097.35s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2098.812s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2099.613s">Thank</a> you very much for the for the clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2102.596s">Um.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2102.857s">I</a> was I was seeing 80 you mentioned on some of the proposed residential zoning maps, like single unit dwelling plus 80 you under. <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2115.432s">1,</a> 2, 1, 2, and 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2118.534s">And</a> it was unclear to me if ADUs, from looking at that, if ADUs were allowed on two or three unit dwellings. <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2128.642s">But</a> it sounds like those are still all on the table and will be discussed next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2133.045s">So</a> if that's going to be a topic of later discussion, I'm happy to just move on.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2155.828s">So</a> in NR1, is it only single-unit dwellings that can have ADUs? <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2160.091s">Or</a> is a two-unit dwelling allowed to have an additional ADU as well?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2200.439s">Okay,</a> all right, that clarifies it. <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2202.621s">Thank</a> you, thank you very much.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2314.356s">Yeah,</a> it does. <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2316.078s">So</a> yeah, from what they're explaining, if <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2321.358s">If</a> a single unit dwelling is allowed in a given district, then any principal unit in that district also has to be able to have an ADU by right. <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2333.086s">I</a> think that's what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2335.367s">But</a> if it's in like an urban residential, which doesn't allow single family homes, then you're not necessarily required to allow ADUs. <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2350.967s">whether</a> or not you get a second ADU would be up to the Community Development Board in any case. <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2357.512s">Is</a> that an accurate summary?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2373.785s">And</a> is it, just for one further clarification, <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2378.73s">If</a> you're allowed one ADU, like if the zoning says you're allowed one ADU, is there any place in the zoning where you can say, no, you're not allowed a second ADU, even with a special permit? <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2388.732s">Or</a> if you allow one ADU, do you have to allow for the possibility of a second ADU?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2471.24s">Is</a> the permit granting body always the Community Development Board or can it be some other body within the city?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2503.529s">Okay,</a> could that be like the staff level?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=2523.883s">Apologies</a> for the extended questioning.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=8725.46s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=8726.041s">I'm</a> going to echo the point that a lot of the fundamental points that <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=8734.622s">Council</a> President Bears was just saying, except in more fundamental terms, which is that a lot of this is about trade-offs. <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=8745.848s">You're</a> not ever going to have a situation where you have a neighborhood consisting of a bunch of beautiful single-family homes that your nephew can afford. <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=8761.504s">Unless</a> your nephew is very rich. <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=8763.805s">That's</a> not that was the Situation in an economy from a few generations ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=8769.888s">It's</a> not the case today. <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=8772.67s">So</a> you If you want to if you want to talk if you want to <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=8780.454s">talk</a> about issues with density, that's a conversation that can be had. <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=8783.896s">If</a> you want to talk about issues with affordability, that's a conversation that can be had. <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=8789.459s">But</a> if you're going to come up and talk about how you don't want density, but you also don't want your kids or grandkids to be pushed out of the community because they can't afford it, those are contradictory things because <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=8807.239s">because</a> of just basic supply and demand. <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=8809.344s">So</a> this is... <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=8813.819s">not</a> going to be a case where everybody can have everything they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=8817.921s">But</a> the reason that rezoning is happening is because enough of the community over time came together and realized that keeping things at the status quo would be a worse state of affairs than changing them. <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=8834.608s">So</a> we are trying to change them into something that would be better. <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=8840.627s">And</a> as people have been saying, not everybody is going to agree on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=8843.81s">But</a> I personally do want to do this to prioritize the affordability and supply issues that have been facing both this community and frankly, the rest of the nation for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=8862.688s">I'm</a> not sure if <a href="https://youtu.be/oTl3eTGg6is&t=8867.282s">Any</a> of my further colleagues would also want to speak further if there's any more public comment, but I'm not seeing any, so I'd just like to follow that up with a motion to adjourn.

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2470.06s">Thank</a> you, Chair Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2473.161s">I</a> understand that I'm not a voting member of this committee, so I do appreciate being given the opportunity to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2483.003s">I'd</a> also like to apologize to folks, because I'm not there in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2487.324s">I'm</a> a bit under the weather now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2490.197s">don't</a> want to infect anybody with whatever cold I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2496.365s">But</a> so I just like to say first that to Tanya's point that, and I understand Patricia was present for a few of these, but a lot of the conversations about <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2508.58s">where</a> this could be housed were had behind closed doors. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2513.481s">So</a> I think the first idea was the library, which did lead to the meeting with the folks at the library thinking that we could, like thinking we could request to have them budget for more positions there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2528.585s">Then</a> they recommended to look into Francis's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2532.266s">And</a> I believe there was some conversation between the mayor <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2541.229s">Lisa</a> Crowley, I believe, and Francis about where something about the best place something like this could be housed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2548.833s">And</a> ultimately, I did speak to Lisa about this and she did recommend and she recommended she thought that the position in Medford rec made the most sense, which Kevin Bailey did seem to. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2566.663s">did</a> did seem to concur with like just in terms of what was being talked about at the time that just kind of seemed kind of seemed like it made the most sense so a lot of the Reason for choosing that is like I'm not necessarily married to the idea of this position being in Medford rec but it was the idea that at some point you do have to make a choice and that there's going to be Different benefits and drawbacks to housing this position in any particular place <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2596.312s">So</a> if somebody does want to have those conversations with city staff again, and they come to a different conclusion that it's best housed in Francis's office, then that could be a better pressure point to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2613.496s">But</a> the conversations I had did seem to indicate that adding <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2620.378s">a</a> that adding one or two positions to Kevin's office would be sort of the most conducive to what they're trying to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2626.653s">I</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2628.818s">I</a> think that I can definitely understand where the caution of some of the parents are coming from because, you know, obviously when you've been doing advocacy for as long as y'all have and you've been burned by like, you know, previous Councilors and previous city staff and like I could understand the skepticism. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2651.467s">But</a> I do think that the asks that we have for starting this do need to be clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2658.594s">And</a> this is also something where I do defer to Councilor Scarpelli's expertise, because I mean, this is something where he is <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2670.206s">uh</a> a professional in this area like this is what he does for his day job like he does youth programming and he seems to be supportive of the idea of putting another position uh under medford rec to aid this um <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2685.652s">As</a> Councilor Collins was saying, this doesn't necessarily have to be where something like this ends. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2691.737s">So</a> it could just be imagined at the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2695.18s">And</a> when we're beginning something, we're not necessarily going to solve every single problem or address every single need at one time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2702.945s">But</a> I do think that this is a good place to put it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2710.831s">But</a> obviously, I'd like to have more <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2713.47s">back</a> and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2715.854s">I</a> don't I welcome more back and forth on this.

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=9658.848s">Are</a> we just doing 8.1 or Section 8 as a? <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=9661.809s">Oh,</a> just 8.1. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=9662.209s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=9664.123s">So</a> just for the folks watching, I already did publish a blog post about Section 8 on my website. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=9673.929s">So</a> hopefully, none of the recommendations I'm going to make on this tonight come as a surprise. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=9680.053s">If</a> you're interested in reading about it more, it's on my website, mattLeming.com. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=9686.037s">So</a> with 8-1, my main issue with it is that I don't <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=9694.248s">really</a> see a benefit to keeping it over public participation that's already in the city council agendas. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=9706.392s">So</a> what this does is it lets anybody who gets a petition that is signed by 25 voters to put essentially anything they want on a city council agenda or school committee agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=9719.057s">And</a> then folks are free to <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=9723.458s">basically</a> submit as many of those as I want. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=9726.342s">Either</a> body has to hold a hearing on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=9729.266s">And</a> then, yeah, but I mean, the thing that gets me about this is that <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=9735.798s">people</a> are already allowed at city council meetings to show up and say anything that they like people have done that before to speak about different issues, and they're still free to do that in the, in the future so <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=9752.925s">My</a> recommend so my recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=9754.787s">My</a> first recommendation is just to strike the whole thing I do see I see it as something that could easily be abused, particularly because the signature count is so the threshold to get something on an agenda is so low. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=9770.553s">I</a> did communicate with one member of the charter study committee about this and there, I think the justification for this was that previous in previous years advocates had such a hard time getting elected officials to respond to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=9786.482s">And</a> so they just want a mechanism to sort of get elected officials to listen and respond, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=9793.278s">In</a> some of these, if there's a hearing on the agenda, I don't think that elected officials necessarily are put in a position where they have to respond to something. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=9801.985s">There</a> is a mechanism for doing so in section 8-2. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=9805.267s">But</a> yeah, my personal view of this, and I can't make a motion because I'm not on this subcommittee, but if my colleagues <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=9814.118s">my</a> colleagues feel similarly, then I would recommend this be struck, or if not, then at least the threshold of 25 signatures be raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=9823.732s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11787.39s">My</a> main thing with this is I don't see the material benefit of having this, given that we already have public participation, what I've seen happen in those public participations, where they often do take the form of a discussion regardless. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11808.334s">One</a> thing that's on my mind with this and the back and forth about the potential legal ramifications <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11817.652s">really</a> do a whole lot to enforce my confidence in this measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11823.275s">But</a> one thing that I dislike is just the idea that having a free petition in their section in there could make it unclear to residents that they're perfectly free to come to a city council meeting anyway without a free petition and just say what they like. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11840.61s">So</a> there's that. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11843.211s">I</a> do see a way that, especially with the 25 signatures, I do see plenty of opportunity to abuse this. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11852.455s">And</a> I think from what I've heard, this whole subcommittee is generally in favor of at least raising that threshold. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11862.177s">Just</a> just a general comment just a little bit more broadly than this like I do notice that, you know, when making different arguments for and against different parts that go into this charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11875.189s">People</a> have like. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11879.114s">I</a> think people have been pretty selective about when they use public support for these different things in their favor and when they just want to ignore public support in favor of their own opinions or experiences. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11890.282s">I</a> mean, you know, I've heard folks from the Charter Study Committee say that they really want a certain part of the charter to pass or be changed because public feedback or comment supports that. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11904.532s">But</a> then there's other parts where <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11907.987s">If</a> opinions happen to disagree with the public feedback that they've gotten, then you try to discount that. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11916.85s">So</a> I think that if we're going to have this argument, sorry, have these debates, then we should at least be consistent with how we treat survey data, for instance. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11931.354s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11932.434s">And</a> otherwise, I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11935.673s">This</a> particular section, again, I just don't see a whole lot of material benefit on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11940.976s">I'm</a> still open to having that be explained to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=11944.479s">But</a> yeah, no, that's my take on it.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=14125.421s">Well,</a> so I did have questions I was hoping the Collins Center could address as to the relationship between this and 8-3, if that's acceptable.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=14139.69s">So</a> I went over these two and thought about them in pretty big detail with <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=14152.751s">So</a> my understanding of both of these is that basically for 8-2, a citizen collects 250 signatures, and there's a committee that's formed, but I'm gonna mainly focus on the signature counts. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=14165.28s">Then</a> they then collect signatures from 5% of voters, which for Medford would be about 2,200. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=14172.164s">My</a> understanding is that that's registered voters, which would be the 44,000 number, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=14177.908s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=14179.268s">And</a> then that forces the city council or school committee to vote on that particular issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=14183.85s">And</a> if they vote no or they do something in lieu, then those citizens have an additional two months to collect an additional 5%, so 4,400 total. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=14196.494s">And</a> then that initiative gets voted on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=14200.435s">Is</a> that inaccurate? <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=14202.477s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=14202.737s">And</a> so with 8-3, it's a bit more stringent. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=14207.18s">It</a> basically says if the city or council or school committee vote on something and a group of citizens disagree with it, they basically have three weeks to collect signatures from 12% of voters, which is about 5,300. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=14222.67s">which</a> would temporarily stop that measure and then put it up for a special election. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=14226.371s">So</a> I guess the only thing I, the only kind of twist here was I understand that the advantage of 8-3 would be that it stops the, it stops the measure temporarily to wait for the special election. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=14241.899s">But</a> other than that, is there sort of like any substantive difference between an initiative and a referendum? <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=14263.243s">So</a> could somebody effectively use an initiative to accomplish what they would have done in 8-3 regardless, just with the lower signature count and more time to get those signatures? <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=14280.387s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=14287.552s">But</a> okay, but what I'm saying is for an initiative measure, if the council or school committee does something, can the citizens just have an initiative measure to undo that? <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=14296.658s">Or</a> is that not allowed for some reason with the initiative rules?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=14311.174s">Yeah,</a> so I guess what I guess, so I do understand the advantage here of having 8-3 be able to temporarily stop that. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=14322.762s">But</a> I also see it as like three weeks to collect 5,300 signatures just seems like kind of an impossible standard for somebody. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=14332.369s">And</a> it just seems a lot more likely to me that citizens that oppose a particular motion would just go with the 8-2 route. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=14340.843s">Or</a> is there, I just want to sort of understand the logic, because I've kind of been thinking about these different situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=14346.307s">And</a> I just don't understand why somebody would spend three weeks collecting 12% of signatures when they also have the option to basically collect 10% of signatures in, what is it, three, five months.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=14379.343s">OK,</a> so the referendum never doesn't actually get placed on the ballot.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=14383.946s">OK,</a> so there is no special election under 8-3.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=14398.214s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=14406.784s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=14409.205s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=14410.546s">Yeah,</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=14411.366s">I'm</a> just trying to understand why somebody would prefer a referendum, which gives them less time to collect more signatures when they could just go for an initiative.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=14447.271s">Oh.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=14449.453s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=14450.134s">Well,</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=14450.594s">So</a> I do understand that that is one <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=14454.697s">The</a> only advantage that I can see is the stopping it under the referendum so they get three so they do get three weeks to stop it, it just seems like that's a very. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=14462.147s">I</a> just don't just when it comes to collecting 5300 signatures I just don't see why any group of citizens would prefer to. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=14471.038s">to</a> go for the much higher standard instead of just going for the 10%, which they could just collect anyway.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=14498.603s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=14502.994s">Yeah,</a> that's the only advantage I can see.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15056.81s">Sorry,</a> I was a bit confused at the sudden promotion. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15063.152s">No,</a> no, I mean, I was actually just genuinely curious on the logic behind the two of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15072.394s">I</a> mean, I think what you, to me what you did say about the justification for the timeframes and what Chairman McDonnell just said also do make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15086.591s">Are</a> we not talking about recalls?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15098.572s">Well,</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15099.172s">So</a> we brought up the percentages and keeping them all at 15%. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15102.854s">And</a> so with recalls, we're going to get into this conversation, because these are related. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15112.599s">I</a> do have a couple of concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15115.081s">One</a> is the two-year terms. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15119.523s">issue.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15120.024s">So</a> my reading of the Charter Study Committee's final report was that the recalls did seem to be targeted at the mayor having a four-year term. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15129.069s">I</a> mean, that's what was written there. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15131.55s">Like</a> they said, we do need recalls because we're proposing to extend it. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15137.974s">But</a> they apply to all elected officials. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15140.375s">And</a> having the <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15142.516s">having</a> a recall on a two-year term, and I've received this feedback, it's actually in the, the Charter Study Committee collected like four comments about recalls, and three of them disfavored it. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15155.479s">One</a> of them just seemed to think it was only for, seemed to only favor for the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15159.76s">But</a> like one thing that we always hear is that, is that like basically the recall period for a two-year term is just the next election. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15167.742s">So</a> that is one criticism of that that I always hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15171.085s">The</a> other thing with the percentages in reference to a recall is for the proposed ward, district, et cetera positions, the standard seems to be very different for at-large positions versus ward positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15189.321s">So</a> 20% <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15191.002s">Right</a> now, in this current draft, it says 20% of voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15193.564s">You</a> have 40 days to collect that. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15195.125s">That's</a> about 8,800 signatures for at-large Councilors, school committee members, and the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15200.709s">That's</a> about 1,000 for award Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15205.093s">Or</a> if we go with districts, it's about 2,200. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15209.616s">So</a> the standards for those just seem to be <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15213.118s">very</a> different, and it seems that certain positions could be more subject to the, let's say it like, for lack of a better term, the threat of a recall, whereas others, it's just much harder to mobilize that number of people in that period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15228.385s">The</a> other concern that I also have is just with 8-7, which says that the city council can just put a recall, like my reading of it anyways, that the city council can just put a recall on the ballot, which <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15241.316s">for</a> any of these positions, which is another thing that makes me a little bit iffy about that, because that just seems like a lot of power for this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15256.409s">Okay,</a> so 8-7 does not imply that the City Council can just do that, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15262.253s">Okay,</a> because this is another thing that I communicated.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15272.288s">Okay,</a> so so that so that so that's that's a misconception on my part under this the City Council does not have that authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15278.914s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15279.154s">Thank</a> you for thank you for clarifying that. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15283.41s">Regardless,</a> it did seem like a lot of the recall was to prevent a situation like the one in Fall River from happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15290.414s">So</a> that, I think, was the most egregious instance of the need for a recall and a constitutional crisis that happened there. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15297.117s">But</a> it also seems like this draft of the charter does kind of solve that, because it automatically throws out any elected official who is convicted of a felony. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15306.522s">So</a> that does seem like some of those extreme cases are addressed by that. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15313.225s">area.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15313.546s">So</a> those are those are my kind of so okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15317.528s">So</a> those are my thoughts on the recall. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15319.59s">And</a> if my reading of 87 was incorrect, then I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15324.453s">I'll</a> update whatever it before on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15326.855s">But</a> but yeah, so that's just to put it out there for my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=15331.238s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=16122.517s">No,</a> just want to reiterate the other point of recalls that I disfavor, but maybe we just want to emphasize it in this case. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=16131.48s">And</a> I don't know how this is played out in other municipalities. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=16134.621s">It's</a> just that the at-large positions have a much, much higher <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=16140.042s">amount</a> of effort required to initiate that recall than award Councilor, and everybody gets equal votes on this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=16146.647s">So</a> in a situation where it takes 1 4th or 1 8th of the signatures to get one elected official on the ballot versus another, that's something where, like, have you seen that dynamic affect any other municipalities or can you comment on it?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=16184.999s">But</a> for like a ward position, that just makes them more? <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=16191.073s">Well,</a> yeah, but that does make them, I mean, doesn't that, in effect, make them more vulnerable to potential threats of a recall?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=16211.34s">Well,</a> it's a smaller pool, but the amount of manpower required to get those signatures is.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=16228.508s">Is</a> there a lot for at-large Councilors in comparison?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=16241.877s">Why</a> is that? <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=16242.538s">I'm</a> just curious, just actually.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=16272.448s">The</a> other thing the other thing on my mind with like, and this only applies to out large positions really and like the mathematics of a recall is that for like let's like hypothetically let's say we did like a recall on like a member of this body, the actual threshold of votes to be able to get onto this body seems like for a lot of positions, it would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=16293.251s">It's</a> a lower threshold to get on than it would be to keep your seat. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=16297.616s">So</a> I received the least votes to get elected to city council out of anybody on this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=16303.943s">Actually,</a> I think I believe four people received less than half the ballots cast. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=16311.131s">But</a> in order to retain your seat in a recall, you need more than half the votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=16316.095s">So</a> that's another thing that makes me iffy about this is that it's a different standard for keeping your seat in a recall versus actually getting on in the first place. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=16326.164s">And</a> I understand that's a hypothetical, but just from a mathematical standpoint, that's the other thing making me iffy about applying recalls. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=16338.851s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=16339.331s">No,</a> that's all I got. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=16340.071s">That's</a> all I got.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=16411.597s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=16414.215s">Yeah,</a> that was, so in another piece of the Charter Study Committee's review, there was, I believe it was in North Brookline, where two select men put on a, or like, I guess, put on a pride parade, and then people started collecting signatures for that recall to get them voted off because they put on a pride parade. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=16435.921s">I</a> believe that was part of the Charter Study Committee's research. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=16439.122s">And</a> that never even made it onto the ballot, but it made the news. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=16443.306s">which</a> is kind of another thing that, like another component of this.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=17056.717s">So</a> City City agency is defined under one seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=17061.88s">Um,</a> my understanding it says any multiple member body, any department, division or office of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=17070.485s">So</a> my understanding is that would <a href="https://youtu.be/K4SSXzHHj90&t=17073.362s">cover</a> it?<h2><a href="../2025-02-13_PXpDguzCygs/2025-02-13_PXpDguzCygs.html">City Council Planning and Permitting Committee 02-12-25</a></h2>
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2537.035s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2537.335s">So</a> just some general requests for the consultants and city staff either to clarify what's currently <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2547.334s">in</a> the zoning or what some of the options could be moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2551.278s">So</a> I'm currently working in a city group that is investigating the possibility of starting up a community land trust and we were looking at a couple of different potential city-owned parcels around the city and some of them were <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2571.844s">some</a> of them were constrained by current zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2575.888s">So</a> even if we were to decide to put a community land trust in some of these areas, it would be very little community owned affordable housing that could actually be built. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2587.24s">So</a> I would like to know just for a future meeting or <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2592.865s">what</a> are the options for even an email? <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2594.046s">What</a> some options for something like that would be like, um, what are the cities? <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2601.273s">Uh,</a> there's a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2602.794s">What</a> are the cities are currently currently offer in terms of an inclusionary overlay? <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2609.019s">Um</a> and is there a possibility of putting <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2616.085s">is</a> infill zoning going to be a part of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2620.027s">That's</a> another thing that I would like to see just kind of mentioned or explored. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2630.19s">I've</a> also been pushing a lot for a transportation demand management program because, which I understand we're going to discuss in April, but Everett has implemented that very successfully, and I would <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2645.075s">like</a> to see if some of the consultants would be able to reach out to some of the planners within Everett to understand some of the details of how they've implemented that and whether it's only applied to urban areas or whether something like that usually goes into residential areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2662.583s">Essentially</a> just a little bit more information on some of these <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2667.066s">not</a> specifically the zoning maps, but some of the rules that could apply to residential areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2675.831s">So,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=2751.307s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4471.858s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4472.498s">So</a> not to go down, not to explore various steps of the rabbit hole too much, but just to remind the planners and consultants, some of the folks at Housing Medford and I did work on a draft of an ADU ordinance a couple of months ago, which we <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4495.123s">discussed</a> pretty extensively. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4497.888s">So</a> I just want to make sure that that draft is on your radar. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4504.198s">And</a> if it's sort of buried in layers of emails, then I can resend that to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4509.683s">Um,</a> as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4511.664s">Um,</a> I understand that some parts of it might have changed because the some of the recent like state laws been updated since then. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4520.066s">So</a> it's possible that, um, that that version of the ordinance parts of that version of the ordinance could be irrelevant. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4527.808s">But</a> a lot of the work on rethinking 80 years has been done by local housing advocates. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4533.69s">Um,</a> do y'all currently have that drafted? <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4537.613s">like</a> sitting around somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4538.734s">I</a> know that Danielle, we had a meeting about that.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4583.345s">I'd</a> explored the topic specifically. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4586.486s">Parts</a> of it were, it was like, <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4589.361s">the</a> owner occupancy requirement I think was the was kind of the biggest like area of disagreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4594.243s">There</a> were sort of good points on both sides about that and there is also like you know converting whether just like details of like converting a garage to an ADU versus like an attached ADU things like that but a lot of it should be in the draft of the the draft ordinance that we went over. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4617.069s">Although</a> I do understand that it was <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4619.51s">many</a> moons ago at this point that we last discussed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4622.512s">But</a> it is coming up on the timeline to get to that part of the discussion.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4734.199s">So</a> I'll just re-share the documents, because I'm actually looking at a document in my Google Drive which has <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4742.259s">a</a> lot of edits from the both of us from almost a year ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4745.842s">So</a> that probably is a good refresher, but it doesn't have to be re like we don't have to go and down the rabbit hole too much during the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=4753.969s">But</a> thank you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8589.018s">Hello,</a> thank you for the comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8592.241s">So</a> part of the very small comment that I made earlier, which I requested the consultants to look into, were different provisions to essentially incentivize or allow different forms of affordable housing in, in, <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8612.998s">residential</a> areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8614.039s">And</a> so that's what I'm hoping to hear about at the next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8622.764s">Two</a> points about affordable housing, which is that generally the more housing that they're <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8628.807s">that</a> there is in a given area, the more affordable it becomes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8634.609s">I</a> mean, usually when they're making like an apartment building or construction, developers are strongly incentivized to make a certain percentage of the units there be affordable, which normally means that the income can't <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8654.214s">go</a> above 80% area and area median income if you're going to live there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8662.561s">We</a> can't just make it so that you have to have 100% affordable units for developers otherwise nobody would try to develop there and they wouldn't be able to <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8673.751s">make</a> a profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8674.452s">And</a> that's just that's the reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8676.054s">So</a> when mandating affordable housing, there are parts of that under the zoning, which we'll get to later, which do which strongly <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8688.202s">incentivize</a> that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8689.183s">So</a> the TDM program that I've been pushing to for, um, in other communities, those actually do contain strong incentives for affordable units. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8699.731s">Um,</a> I have to look at the details of the green score. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8703.174s">I'm</a> not sure if that's, if that's a part of that, but it, it could be, um, yeah, the just, I'm just kind of thinking, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8719.083s">Yeah,</a> so, oh yeah, and so there are other instances in Medford where we do have 100% affordable units like in Wachling Court, but the thing about that is that it's usually a bunch of layered government grants to actually be able to build that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8737.577s">That's</a> kind of something that goes outside of zoning itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8741.48s">So</a> the point is when making affordable housing, it's not like something where we can <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8747.645s">wave</a> of magic wand to make it happen, but in creating this new zoning, there are very strong incentives that we can do to kind of make it so that when developers are making their spreadsheets, it would be the most profitable option for them to create a percentage of affordable units. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8767.726s">And</a> again, in general, <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8769.807s">the</a> more units that you end up creating, the more new building that there is, the more affordable a community becomes in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8778.671s">So</a> thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=8780.292s">I</a> think that what you bring up is a wonderful point that is being experienced by many people in our generation.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9305.469s">Yeah,</a> a lot of the reason we're doing this in the first place is to incentivize affordable housing in the city so to hear my colleagues say that this won't do anything to help affordable housing is wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9319.014s">I</a> mean it's, it's just plain wrong I'm sure he's going to come up with a retort for that but we talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9327.582s">like</a> we're talking about building more, we're talking about mandating a certain percentage of affordable units. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9336.009s">That's</a> all like, that's a lot of what I, that's a lot of what I campaigned on. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9340.032s">I</a> mean, my colleague yesterday was basically saying that when residents were coming up to him and asking him about zoning, like he couldn't explain it to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9351.502s">And</a> now he's coming here and saying that, <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9355.642s">Now</a> he's coming here and saying that he can say definitively that it's not gonna help affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9360.424s">No,</a> I mean, it's politically convenient to demonize this whole zoning process. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9366.267s">I</a> don't know why, but like that is a huge reason behind doing this in the first place is to help out with Medford's affordability problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9376.111s">So</a> that's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9379.512s">Like,</a> I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9381.053s">I</a> don't know why you'd say that.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9740.41s">Yeah,</a> most of this Council likes to engage in <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9744.438s">productive</a> projects and facts, most of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9749.285s">But,</a> you know, these issues do become politicized and that's inevitable. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9755.753s">One</a> thing I would like to point out, because when I answered the question initially, I tried to focus on <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9762.863s">what</a> the zoning is doing to help out with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9765.045s">But</a> the fact is that for a long period of time, this city council, not this current term, but this body in general didn't really care too much about affordable housing or just never really that high on anybody's to-do list. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9781.76s">One</a> of the projects outside of zoning that we've been engaging in is the <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9788.086s">implementing</a> the Affordable Housing Trust, which is basically it's just a pile of money that the city can build up and then put towards affordable housing projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9800.511s">I</a> believe it was back in 1989 or so that cities were allowed to make them, and Somerville created their Affordable Housing Trust way back when. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9810.935s">Medford,</a> when it was initiating its linkage fee program, it could have created an Affordable Housing Trust, <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9817.537s">but</a> it never did. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9818.317s">It</a> created trusts for water and sewers, parks. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9822.999s">It</a> created trust for the parks, never created an affordable housing trust until 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9829.02s">So</a> in creating a lot of the infrastructure, the instruments of municipal governments that so many other communities took for granted when it comes to supporting affordable housing, Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9844.913s">is</a> really behind the curve when it comes out. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9849.054s">We</a> have a lot of catching up to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9850.795s">And</a> the city council, part of the reason that we've been so productive in so many different ways is because we have been busy implementing a lot of these things that so many other communities take for granted. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9865.919s">One</a> of those is the affordable housing trust one of those is trying to fund a nexus study to update our affordable housing linkage fees that we could actually put some money towards affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9877.026s">And</a> I hope that with all of our efforts, including the zoning including everything else that we're able to put a dent. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9885.098s">in</a> this problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9886.519s">So,</a> I mean, my colleague said, there's a lot of other factors that play into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9893.565s">This</a> is an issue that goes into the federal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9896.587s">This</a> is an issue that you can blame the federal government on, the state government. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9900.33s">And</a> yes, it is an issue that gets politicized. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9903.673s">Zoning</a> is gonna get politicized. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9905.675s">It</a> already has been in these chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9907.936s">But</a> even so, we are going to push forward because <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9911.859s">I</a> knocked on about 8,000 doors to get elected. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9916.622s">And</a> the thing that I kept hearing from the most people from the residents of Medford was, why hasn't anything changed significantly in like the last 50 years? <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9925.667s">And</a> zoning is a really big part of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9928.009s">So,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PXpDguzCygs&t=9930.83s">Thank</a> you all for listening and apologies for making this meeting go on for longer than it needed to.<h2><a href="../2025-02-11_szFUz6VjxpM/2025-02-11_szFUz6VjxpM.html">City Council 02-11-25</a></h2>

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3040.907s">Yes,</a> I'd like to thank my colleague for putting this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3044.549s">So</a> to offer a little bit more insight into the background of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3049.972s">So</a> a lot of the parents who have been advocating for these programs have been doing so for years and years, and they haven't, I think at this point, a lot of them have just been advocating so long, they feel like they're talking to a brick wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3063.539s">So</a> part of the, <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3065.28s">purpose</a> of this is to just make sure that everybody that the parents, Council, the city and Medford recreation are on the same page in terms of vision for what these programs look like and they're, it's, it's, <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3082.062s">a</a> lot of details that like, well, I guess seem like details to the folks, to some folks, but a huge deal to the parents, like whether or not the programs are going to be designed for just kids or kids and teens, whether they're going to be sports based, what times are going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3096.605s">So</a> I think the parents would just like some clarity with Medford recreation on what, on what that would look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3105.747s">And</a> it would be, <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3108.52s">productive</a> to get these discussions on the public record. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3113.602s">I</a> also am excited to hear that my colleague is working with neighboring communities and implementing and starting up these sorts of after school programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/szFUz6VjxpM&t=3127.389s">I</a> think that's a wonderful initiative.<h2><a href="../2025-01-29_R2VsFLRcTzA/2025-01-29_R2VsFLRcTzA.html">City Council Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee 01-29-25</a></h2>

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=410.883s">Do</a> you think we should also clarify exactly what was referred out of governance in that case? <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=416.306s">I</a> mean, it's not for sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=419.227s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=440.733s">I'm</a> just going to say the committee referred
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=470.156s">Refer</a> discussion of any potential edits. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=473.198s">Yeah,</a> something along those lines.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=564.872s">Yeah,</a> I would, I would say, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=570.23s">combined,</a> it would probably make it a little bit cleaner to combine the points about CCOPS and the welcoming city ordinance from the January 14th meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=583.337s">So</a> that's one way to sort of shorten it a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=597.483s">We</a> also so that that's yeah and then January passed a resolution for more activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=614.006s">We</a> approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=628.76s">I</a> don't know if that's a good way to describe it.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=647.773s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=648.234s">Hold</a> on. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=651.176s">I'm</a> going to unshare the screen to keep some emails private, but I'm not gonna <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=660.648s">I</a> just added your emails to this.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=707.552s">I</a> mean we really did just do a lot of January 14 meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=712.434s">And</a> i'm also just going to go and combine the two liquor licenses.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=738.849s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=740.09s">I</a> mean, I think this is overall pretty good. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=743.751s">I'm</a> just going to wait on Councilor Tseng to finish his thoughts on the City Council composition. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=758.679s">Yeah,</a> I think what you have right there is fine, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=762.06s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=766.179s">Councilor</a> Callahan.

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=792.686s">Okay,</a> I'll just put it a later date.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=815.72s">We</a> also, wait, so just from the commissioner,
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=837.102s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=841.144s">January</a> 29th meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=843.185s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=843.705s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=845.466s">And</a> we're developing an open data policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=860.522s">I</a> guess we don't need to get that specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=871.27s">Yeah,</a> I think just just saying we began our work developing an open data policy or January 29 the meeting is sufficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=877.775s">I</a> mean, you should be really quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=881.854s">bullet</a> points. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=882.334s">We</a> also haven't actually had that discussion yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=884.836s">So</a> we have yet to, um, but no, I think that what we have now is we have now is fine.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=901.31s">Any</a> other comments from Councilors?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=927.815s">January</a> 28, we passed the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=932.197s">Is</a> it Lunar New Year or the Lunar New Year? <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=935.293s">Is</a> it Lunar New Year or the third? <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=937.534s">Never</a> mind.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=944.476s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=944.856s">Any</a> other comments from councilors? <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=946.817s">Do</a> we have a motion on the floor? <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=950.178s">Do</a> we have a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=951.259s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=952.719s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=952.999s">On</a> the motion to approve <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=955.013s">the</a> current draft of the newsletter. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=956.955s">Including</a> edits, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=958.636s">Including</a> edits by Councilor Callahan, seconded by Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=963.059s">Mr.</a> Clerk, when you're ready, will you please call the roll?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=969.284s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=981.353s">Wait,</a> what? <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=981.873s">Sorry?</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=988.764s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=990.285s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=990.805s">The</a> clerk is he's still he's still preparing the notes. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=994.608s">Sorry</a> about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=996.85s">Your</a> apology is accepted. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=999.152s">Councilor</a> Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1005.297s">Sorry.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1018.08s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1019.461s">Affirmative.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1022.923s">Negative.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1023.643s">The</a> motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1026.284s">Next</a> thing we're going to discuss is the development of the open data policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1034.869s">So</a> we <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1038.244s">introduce</a> this as something to refer to committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1042.306s">Initially,</a> Councilor Tseng and myself, and prior to the meeting, after Councilor Tseng and I did a bit of research on this, we distributed a sample ordinance from the city of Cambridge, as well as an executive order from the city of Boston, which gives sample language of other open data policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1065.775s">Um,</a> we also drafted a couple of questions to, uh, give out to, uh, department heads to just basically get some more information about what kind of data they're sitting on. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1078.779s">As</a> we, uh, uh, develop some of the parameters of this policy, uh, Councilor Tseng, is there anything you'd like to say?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1266.307s">I</a> can read them.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1334.892s">So</a> before I go to other Councilors, I'm not going to read through the entirety of the Cambridge and Boston sample ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1345.488s">Given</a> that Cambridge and Boston tend to be a lot more well-financed to support things like this, I developed a list of questions for some of the department heads that I think have relevant data sets, along with just inquiries about their <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1366.762s">staff</a> capacity to implement these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1369.647s">So</a> the first question goes to the mayor, which is just what is the administration view as practical concerns to enacting an open data policy along the lines of Boston and Cambridge's policies? <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1381.062s">And</a> this is because it is the mayor is the person in charge of department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1386.044s">So</a> they will, they do have a lot of ability in overseeing this, even with the ordinance enacted. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1393.567s">The</a> general question for department heads, the general request for the mayor is to request that city departments report to the resident services and public engagement committee on what data or records are currently <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1404.332s">commonly</a> requested them, what data or records they collect and what data or records they would feel open to sharing with the public and why or why not. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1413.296s">I</a> also thought of six or five other departments that I know I've specifically worked with or tried to work with their data in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1423.039s">So</a> these are just kind of more targeted questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1425.42s">First,</a> the elections office. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1427.523s">How</a> far back does elections data historically go both in a digital format and paper archives? <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1432.425s">And</a> do you have the staff capacity and resources to digitize Medford's election data from before 2005? <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1438.488s">So</a> this one in particular is interesting because the elections website just kind of posts PDFs and sort of inconsistent formats. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1447.072s">And</a> the data only goes back to 2005. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1449.773s">I</a> do know that they have paper records in the basement that go back further, but <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1456.597s">I</a> do need to respect the staff capacity of the elections office when it comes to their ability to go down there and write down all of those data points from previous generations. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1469.663s">even</a> though I personally would be interested in seeing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1472.927s">From</a> the Finance Office, how far back does Medford digitized budgetary data go? <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1477.433s">Are</a> there legal or ethical concerns with publishing the bulk data in an analyzable format? <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1482.559s">Do</a> you have the staff capacity and resources to publish bulk budgetary data consistently for public use? <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1488.646s">The</a> idea behind this one is that usually budget data is published in either different meeting records or in a big PDF that's released every year, and that's excellent, but it would be useful to have data in a <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1507.257s">kind</a> of more of a spreadsheet format so that could be analyzed with software so that residents can track if they wanted two different uses of the budget over time and how that's evolved over the years, which I think would help inform the public conversation around this. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1521.324s">From</a> the assessor's office, how far back does Medford's historic assessor's data go? <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1525.746s">Are</a> there legal or ethical concerns to publishing bulk property value assessment data in an analyzable format? <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1530.849s">And</a> do you have the staff capacity and resource to publish bulk assessor's data consistently for public use? <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1536.371s">So</a> the assessor's data right now publishes everything via the Vision Government Solutions website, which is actually, so all assessment data is available online. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1546.999s">But</a> again, if you wanted to analyze like the average assessment value of all Medford property or the all Medford property in like West Medford or something like that, it would be very difficult to do that via what's currently available. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1560.308s">I</a> do know that the assessor's office has internal data. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1565.665s">that</a> they use that they could just put online in spreadsheet format, so I don't think this is big ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1570.949s">From</a> the DPW, does the DPW use spreadsheet data internally to keep track of road repair streets and so on? <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1576.773s">How</a> far back does this data historically go? <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1578.954s">Are</a> there any legal or ethical concerns with publishing this data openly? <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1581.996s">Again,</a> just residents want to see how what roads are being repaired and just being able to analyze that historically, so that's more of an open-end one. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1590.062s">And</a> from the building department, the same question about <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1594.805s">inspections,</a> permitting requests, and so on that would be publishable as a database for the properties around Medford, legal, procedural, ethical concerns with publishing the data, how far back they decided to go historically, and the staff capacity question. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1609.611s">So</a> the motion on the floor would be to send these questions out to the mayor and the relevant department heads, but I'm also interested in hearing if my colleagues have any <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1623.968s">thoughts</a> or anything that they would like to add. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1634.673s">Councilor</a> Callahan and then Councilor Lazzaro.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1687.787s">Um,</a> would we be able to just, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1690.624s">add</a> that because in the second line, the general request, I think, um, covers a lot of what you mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1701.937s">It's</a> a request to the mayor and city departments to report to this committee anything that they think would be interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1707.703s">Essentially,</a> Councilor Lazzaro.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1775.957s">I</a> could take that, but I see that Councilor is saying also, did you want to address that or do you have your own? <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1785.519s">Yeah,</a> so <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1790.15s">This</a> does come with the caveat in a lot of these questions about staff capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1795.833s">So</a> we are asking that, and that is a concern, especially if, I mean, we can't just copy the open data policies of cities that have a much larger budget than ours wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1812.541s">But</a> there are, the point of these questions is to sort of figure out if there are, <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1818.833s">low-hanging</a> fruit, I hate that term, but it is used to describe the situation, that they could just easily post to their website. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1830.519s">So</a> I know, for instance, that that's the case with the assessor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1834.04s">They</a> already work with spreadsheet data internally, and it really wouldn't be any skin off their back to just put it onto the website instead of the typical databases. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1850.056s">And</a> with the elections office, it's really not that much data. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1854.479s">It's</a> really just typing out the spreadsheets that they normally publish in PDF formats into something that's a little bit cleaner. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1863.205s">Councilor?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1865.466s">But</a> yeah, that is a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1866.787s">Councilor</a> Tseng? <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1867.568s">Did</a> you? <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1870.55s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=1946.617s">Councilor</a> Callahan and then Councilor Lazzaro.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2016.988s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2034.343s">Okay,</a> we could add that as an additional boil point under General Councilor was our.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2168.708s">Councilor</a> Tseng.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2182.612s">Missing</a> the horse for the forest. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2184.352s">Yeah,</a> missing the horse for the forest. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2186.253s">Putting</a> the cart before the trees, something like that.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2265.512s">So</a> yeah, I'll address some of Councilor Lazzaro's points. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2270.738s">So</a> my thinking on this is like when residents are discussing a budget, oftentimes those discussions do get a little bit, let's say, <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2284.431s">misdirected</a> because it is, unless you've dug through those giant PDFs before, it is a little bit difficult to find them, whereas if hypothetically a bunch of Excel sheets of budgetary data were available for multiple years, <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2301.353s">Then</a> you could get like a few residents who are very interested in that to just like comb through those and like really be able to find out what the patterns are. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2308.295s">I</a> think the state does a very good job of providing that data at a very bird's eye view for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2314.697s">Now</a> I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2317.138s">staff</a> capacity to support this would really come into play when like if we're like asking departments to develop these databases or APIs and stuff like that, which is mentioned in the Cambridge's open data policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2329.55s">I</a> just don't think that we have the software engineering capacity to do that, but if it's something as simple as asking the assessor's office to publish <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2340.34s">their</a> PDFs, or sorry, their Excel spreadsheets of historical assessment data openly so that that can be combed through. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2347.205s">I</a> think that's a good place to start. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2348.446s">That</a> wouldn't have too much task capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2351.888s">Councilor</a> Lazzaro?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2405.883s">Yeah,</a> no, I always appreciate good conversations here about staff capacity because we do need to be <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2413.566s">realistic</a> about that, and that does tend to dominate a lot of conversations in this room, so it's always welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2421.434s">But</a> in any case, Councilor Tseng, did you record in a master document all of the proposed edits that we've been speaking about so far? <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2447.27s">No,</a> I think I think that was that was about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2449.431s">There</a> was requests. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2452.992s">Um,</a> that the mayor and city departments, I suppose, would capture Councilor Callahan's initial comment on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2462.677s">That</a> could be an additional one. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2463.957s">But</a> otherwise, I think that that's pretty much everything.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2469.61s">Otherwise,</a> I think that that's all the edits that we discussed so far.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2487.046s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2487.167s">You</a> going to email it to me?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2493.032s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2518.525s">Do</a> we have a second?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2523.127s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2523.767s">On</a> the <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2527.592s">Wait,</a> oh, amen. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2533.394s">One</a> moment, I'm gonna, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2537.215s">Everybody's,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2540.156s">Sorry,</a> I'm like doing a, I'm doing a, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2543.257s">Okay,</a> for the amendment, just.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2602.449s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2607.452s">On</a> the motion by Councilor Tseng, I believe I actually heard Councilor Lazzaro second that one.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2620.036s">Yes,</a> yes, Councilor, I think, I feel like people who attend on Zoom often miss the valuable seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2626.918s">So</a> I'm gonna say that it was Councilor Lazzaro who seconded it this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2631.079s">With</a> apologies to all. <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2634.159s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2634.459s">Thank</a> you, thank you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R2VsFLRcTzA&t=2639.701s">Mr.</a> Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1820.356s">I'll</a> try to be brief as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1822.438s">No,</a> no, I'm just putting in the chat right here a zoom chat spreadsheet that was literally I just copied and pasted it from the from something that the assessor gave me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1834.368s">So</a> if folks are <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1838.967s">see</a> their property tax bills and they're a bit confused about this, then this is a read-only spreadsheet. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1844.249s">But</a> if you go to File, Download, then you'll be able to download the spreadsheet and input your FY 25 and 24 assessed home values <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1854.532s">into</a> under the green column and that should give a breakdown of the of your third and fourth quarter payments as well as the impact from the override and I hope that that can clarify. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1871.032s">any</a> confusion that residents might have had when they got their tax bills in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1878.035s">But</a> at the end of the day, if you add up the Q1 to Q4 tax bills, then it should just add up to that $8.80 per $1,000 of assessed property value instead of 837. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1895.102s">But</a> you do have to add up all of them in aggregate. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1899.541s">So</a> yeah, I just wanted to share that resource for folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1901.983s">I</a> put it out over my own mailing list, and I'm just hoping it could be out there for people to look over and mess with to understand the numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=1909.23s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3282.242s">Yeah,</a> so just looking at the original text, and I just peeked at the B paper, I'm more inclined to support the text of the B paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3289.95s">With</a> the original text of this resolution, I have mixed feelings about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3295.616s">Whereas</a> the city did not educate or prepare our residents in their overwhelming tax bill, I do agree that <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3305.816s">better</a> communication could have been done prior to the release of the third quarter tax bill just to explain to everybody what was happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3317.0s">So</a> I can get behind that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3319.461s">But</a> the line here, whereas the increased taxes have negatively affected our homeowners, things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3328.164s">I</a> worked with a lot of parents who are homeowners who worked very hard to see these passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3335.475s">I</a> was on Monday night in a meeting with some of the school committee of Melrose who just tried to have an override and it failed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3345.3s">And</a> they had to lay off 17 teachers because of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3349.882s">And</a> in Medford, we didn't have to do that because of those parents who worked so hard to see these overrides passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3355.644s">So</a> I don't think it negatively affected homeowners because <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3361.925s">A</a> lot of those homeowners had kids, and their kids are benefiting by teachers not being laid off. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3366.129s">And</a> the homeowners are going to benefit with extra staff in the DBW to repair a road. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3371.293s">So</a> again, I definitely think that there could have been more education around the calculation of the tax bills earlier on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3385.322s">and</a> obviously any tax increase will have its upsides and downsides, but I don't see a need to budget inch when I say that we absolutely needed the override and it is doing a lot of good. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3398.644s">We</a> had a school committee meeting that involved a budget that was not depressing for the first time in ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3407.126s">People</a> actually got what they wanted because we actually had extra money to invest in our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3410.647s">So</a> the overrides were a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=3414.333s">That's</a> all I have to say.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4245.059s">No,</a> I was just gonna recommend that.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4251.922s">No,</a> I was just gonna recommend to go to admin finance.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4274.512s">I</a> mean, parking is part of the culture here.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4722.951s">So</a> to clarify the rule change, it was on the January 14th agenda, which I'm looking at now, the refer to committee for further discussion was put before the hearings section. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4737.586s">So</a> I'm not sure if that is necessarily supposed to be that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4743.272s">But</a> the point is that <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4746.81s">I</a> think this body needs to start being honest with itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4750.552s">We</a> do talk a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4752.593s">And</a> once we get going, it's kind of hard to stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4755.655s">And</a> once you start with the refer to committee for further discussion, which I'm sure I did two weeks ago, then that's like really when that meeting goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4766.081s">So</a> the point of the rule was to make it so that the hearings come directly after the reports of committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4772.725s">And</a> it's just meant to be one of those automatic, <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4775.807s">automatic</a> things. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4776.647s">And</a> then we get to the refer. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4779.309s">So</a> it's a small change. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4781.37s">But</a> last time, we did have the folks from the establishment just kind of waiting here until 11 when we could have cleared them really quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4794.297s">But</a> we kind of forgot about it and then decided to suspend the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4799.2s">And</a> so this is just meant to, the idea behind this is that we <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4804.243s">usually</a> get through the beginning of the meeting pretty automatically, reports of committees and so on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=4808.89s">And</a> then I just would like the hearings to come directly after that, to not become the culture that we suspend rules and start taking things out of order until the hearings are done.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5106.762s">Well,</a> in that case, it does sound like multiple Councilors have kind of different thoughts on how to address this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5116.025s">So</a> I would motion to, I'm not sure whether to table it or to send this to committee so that it could be worked on a bit further pending Councilor Scarpelli's discussions.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5132.603s">Okay,</a> well, governance committee is pretty busy, but we'll find a time.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5350.025s">Yes,</a> and just to just be clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5352.967s">So</a> I do understand the intention behind the referred to committee for further discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5357.47s">I've</a> just found that when Councilors get to talking about their own resolutions, they do kind of tend to go off. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5367.197s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5368.165s">uh,</a> you know, talk a little bit more than maybe is intended. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5370.767s">And</a> so the intention is just to get the hearings out of the way before that process starts. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=5375.15s">But</a> if, uh, but either way, I would motion to refer this to governance.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8057.063s">So</a> to support this, I've been in, I've had some conversations with the mayor about this particular project, because I've been generally advocating for her to fund an affordable housing nexus study, which would help us to, which would help the city to establish an affordable housing linkage fee program, which would end up <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8081.306s">getting</a> a lot more money into affordable housing than that initial investment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8085.631s">And</a> my understanding is that the revenues from this sale would be able to fund that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8094.901s">Now,</a> I do share my colleagues' concerns about potentially changing the character of the neighborhood, but I think <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8102.74s">a</a> lot of that would be addressed with zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8107.882s">So</a> developers can't necessarily do whatever they want with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8114.024s">I</a> do sympathize with the need for right of first refusal, but as the attorney just explained, we can't legally do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8122.727s">So</a> given the options, I think it would be best to vote in favor of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8127.748s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8257.142s">Oh,</a> I'm on, I guess.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8362.887s">So</a> I'm on the community land trust working group. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8367.69s">It's</a> still very early in the process, but there are a number of city-owned parcels that we're currently investigating. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8379.338s">This</a> isn't one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8380.199s">There</a> are just better options out there for other pieces of land that could be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8385.802s">I</a> don't wanna like name any particular parcels because we still need to like <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8390.025s">look</a> into each one particularly like individually but this isn't this is just proposing to use the proceeds of that and one of them is to afford a nexus study which would then be used for for the purposes of actually developing a program that would then fund the affordable housing trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8409.801s">So</a> it is pretty <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8412.623s">needed</a> to get that initial capital in order to fund the studies that would then put more money into the Affordable Housing Trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8420.027s">So</a> I mean, I mean, I think that getting getting this through as soon as like, as soon as possible without any delays would be <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8435.066s">would</a> be the appropriate move personally just because we have been talking about a nexus study since last year when we were updating the linkage fees and we can't really do any more with the linkage fees until we get that study underway. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=8451.67s">So</a> I understand that selling off city-owned land is a pretty, can be a pretty sensitive topic, but if this land hasn't been used since 1950, then I really don't see much of a reason to delay much more on this personally.<h2><a href="../2025-01-22_aHlZXhM2wEw/2025-01-22_aHlZXhM2wEw.html">City Council Governance Committee 01-22-25</a></h2>
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4174.951s">Thank</a> you, Chair Sang, for letting me speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4178.594s">Just</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4179.418s">To</a> clarify for the folks at home, neither Councilor Callahan nor I are on this committee, which means that we can't vote or make motions, but we are at the invitation of the chair able to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4195.685s">The</a> one concern that I had was eliminating the part that says the mayor and city council is that you likely would need some support from the executive branch when advertising for the positions that go <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4212.131s">that</a> would go into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4213.652s">So</a> it would help to, you know, have the support from the executive branch to be able to put out feelers. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4220.514s">I</a> fully support having it be confirmed by having them be confirmed by a vote of the city council, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4225.795s">So</a> that's just that's just one thought as a potential consequence of removing the mayor and city council, keeping it just city councils that I think would be you do need some staff support for this kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4239.6s">I</a> would imagine. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4241.12s">Um</a> And also the city solicitor would be Under under the mayor as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4248.068s">So</a> that's another concern I would have with removing that explicitly. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4252.594s">I</a> did have some questions about this for the call in center. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4257.599s">If</a> I'm if I'm able, um <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4261.271s">So</a> this struck me as a, so two questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4267.556s">One,</a> is this something that is typically in ordinances in other cities? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4271.318s">And</a> if so, what usually results from that? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4278.424s">So</a> have there been, are there usually like pretty substantial changes that come out of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4283.247s">committees,</a> periodic reviews. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4285.809s">Are</a> there any specific instances you can think of where this might have affected policy in the past? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4292.414s">I</a> just feel like a little bit more historical context would help me out with this one.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4327.592s">So</a> the real point of this is to make sure that the ordinances are consistent with any updates to the charter.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4334.554s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6361.736s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6363.357s">I'd</a> also just suggest as a potential compromise here, and I understand that this option wasn't really investigated too much by the Charter Study Committee, but having a 5-4 system, five at large, four district based as a possible in between option. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6386.968s">I</a> can't make a motion for that, but I <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6391.73s">think</a> it does. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6392.33s">I</a> think that that would address some of the concerns with some of the words being too small and also expand the council, which I hear which I think a lot of residents have really been asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6408.754s">I</a> do agree with my colleagues on some of the <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6415.708s">issues</a> with expanding the council, namely the length of meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6419.029s">So</a> I would support a change to the council rules limiting individual councilor speaking times that would only go into effect after the expansion of the council, if that were the decision that this body ended up making. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6439.553s">That</a> would be <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6441.249s">that</a> those rules wouldn't necessarily go into the charter itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6445.11s">But</a> I strongly believe that it would help to make meetings more efficient and keep a keep a cap on the time that these meetings end up going to. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6459.633s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-01-21_a6bZISOstiw/2025-01-21_a6bZISOstiw.html">City Council Public Works and Facilities Committee 01-21-25</a></h2>

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3183.637s">Thank</a> you, Liz. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3184.498s">Wonderful</a> presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3186.219s">I'm</a> glad to see this. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3188.181s">Glad</a> to see this coming for the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3190.422s">Actually,</a> just if you could clarify, Council President Bears, since your comment earlier indicated you might know something about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3196.666s">So</a> I'm actually also a member of the EAU Church, just like Councilor Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3204.192s">Could</a> you clarify sort of the <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3208.035s">ethics</a> issues behind behind this, if any, or like you mentioned that we could still vote on this, because we're not personally benefiting by this even if we are members of the church.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3707.427s">Oh,</a> I... You were just gonna do the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=3711.09s">Yeah,</a> no, I was, well, I was just gonna say, like, I'm personally comfortable voting yes on it, but just to align with Councilor Lazzaro and keep consistency, I'm just gonna abstain.<h2><a href="../2025-01-20_XXXXXX00120/2025-01-20_XXXXXX00120.html">Matt Leming</a></h2>
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=48.557s">Hello,</a> my name's Matt Leming, he, him. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=52.039s">I</a> am a city councilor here in Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=55.861s">I've</a> been serving for about a little over a year now, and I'm pleased to be here.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=79.351s">Well,</a> I've eaten twice today at my usual place that I've mentioned twice before, which is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=85.735s">Oasis</a> Cafe just had chocolate chip pancakes for lunch, but I've been eating a little more lately at a Tom Young Koon Thai place in Medford Square. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=95.48s">So</a> that's a, it's just a nice place to sit down and get some Pad Thai.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=109.02s">You</a> got to have some place to eat before city council meetings. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=111.901s">So</a> that's pretty nearby.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=131.671s">Sure,</a> so yeah my personal time on city council at least pre November. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=137.338s">The</a> majority of that was spent on the override which was successful we've actually had a lot of other communities that have. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=145.033s">not</a> had successful overrides, reach out to our team and just ask how we did it and what the best way to execute an override campaign was. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=157.589s">But</a> we ended up succeeding by about <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=164.537s">5248</a> margins on questions seven and eight which would put question seven is going to put three million dollars to the medford public school system and five hundred thousand dollars to the department of public works and question eight put an additional four million dollars to the medford public school system for investment in uh <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=186.998s">different</a> programs there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=188.759s">The</a> school committee actually recently had a meeting earlier this week where they actually allocated the override funds. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=196.823s">And</a> it was one of the probably the only school committee meeting in recent memory that had anything to do with the budget that wasn't completely depressing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=205.287s">So</a> people actually got what they wanted out of that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=210.27s">But</a> I understand that Jenny, school committee vice chair Jenny Graham is going to appear on a future <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=217.193s">episode</a> of this and go into more detail breakdown of that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=219.675s">The</a> DPW commissioner also provided a breakdown of the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=227.867s">$500,000</a> that is going to his department. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=230.489s">We're</a> going to hire three permanent road repair crew members in order to get to work on patching up the roads and sidewalks within the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=243.038s">So</a> yeah, no, I'm very, I'm very proud of that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=246.06s">I'm</a> really proud of the campaign that we ran. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=250.743s">Obviously</a> question six failed. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=254.626s">Pretty</a> narrow, pretty narrow margin. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=256.786s">So,</a> but, you know, you can't have everything. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=260.768s">So</a> ever since then, we've been getting to work on a couple of other projects so this first council meeting was pretty exciting for me. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=272.501s">because</a> we got to see the passing of a couple of things that I'd really been working on for a while. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=280.666s">One</a> of them was a veteran housing program for veteran renters, where the city gives cash incentives to landlords who rent to qualified veterans, which can address some of the challenges that I've had with constituents who <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=299.818s">served</a> our country's military who have trouble finding housing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=304.521s">We</a> also passed a welcoming city ordinance, and this was something that we actually had to pass fairly quickly with the incoming Trump administration. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=316.849s">It</a> essentially codifies into the city's ordinance the pre-existing policy of the Medford Police Department, which <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=328.923s">says</a> that the MPD isn't obliged to cooperate with ICE or other federal authorities who <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=339.163s">want</a> to round up undocumented immigrants for non-criminal matters, and so that's just meant to be a protection to some of the residents of the city.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=376.707s">So</a> A little bit I would say the vast majority the vast majority were supportive and that is that's something to be proud of so the one that sticks out in my mind is actually there's a there's a resident who had recently moved here from Texas and she was a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=394.757s">physics</a> teacher over in Texas. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=397.298s">And</a> she would say that during the Trump administration, she had this experience where sometimes her friends would just go from their house to the store and then they would disappear on the way there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=408.723s">And</a> that was something that happened apparently pretty routinely in some states during the first Trump administration. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=416.726s">So</a> really just trying to do what we can to prevent a similar thing from happening. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=422.834s">that</a> we're going to be doing.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=428.096s">But,</a> uh, but, yeah, Yeah. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=429.377s">So</a> so this I mean, this past year in City Council has been. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=434.319s">Probably</a> one of the most. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=436.3s">Productive</a> that we've had in recent memory. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=439.521s">Um.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=440.862s">Just</a> a like, you know, I've had kind of a combination of some of my <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=452.987s">you</a> know there's always demands for greater transparency from your local government so city council started publishing just a very straightforward bullet point newsletter which residents can sign up for if they want to know exactly what city council has done over the past month. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=469.461s">We</a> passed a resolution to update the city's linkage fees to the state house which would hopefully get more money to the city for capital projects. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=481.631s">I've</a> started, you know, I got some YouTube account passwords and we started live streaming all the meetings to YouTube. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=488.913s">So</a> just really trying to get the city's finances in order and let residents know exactly what's going on. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=499.795s">Probably</a> the most important work that City Council is doing right now, a project that's been <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=509.618s">quite</a> a while in the making is our comprehensive zoning reform, which a lot of work really belongs to my colleagues for doing that because they spent previous terms allocating the funding in order to prepare for that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=523.205s">But</a> essentially what councils, well essentially Medford's <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=531.663s">zoning</a> hasn't been comprehensively updated for decades and the trouble with that is that you know the economy changes and zoning that we had from like the 60s isn't necessarily as applicable today as it is as it is today. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=548.071s">So</a> just for a little bit of a backing up, so zoning is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=556.79s">basically</a> when the city tells private property owners what they can or can't do or build with the property that they have. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=565.015s">So</a> in other words, if <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=567.765s">Somebody</a> purchased a plot of land in Medford, and they owned that land, and they couldn't just end up building a 60-story skyscraper right on that plot of land because that would be against the city's zoning. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=580.094s">So</a> they're not allowed to do that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=583.356s">It</a> does other things like it dictates what kinds of businesses can be opened by right, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=589.66s">or</a> what you have to get a special permit to do. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=592.843s">So</a> one very high profile instance that has kind of gone around social media was the opening of a Chase bank where Salvatore's used to be, which, you know, the people that own that storefront did that because they wanted to get out of the restaurant business is a little bit more risky. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=617.042s">And</a> they opened up a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=619.17s">a</a> Chase Bank there, which wasn't very popular with the residents, but they were able to do that because the city zoning said that they could open a bank by right there.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=652.288s">So</a> the, so for, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=658.141s">About</a> two years, Medford city government worked on something called the Medford Comprehensive Plan and people are always saying we want some kind of a vision for the future like what are we going to do with Medford in the long term and so <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=674.388s">They</a> spent two years collecting feedback from residents and business owners and other stakeholders to figure out what are our priorities for growing Medford? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=687.338s">What</a> do we want to do with it? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=690.521s">And</a> the three consistent pieces of feedback that sort of came out of the comprehensive plan were, one, we want Medford to be more business friendly. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=698.787s">So</a> the business community in Medford kind of was <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=704.345s">stagnant</a> for a while. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=705.845s">I've</a> heard people, countless people, who've tried to open a business in the city in previous years say that it's a very insular system. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=714.528s">It's</a> hard to come in as an outsider and understand all the workings of City Hall. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=720.209s">Another</a> thing that came out of the comprehensive plan was affordable housing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=725.152s">Part</a> of getting affordable housing is just building more housing in general, which is beneficial because it increases the city's tax base. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=734.325s">So</a> we're able to get more money if you have more residents. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=741.473s">obviously,</a> and also because for a lot of jobs like service workers, construction, you know, people who keep the city running in the day to day, they need somewhere to live. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=753.457s">So</a> you need to build more housing for them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=754.958s">So</a> that was the second point. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=757.259s">And</a> the third point that also came out of there was just really more pedestrian friendly areas in the city, like <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=766.623s">People</a> wanted Medford Square to be more walkable, the same thing with West Medford Square, Haines, South Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=774.851s">So</a> Medford published a comprehensive plan, and the next step is really executing that plan, so implementing it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=788.403s">And</a> the foundation for any sort of implementation is zoning so a big part of zoning is clarifying the city's permitting processes and really, and so if you have <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=802.838s">a</a> new person, they have some money, they want to open up a restaurant, they can look at the city zoning, figure out where they can actually open up the restaurant and understand very straightforwardly what permits they need to acquire in order to actually open that up. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=819.893s">And</a> so it kind of does away with this system where you have to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=824.957s">know</a> somebody or be friends with somebody in order to open up a business here and just really professionalizes and streamlines the process and so that's that's important. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=835.764s">The</a> other is creating <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=840.56s">incentives</a> for developers who want to build. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=850.162s">So</a> Medford is a very expensive community to live in. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=859.125s">Part</a> of addressing that is creating affordable housing, and part of that is building affordable housing units. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=869.14s">build</a> in order to incentivize developers to build affordable housing units you do need to make it profitable for them to do that and so there are a number of incentive structures that can be written into the zoning in order to help developers help incentivize developers to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=888.807s">you</a> know, create maybe 20 to 30% affordable housing units and any new complexes they create while giving them either like cash incentives or height incentives in the new zoning. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=903.118s">So</a> let's say that by right, a developer is able to build a three-story complex in some area, but you can also change the zoning to say that, okay, well, if you put in <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=917.188s">20%</a> affordable housing units will let you build up one or two stories more. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=920.932s">And</a> that's just one example of one of these incentive structures. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=928.358s">So</a> we have different incentive structures that we're building into there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=932.221s">One</a> of them is a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=933.342s">green</a> score which basically says that the more environmentally friendly you make your building like if you include solar panels or rooftop gardens on it then we'll let you build higher and another that I'm really pushing for is a transportation demand management incentive structure saying that okay if you make your <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=957.646s">you</a> know, if you do things to your building that can help decrease the reliance on, like decrease the amount of traffic that the building will bring in, then we'll let you do, then we'll let you build more stories there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=973.136s">So,</a> so yeah, it's, it's a very, it's a very technically complex process. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=980.06s">We're</a> working with, we're working with some, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=984.018s">Consultants</a> who've been great to go over this usually the planning and permitting committee meetings happen once every two weeks or so where residents can attend those. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=997.81s">I</a> would say <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1001.015s">Part</a> of the issue with zoning is that it does end up getting extremely complicated. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1006.077s">So</a> we are also working on ways to message it and clarify to residents exactly what's going on and how all of these changes will concretely affect them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1017.041s">So</a> at the last planning and permitting committee meeting, we passed a motion to work more closely with the mayor's office in making it so that <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1029.186s">uh</a> we would we essentially put more effort into uh community outreach and you know letting people know exactly how these changes wind up affecting them.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1057.408s">Yeah,</a> absolutely. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1059.429s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1060.07s">It'll</a> it will help. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1063.052s">It'll</a> help out small businesses, it'll help really clarify, it'll help, you know, organize where people can open up what it's really the basis for any kind of positive. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1079.722s">Let's</a> say infrastructural change that you have in the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1082.885s">So</a> you can't <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1084.23s">really</a> change a whole lot until you get the zoning right. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1088.591s">We</a> hear from residents all the time, you know, we're not satisfied with Medford Square, we're not satisfied with Salem Street, we want these to change, and that really starts out with zoning. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1101.375s">Another</a> thing about zoning that I feel like I need to clarify is it doesn't <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1106.777s">change</a> any current buildings. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1108.677s">So</a> we could change all of the zoning on Mystic Avenue. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1112.158s">And</a> in fact, that is the first sort of localized area of the city where we ended up passing zoning changes on it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1123.28s">But</a> it doesn't affect any buildings that are actually there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1127.081s">But</a> it does influence what developers can create in the future. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1133.054s">So</a> for instance, if we were to suddenly change the zoning in Medford Square to not allow any banks, then that wouldn't affect any banks that are actually there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1145.14s">So</a> that's just not how it works. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1146.901s">So</a> I feel like that's one part that needs to be clarified.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1158.222s">Yeah,</a> it helps future growth.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1172.318s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1172.918s">And</a> that is, yeah, the creation of affordable housing is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1179.839s">an</a> extremely difficult thing to get right. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1184.881s">The</a> Boston Globe Spotlight team did a really good series of articles in 2023 on just how it's basically not profitable for anybody to build any housing that's not like some luxury condominium just because labor has gotten more expensive. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1206.993s">There's</a> often local resistance to building, so it often takes time to get approvals for these new projects through. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1216.544s">Materials</a> are more expensive these days, so for instance, we can't just mandate that <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1225.998s">okay,</a> developers, our zoning says you need to build, you need to make all of your units affordable. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1232.561s">Like,</a> you need to make it so that it only requires a certain percentage of income from people who make immediate income in the area. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1239.945s">You</a> can't just say that because then they wouldn't build anything because it would be literally impossible for them to make a profit off of it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1248.149s">So</a> it's really a balancing act to do that, and yeah, it's, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1254.642s">It's</a> tricky to get right, but no, I have faith in our team that we'll be able to get something. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1260.169s">We'll</a> be able to get something good.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1286.631s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1288.552s">This,</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1290.154s">This</a> city cap part of the reason the city council so productive is because. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1293.895s">What</a> Medford was stagnant for a while, so it really gives us a lot of work to put on our desk I mean just just going back to the override. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1306.559s">We</a> if you look at. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1309.42s">The</a> 351 cities in Massachusetts, and I pulled out a spreadsheet and calculated this myself, 94% of them have had an override or a debt exclusion at some point in the past since the passing of Proposition 2.5 in 1980. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1326.895s">That's</a> because it's <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1332.752s">A,</a> it's mathematics. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1335.473s">Prop</a> 2 and 1 half doesn't allow city budgets to increase at a rate commensurate with inflation. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1341.555s">So</a> Medford never did that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1345.016s">So</a> our budget got behind. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1347.137s">And</a> this is one step in the right direction to help address our systemic budget issues. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1353.379s">And</a> you can see that pattern across a lot of the work that city council's done. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1361.032s">We</a> instituted general and capital stabilization funds. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1365.535s">We</a> were one of, I'd have to look it up, I think like something like between five and 10 cities that didn't have any sort of stabilization funds instituted. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1376.444s">And</a> this literally just lets us spend money more easily on capital projects. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1382.626s">You</a> know, when some like Somerville, they had an elementary school collapse. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1387.87s">Believe</a> last year, and the emergency repairs funds for that came from one of their stabilization funds. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1395.016s">Again,</a> Medford only had that as of last year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1398.638s">So</a> there's there's just really a lot of work that city council's doing and catching us up and creating some of the. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1407.245s">very</a> basic instruments of municipal governments that other cities have previously taken for granted.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1433.652s">Yeah,</a> it really was a long time ago. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1437.033s">So</a> I <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1439.128s">Well,</a> I was involved in the Medford Charter Review Coalition for a while too. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1445.334s">So</a> I was one of those nerds who was trying to mail out signature sheets to people to get them to get their name for society so that we can get some form of charter review on the ballot, which that particular avenue never succeeded, but it did incentivize the mayor to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1465.27s">create</a> the Charter Study Committee, which you served on, I believe, for the whole time, and I served on for the first few months, of course, before I had to step down to start a city council campaign. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1477.898s">So,</a> backing up a little bit, I believe you have had Milva on the show to go over this, but <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1488.148s">The</a> city charter of Medford is kind of it's kind of like the Constitution of the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1494.283s">So</a> it's, it's interesting because <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1498.645s">City</a> council can change the ordinances of the city, but the charter of the city actually has to be, can only be changed at the state level because it, uh, it dictates things like, do we have, you know, a strong or weak mayor system of government? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1515.719s">How</a> many city Councilors do we have? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1517.701s">What</a> is the composition of our school committee? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1519.722s">Uh,</a> and stuff like that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1522.204s">And</a> the city charter previously was, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1526.353s">very</a> old document, it wasn't incredibly well written. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1530.655s">And</a> so there was a demand to have some form of charter review in 2022, which failed at the state house, and then the Charter Study Committee was created by the mayor. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1547.101s">And</a> so y'all have been at work for <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1550.95s">I</a> believe it was like one or two years. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1553.631s">Yeah,</a> just creating a new draft of a city charter. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1560.293s">So</a> those only, those got passed the city council in December, this past December, I believe. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1568.396s">So</a> they were submitted to the mayor, the mayor submitted to city council. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1573.437s">And</a> what's gonna happen with that now is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1577.471s">City</a> Council is going to review it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1579.633s">It's</a> in the Governance Committee at the moment, where City Council is going to make our own changes to it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1588.28s">Then</a> City Council will then pass that to the State House in the form of a Home Rule petition. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1596.332s">I</a> actually spoke with the chair of the governance committee just to clarify exactly what the process was, because it is a bit confusing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1601.673s">But</a> essentially, it goes to the state house. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1604.554s">The</a> state house will decide to approve it or not approve it, depending on whatever the decision is. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1613.356s">And</a> supposing they do approve it, it will then go on the ballot <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1620.162s">This</a> coming November, although that really depends on sort of the different timelines that we see, but it'll go on the ballot at some point. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1628.37s">People</a> of Medford will vote on whether or not to change the charter, and then it goes to the State House again, I believe, for official ratification. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1641.019s">So</a> yeah, so the proposed, I'd say like the most significant proposed changes to the charter are term limits for the mayor as well as increasing the mayor's term from two years to four years. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1654.216s">So</a> that's one that the study committee recommended. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1659.442s">The</a> other was a ward representation for city council. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1663.184s">So</a> right now all city councilors in Medford are at large. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1667.847s">Most</a> do a hybrid system of some at large in which all people in Medford vote on them and some ward based. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1675.991s">And</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1678.415s">also</a> changing of the composition of the school committee to be that hybrid system as well. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1684.883s">So</a> those are, I believe, going to begin to be discussed in more detail in the governance committee next week. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1694.295s">So</a> yeah, it's all pretty exciting. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1695.797s">I</a> mean, I've <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1697.058s">I've</a> spoken with residents of Medford who've come up to me and said, like, we've been, you know, we've lived here all our lives and we've just been waiting for so long to see any sort of substance of change happen in this city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1709.728s">And</a> so a lot of it is happening. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1711.209s">A</a> lot of it is happening all at once now.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1729.574s">Not</a> as much as you'd think. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1731.875s">So</a> open meeting law prevents us from discussing it amongst ourselves. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1742.214s">in</a> too much detail. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1743.935s">So</a> the communication there is like, I will have conversations one-on-one with Councilors on certain topics of different things we're discussing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1760.643s">That's</a> usually necessary, for instance, if you want to get a co-sponsor. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1763.424s">You</a> have to have it in depth with one, sometimes two of your colleagues. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1769.858s">or</a> if we are like meeting outside of an open meeting, then we just do not discuss council business or stuff that might appear on the council agenda. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1782.918s">So</a> I don't know. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1786.21s">how</a> other councillors are feeling. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1790.493s">I</a> believe one of my colleagues actually just a few hours before this call did release some of his proposed changes to the current draft of the charter, and those will be discussed at a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1807.306s">this</a> Tuesday's governance committee meeting, but we'd have to actually wait to the meeting to see what everybody thinks of those.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1825.943s">Yeah,</a> well, yeah, one, I mean, one project that I that I've really enjoyed working on personally is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1833.772s">And</a> I believe this will come up in Jenny's podcast episode as well. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1840.615s">I've</a> been working with a group of parents who are the parents of youth with disabilities, and they are basically just looking to have more support for their kids in the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1856.763s">I</a> think the lack of after-school programs has always been a hot topic in Medford, often, which the school committee has had to address that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1868.771s">But</a> this group in particular has had a particular lack of support for the kids. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1873.654s">They've</a> often had to go drive outside of town just to find any programs that would support children who are on the spectrum or children with Down syndrome, so on and so forth. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1886.502s">And</a> so at this most recent council meeting, we basically gave them a platform to talk about their experiences with this, their previous frustrations in lobbying local elected officials to do anything about it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1905.742s">And</a> I spent a lot of time sort of talking to different staff around City Hall, the library, DEI office to figure out, OK, well, what can we specifically do to help support the programs? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1921.089s">And</a> we did end up endorsing a motion to encourage the city to hire a therapeutic recreation specialist and an office manager in Medford Recreation, which <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1934.618s">We</a> will, we'll see how that will see how that goes during the budget season that actually can't come out of override funds and come out of this because it is outside the school system technically. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1945.072s">But</a> once, but you know. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1949.878s">if</a> and when we do get funding for that during the budget season, which I am hoping we can get an allocation for that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1956.563s">And</a> then I look forward to supporting the development of those programs and hopefully partnering with outside cities to make sure they're well attended. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1965.81s">So</a> yeah, I am pleased with that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1974.076s">And</a> also just really excited about getting <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1979.843s">Continuing</a> with the rezoning process, so we have, the way we're doing it is kind of neighborhood by neighborhood. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1988.946s">So</a> we've proposed some zoning changes for Mystic Avenue, which people have been demanding for a very long time, and Salem Street as well. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=1999.05s">And</a> we have a schedule where we're going to get to rezoning the neighborhoods and West Medford, South Medford, Medford Square, and so on. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=2011.084s">So</a> yeah, that's probably some of the most important work that we're doing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=2017.815s">Yeah,</a> no, I'm really proud of what this council has done. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=2020.197s">I</a> mean, it is, just objectively speaking, the most productive city council that this city has seen in, well, any recent memory.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=2041.105s">Yeah,</a> no, and thank you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=2043.046s">Thank</a> you for for having me on and just, you know, giving me the platform to let let folks know, let folks know what's happening.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=2059.351s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=2059.791s">So</a> in response to the demands for transparency, which, you know, we do we do here, we do hear about quite a bit, we've probably ended up putting out <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=2071.545s">A</a> little too much media out there so every so we have the city council newsletter, which is more of a, which is something that the city council or the resident services and public engagement committee votes to publish. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=2084.312s">And</a> that's just a very factual breakdown of the things that we're doing over the past month as well as links to YouTube videos and there's links to sign up for that list in. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=2094.497s">every</a> copy of the city council newsletter it can be found on the city council web page so just google medford ma city council and look under the newsletter section most elected officials have their own websites and their own some have their own blogs as well so i've been <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=2117.277s">I've</a> been pretty consistent about sending out bi-weekly updates to residents, as well as a blog post, which you can find on my website, mattLeming.com, if you're interested. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=2130.934s">And</a> I just like to publish, you know, just <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=2134.559s">different</a> blog posts on just different topics that City Council is working on. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=2139.821s">So</a> the most recent one was just a breakdown of what's happening with the welcoming city ordinance, but I also will routinely release either just <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/34X140IyPD8ZqDDHlBgYU7?t=2151.905s">uh</a> some breakdown of some whichever bills that i'm uh talking about at the moment or if there's not much going on that month then just some more general thoughts about happenings in the city hey we'll look out for those and um i can put some of those links in the show notes for folks but yeah but good luck with everything um and yeah i guess keep up the good work yeah thank you thank you very much uh danielle and have a have a wonderful weekend<h2><a href="../2025-01-19_rhbZru6Xl4Y/2025-01-19_rhbZru6Xl4Y.html">UU Medford Sermon - "Community and Isolation"</a></h2>
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=40.682s">I'm</a> going to go on to the sermon. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=41.983s">I</a> understand that a lot of the sermons at UU lately have gotten kind of... Yeah, we've been having audio issues all morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=53.932s">A</a> lot of the sermons at UU lately have gotten political. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=60.056s">I'm</a> a local politician, so it's not going to get any better. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=64.159s">Sorry</a> about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=65.2s">Hopefully</a> we can get off this topic eventually. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=70.973s">Hello.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=71.833s">Just</a> to introduce myself again, my name's Matt Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=75.675s">I've</a> been a member of this congregation since 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=79.597s">I'm</a> a researcher at Mass General, a reservist, and I serve on the City Council of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=86.541s">I</a> was asked to do a sermon here a few months ago, and I thought for a long time about what I should talk about. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=95.025s">And</a> I figured that I should talk about something that I think about a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=101.459s">In</a> the past year that I've been on City Council, there are a few topics that I keep meditating on. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=107.205s">Income</a> inequality was pretty embedded in a political campaign recently in which people voted to raise their own property taxes to prevent mass layoffs on the Medford public school system and invest in maintaining our infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=128.057s">An</a> older woman in this congregation <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=137.98s">increases,</a> even though she was on a very limited fixed income, because she knew it was the right thing to do for the next generation. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=146.005s">Another</a> thing I think about is land use, housing, where people can live. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=152.79s">City</a> Council is working on a historic rezoning initiative at the moment, which is foundational for any new growth, building, and commerce in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=162.876s">And</a> I think about the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=167.017s">Last</a> week, we passed an ordinance to make Medford into a sanctuary city to protect undocumented immigrants from the incoming administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=179.063s">And</a> all of that is very important work that I'm proud of, but it's also a bit dry and impersonal and good policy probably isn't what everyone is thinking about at the moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=196.932s">about</a> my job is people. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=199.336s">So</a> I'm going to talk about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=201.459s">Being</a> in elected office, especially at the local level, people come to me with all their hopes and all their frustrations. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=210.572s">And</a> it's a literal impossibility to please everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=215.875s">I</a> learned that early on. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=218.416s">Medford</a> is a community of both long-time homeowners and renters, of multi-generational residents and relative newcomers, of the elderly and those with new families and those who just came here for a job in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=231.763s">Geographically,</a> it's placed between blue-collar communities, historically black neighborhoods, renter-heavy areas in South Medford, <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=240.618s">and</a> some of the more high-class suburbs in the north. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=245.719s">Historically,</a> the Medford City Council was a pretty stagnant body, and I think I was elected in part because a majority of the city was frustrated with this and wanted change. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=258.583s">And</a> the vast majority of the people are very supportive of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=263.417s">Older</a> residents have been waiting decades to see it, and younger residents just like to see positive investments in their future. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=272.166s">And</a> other residents come to me with legitimate complaints, which we can have a productive two-way dialogue about. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=279.518s">But</a> many others wouldn't be satisfied with any particular action, and they're not satisfied with inaction, either. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=292.003s">There's</a> nothing I can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=295.144s">Some</a> of them just want to feel heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=297.645s">There's</a> some who are scared, some who are rabble-rousers, and I sat through my share of six-hour city council meetings <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=309.454s">At</a> some level, it's healthiest for a person in my position to just ignore that and do what the majority of voters voted me in to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=318.737s">And</a> I tried. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=320.857s">But</a> I can't ignore it completely, because I do have some level of sympathy for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=327.099s">And</a> at the most practical level, I can't ignore the fact that this is not an effort-specific issue.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=334.702s">And</a> our country just reelected an autocrat who will be taking office tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=339.807s">So,</a> I think it represents a bigger issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=345.935s">During</a> the tax override campaign, I spoke with a political activist who was more experienced than me and gave me his thoughts on these chronic naysayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=355.683s">His</a> interpretation was that they were mostly people who were lonely. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=360.625s">They</a> have a lot of time to post to the internet, and they don't have much going on, so they spend their days complaining about politics. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=369.87s">In</a> high school, I read a book by the psychologist Carl Jung called Man and His Symbols. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=379.014s">In</a> it, Jung said that people have an innate need for <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=386.553s">He</a> talked about the mind requiring a sense of importance, just as our bodies need air or water. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=395.862s">Some</a> people feel important through their occupation. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=399.565s">Some</a> people feel important by supporting their friends and their community. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=404.63s">Some</a> feel their importance through expertise on a particular topic, and some feel important by being good parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=415.207s">of</a> importance from something real, we'll seek it elsewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=419.149s">He</a> told a story in the book of a woman who had been abused and belittled by her husband for years and years before she had a complete mental breakdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=431.496s">This</a> woman was committed to a mental hospital, and in the hospital she woke up every morning and said that she had just had a baby. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=439.62s">Having</a> a child, Youngstead does offer a sense of importance <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=445.537s">This</a> woman was made to feel so insignificant that eventually she got her sense of importance from delusions. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=454.191s">Thought</a> about that story a lot over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=458.255s">The</a> last eight years, just like everyone else, I've been thinking about why Trump was elected in the first place. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=465.837s">And</a> anytime I think about it, my mind naturally goes back to something that my mother told me back in 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=474.0s">She</a> said, Matt, most people go to work, go home, listen to the radio, go to sleep, and that's their lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=480.542s">At</a> some point, you just want to throw a brick through the window. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=484.263s">Historically,</a> people got their sense of importance through their community. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=489.067s">When</a> you're in a community, you have influence, you have support, and this was often found through unions, rotary clubs, Masonic lodges, churches, and so on, all of which have had steadily declining memberships for decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=504.515s">Today,</a> many, many people in the United States and the world feel isolated. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=509.638s">Even</a> before the COVID-19 pandemic, a report from the Surgeon General said that about half of U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=516.042s">adults</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=517.138s">reported</a> measurable levels of loneliness. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=520.54s">One-person</a> households have risen by 15% in the United States over the past 60 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=527.003s">And</a> back then, while 44% of people reported having dinner with their neighbors a few times a month, only 28% reported this in 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=537.24s">Unions</a> used to provide a social fabric for blue-collar and rural communities, and union membership peaked in the United States in the 1940s and 50s before it saw a slow, decades-long decline. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=551.523s">In</a> 1983, when I assume they first started to record these statistics, 20% of U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=556.624s">workers</a> were in a union, while only 10% were in in 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=566.172s">As</a> community declines and individuals become increasingly isolated, many achieve their own sense of importance through outbursts, through anger, through conspiracy theories, ideas that make them believe they're the one with the real answers to life's problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=582.522s">And</a> it's very easy for bad actors to take advantage of this mindset, so we need to fight that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=599.506s">Been,</a> uh, delayed with the audio all morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=605.45s">During</a> the, uh, tax overrun campaign that succeeded this past November, I helped coordinate a number of parents who wanted to see their children have better schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=614.856s">I</a> helped train them to talk to their neighbors, going door-to-door to meet others, and explain why these investments are so desperately needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=622.541s">But</a> I also saw the effects of, uh, disinformation <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=628.188s">A</a> small group of developers and people with millions of dollars of property that they didn't want to pay more on. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=634.871s">And</a> older politicians who just don't like to see power mounted in this information campaign. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=640.393s">And</a> these weren't the people on a fixed income who I have a lot of sympathy for, but they did pretend to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=647.556s">And</a> this information had an effect on citing anger and division on the basis of nothing more than fabrications, <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=657.75s">But</a> because of those parents who knocked on doors and contributed their time and effort, who talked in person to their neighbors, the measures passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=668.121s">This</a> isn't isolated to Medford, Asheville, North Carolina, the city where I lived and attended high school for six years. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=675.269s">I</a> was recently devastated by a hurricane. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=679.052s">Dozens</a> lost their lives and whole areas of the city were destroyed by flooding. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=683.193s">My</a> best friend's dad was nearly impaled by a tree that went through his living room wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=687.994s">But</a> when FEMA tried to send in aid workers, they were attacked by a few residents who had been told that these aid workers were part of a vast governmental conspiracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=700.595s">On</a> a personal level, I have nothing but empathy for people who feel isolated, outside, left behind, angry, lost, or just want someone to talk to. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=710.904s">Growing</a> up, I was a military brat, and I attended 13 schools in Virginia, California, Washington State, North Carolina. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=718.61s">I</a> don't think that I was mentally equipped at that age to be uprooted that often. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=725.036s">I</a> was the outsider. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=730.927s">It</a> doesn't feel good to be lonely, and being lonely makes one feel unimportant, and that can make a person act out. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=739.511s">It</a> was only later, through trial and error, that I learned how to build a community in new places and make friends, and that's why I value it so much today. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=750.875s">When</a> I first came to Medford, I didn't expect to stay for long with the economic situation my generation and coming generations face, we're always incentivized to uproot ourselves and move on, especially in a place as expensive as greater Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=767.005s">I</a> became involved largely through this church in affordable housing work around Medford, and I learned just how many residents here wanted to make things better. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=778.164s">This</a> work brought me and a few other activists around to lobby the city council on affordable housing initiatives, and I quickly learned that while politicians can rarely make change happen by themselves, they can easily block it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=794.841s">So</a> you do need good elected representatives sitting in those seats. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=799.786s">Often,</a> good people, even if they do have the time, energy, capacity, and mindset to run, are too busy doing other good things to run for public office, and that leaves a vacuum for the not-so-good people. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=815.281s">So,</a> even as a relative newcomer with very little money in the bank, I decided to try it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=822.697s">Since</a> that wrote, most of my job has been to battle the effects of misinformation. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=831.04s">As</a> a scientist, I try to reason with people who disagree with me, but what I've come to realize is that facts, logic, and data are not nearly as important for this as in-person social networks <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=845.889s">Most</a> people form their views based on community, what their neighbors think, or these days, what they've read on whatever community they've been directed to on the internet. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=857.874s">For</a> all its historic problems in America, it used to be more social. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=861.536s">And</a> I don't want to make the mistake of looking at the past with rose-colored glasses. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=868.379s">We're</a> reminded tomorrow, in LK Day, that things used to be a lot worse for a lot of people than they are today. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=879.403s">is</a> verifiably true. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=881.865s">And</a> without this regular interaction, people can become isolated and vulnerable and easily taken advantage of by bad actors. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=892.971s">If</a> I had one critique of my generation, it's that we're a bit too picky about what we choose to be involved with. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=900.696s">We're</a> mistrustful of organizations in general these days. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=908.108s">And</a> I could be preaching to the choir here, telling this to the Unitarian Church, but don't be afraid to put your time into an organization, a church, volunteer group, social club, anything outside of work or the internet, even if it's imperfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=925.781s">And</a> if your neighbors are lonely or left out, bring them into the fold. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=930.844s">They</a> might accept the invitation, or they might not invite them. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=937.589s">America</a> is sharply divided right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=940.13s">The</a> next four years are not going to be a cakewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=943.751s">Everyone</a> can do their part. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=945.751s">Political</a> activism, volunteering for an organization, or just talking to a neighbor if you need someone to talk to. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=952.993s">Tomorrow,</a> January 20th, will be the four-year, two-week anniversary of an insurrection in the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=960.015s">Capitol.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=960.476s">And</a> what I like about it is, Justice Peter is the very man who incited that insurrection. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=966.617s">But</a> it will also celebrate the 96th year since the birth of the most important civil rights leader. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=975.22s">And</a> I'll conclude with a quote of his that I think fits this occasion. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=981.202s">The</a> line of progress is never straight. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=984.623s">For</a> a period, a movement may follow a straight line and encounters obstacles and paths bends. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=990.425s">It's</a> like curving around a mountain when you're approaching a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=995.497s">Often</a> it feels as though you're moving backwards and you lose sight of your goal, but in fact you are moving ahead, and soon you will see the city again closer by. <a href="https://youtu.be/rhbZru6Xl4Y&t=1004.663s">Thank</a> you for listening.<h2><a href="../2025-01-15_7W6Pc0j59SY/2025-01-15_7W6Pc0j59SY.html">City Council Planning and Permitting Committee 01-15-25</a></h2>
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3569.457s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3570.057s">Just</a> for some, Council President Bears, just for some clarification, so you mentioned, I believe part of that motion was, for instance, making all NR2 into NR1. <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3583.724s">Just</a> to clarify, is that a, I mean, would that mean that all of the current NR1s get updated to include two-unit dwellings and historical conversion of two to three units, or would that mean that all <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3601.829s">And</a> our twos get that requirement for two-unit dwellings removed.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3637.724s">Well,</a> I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3641.113s">Sorry.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3796.491s">I</a> don't know if I could support President Bears's motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3800.514s">I</a> mean, I think you do need additional density, particularly around the T stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3811.483s">I</a> mean, I personally don't see the need to sort of increase the <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3820.359s">the</a> amounts of single unit dwellings quite that much. <a href="https://youtu.be/7W6Pc0j59SY&t=3827.528s">So</a> yeah, I personally like it as it is.<h2><a href="../2025-01-14_zZxqrgNcAQo/2025-01-14_zZxqrgNcAQo.html">City Council 01-14-25</a></h2>
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1781.445s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1783.346s">So</a> I'm a data scientist by trade. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1786.649s">And</a> whenever I communicate with residents and add an email, I usually like to run some numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1792.774s">I</a> often look at historical housing prices and things like that that come from the state data bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1802.241s">And</a> whenever I try to bring any of that data <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1807.52s">Whenever</a> I try to bring my eye over to the city, it's always a bit of a challenge. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1811.443s">If</a> you go on the elections website, for instance, they do release historic elections data, but it's all in kind of PDFs. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1819.728s">It's</a> occasionally a Google spreadsheet. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1821.75s">It's</a> all very inconsistent. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1823.011s">If</a> I try to look at historical data from the assessor's office, it is all available. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1829.615s">In</a> a website if you want to look up a particular address, but if you want to do bulk analysis of the trends find the average price find the average assessed price of a certain neighborhood, for instance, that state is very difficult to come by, even though it is available within the assessor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1845.307s">So</a> this is a way to inform discussions among residents as well as department heads and city staff when they're making these sort of decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1854.654s">It's</a> a way to make all of our decisions a lot more numbers driven by making data from different apartments accessible in a format that is easiest to analyze. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1865.302s">So</a> I'm personally very excited about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1867.744s">I'm</a> very excited to get into the weeds about this in committee and <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1874.128s">I</a> look forward to the discussion in the coming months about it.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1964.836s">Thank</a> you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1969.322s">Before</a> I was in public office and about six months after, I was a mentor for a very wonderful charity called Partners for Youth with Disabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1978.306s">It's</a> basically like a big brother, big sister kind of a program, except it's for youth who have a number of disabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1985.989s">I</a> was working with a kid in Somerville who was on the spectrum, and it was also something that I studied a little bit more abstractly in grad school. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=1996.733s">Working</a> with him, we met up usually once a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2002.037s">I</a> understood the challenges that not only these kids go through, but also their parents, as well as the amount of extra support that kids with disabilities need. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2015.308s">And</a> very recently, Councilor Callahan and I, as well as you, Council President Bears, were approached by a group of parents of <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2027.291s">kids</a> and teenagers with disabilities who had been advocating for years for more city support for their kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2035.517s">Oftentimes</a> they just wanted to have a group that would let them meet up after school to play board games, or really do any kind of <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2045.884s">socialization</a> to get them out of the house, any kind of support. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2050.187s">And</a> so the purpose of this resolution is to first give these parents, a number of whom are here tonight to speak about their experience, to give them a platform to talk and make public some of the challenges they've been through over the years, and also to prioritize some staff support <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2075.644s">for</a> their kids during budget season. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2078.806s">It</a> could come through increased support to the Medford Recreation Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2083.248s">It</a> could come through other positions, but I'll stop talking because I'm looking forward to what they have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2091.371s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=2092.432s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Leming.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4003.663s">So,</a> so I do I do agree with the idea of having an additional motion but there's a. So I've been talking to a lot of different city staff about where the appropriate budget request would be initially it was a part time position under Francis office, I spoke to Kevin Bailey I think that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4021.957s">The</a> most concrete ask would probably be a therapeutic recreation specialist, as well as an office manager under the recreation department, which would give them enough staff to be able to support these programs and likely integrate into that collaborations with other towns surrounding cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4047.662s">It</a> could also come in the form of <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4051.494s">something</a> this would cost the city less, but I think we should have more staff in the Recreation Department in addition to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4058.137s">A</a> community development block grant fund with a non-profit like Communitas. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4064.64s">Patricia</a> was partnering up with her church in order to find a space for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4070.963s">Partnership</a> with an organization such as that would also be another concrete ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4076.646s">I</a> would make the motion to <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4081.868s">request</a> for the budget season additional staffing under Medford Recreation or another department that could support this kind of programming for the upcoming budget season. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4097.935s">So</a> preferably under Medford Recreation, but if there is flexibility there and it would be more appropriate to be in another department, that could fulfill that motion.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4146.344s">That's</a> that's not really in the I mean, that's a separate process. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=4149.346s">Yeah,</a> that's that's kind of a separate process.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5262.606s">I</a> would just like to thank all of the advocates and all of the people who had lengthy discussions about this in the preceding months and years. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5276.181s">As</a> is often the case, it's us sitting here on City Council that are <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5281.706s">passing</a> these ordinances, but it's really the residents of the city who make, lend us their expertise, make their voices heard, and convince us to support policies that make Medford as welcoming a city as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5299.799s">It's</a> really them that deserve the credit for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5303.121s">I</a> think this is a <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5304.625s">an</a> appropriate measure to pass given that we're going to see a change in administration in about a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5314.274s">So</a> I'm very proud of all the work that went into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5317.957s">And</a> I'd just like to thank the folks who are here today, particularly from Medford People Power and the ACLU who helped us out on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5325.343s">So</a> thank you very much.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5556.299s">Yes,</a> I sent an email to both the chief of police as well as the school committee requesting feedback on the draft of the welcoming city ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5569.069s">I</a> invited the chief of police to come to the relevant committee meetings where we were going over this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5575.714s">Didn't</a> hear back. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5576.374s">I</a> heard back from a couple of members of the school committee and incorporated their feedback into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5581.898s">So</a> yeah.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=5583.86s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=7125.435s">I'd</a> like to thank everybody who spoke out about the ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=7130.398s">Just</a> one small point to address. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=7132.479s">So</a> even if something like this were to affect federal funding, I would be fully in support of it anyway, because that doesn't factor into my calculus. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=7145.966s">But</a> you do need to consider that we've already been through one Trump administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=7154.801s">PolitiFact,</a> it does state that while he did issue executive order attempting to cut funding to sanctuary cities, to welcoming cities, those actually largely failed. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=7165.145s">I</a> mean, they were held back by courts. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=7169.286s">Most</a> of those ended up being struck down in court. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=7172.007s">So</a> maybe it will succeed the next time, but it actually didn't succeed the first time. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=7178.49s">It</a> was just well-publicized. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=7180.21s">So</a> that's the only point I want to make about that.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=7994.192s">Thank</a> you, Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=7995.693s">So</a> this is something that was originally introduced in May. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=7999.594s">And</a> it was an idea of the veteran services director, Veronica Shaw. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8004.756s">So</a> I know that it's often beneficial for folks on city council to take credit for this, but really the credit for the idea and all the work for this goes to both Mrs. Shaw, as well as the very supportive staff at <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8024.063s">housing</a> families who've agreed to initiate a pilot program around this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8028.646s">Essentially,</a> the Veteran Services Office has a small amount of discretionary funds, which Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8035.57s">Shaw</a> wanted to use as an incentive to landlords who choose to rent to veteran renters, which would help with some of the discrimination often faced by this country's veterans in attempting to find <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8051.82s">housing.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8053.161s">So</a> this a lot of the legwork behind this was informing that partnership with housing families. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8060.024s">The</a> amendment that we see here in, uh, in the city's ordinances, section 2765 housing incentives did come after very lengthy discussion with legal. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8075.551s">Basically,</a> the wording of it is to keep in is <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8081.155s">to</a> keep in line with the fact that one, the city can't just give money directly to individual citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8086.999s">We</a> need to partner with a nonprofit and the under state law, the only individual in the city who has the right to create a contract with a nonprofit is the city's mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8100.668s">So</a> the wording of this is a little bit wonky, but it basically says that the, <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8107.493s">mayor</a> in collaboration with the veteran services director can form a partnership with one of these nonprofits and that the funding would come from the veteran services office for this for this particular program. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8120.725s">So</a> I'm very excited about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8123.347s">There's</a> a lot of work that is <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8125.889s">already</a> gone into forming this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/zZxqrgNcAQo&t=8129.933s">And</a> because I basically see this as a very minor amendment to the duties of the city's ordinances of the veteran services director, I would motion to waive all three readings and pass this directly.<h2><a href="../2025-01-15_F41aZM7C-XA/2025-01-15_F41aZM7C-XA.html">City Council Committee of the Whole 01-14-25</a></h2>
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F41aZM7C-XA&t=2528.116s">Would</a> the motion be to send it to regular meeting then?

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1379.187s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1381.408s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1382.924s">Right</a> now, they're the two moving parts that are first the homeworld petition going into the State House, which. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1394.304s">I</a> believe they should be hopefully submitted when they convene. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1399.289s">And</a> then if it gets approved, it will allow the city to do those regular updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1404.995s">The</a> other part of that is we were advised by the planning department that <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1415.752s">It</a> would be best to finish the affordable housing nexus studies before we went forward with actually updating leakage fee ordinance to include a direct link to the affordable housing trust and as I explained there are some <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1431.546s">legal</a> reasons behind that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1432.847s">So</a> if the ordinance were passed before there was a study justifying it, then it could be struck down in court. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1441.033s">So</a> the draft language for that is all finished. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1445.676s">It's</a> all completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1447.257s">I've</a> been corresponding with the mayor and she's getting the money <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1453.341s">she's</a> told me to actually fund this $80,000 Nexus study to put money from the Capital Improvements Program into the Affordable Housing Trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1463.324s">And</a> then once that's underway, we could just officially pass the edits, which again, have already been discussed extensively in committee.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1576.441s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1577.201s">So</a> that whole project kind of split off into two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1581.782s">So</a> a couple of the things that I was working on initially ended up kind of being papers that I submitted to Inns Associates for the planning process. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1593.803s">The</a> commercial vacancy tax, um, I think it became clear during the 1 meeting that we had on it that it would require. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1602.986s">probably</a> meeting a few more meetings with building department and other parties to planning department to figure out the future of that, but I also submitted a request to the planning folks to include a building vacancy <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1626.042s">uh,</a> tax, which is a building vacancy, I would say a fee, which is something that has been implemented in other cities without the need for a home rule petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1635.885s">And</a> it's not quite the level of a tax, but that's kind of like the other manifestation of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=1641.286s">Um,</a> it would just come up later in the zoning process.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4404.321s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4404.761s">We</a> have a residence guide in English. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4408.264s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Tseng, for making that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4410.806s">It</a> needs to be made multilingual. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4413.849s">We'll</a> do that later. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4415.79s">Modernizing</a> city council communications has really been the major project of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4420.76s">Um,</a> we have basically every meeting we draft a newsletter, send it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4424.723s">We</a> also have YouTube streaming, which is pretty cool. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4427.565s">I'd</a> like to thank all my colleagues for creating the listening sessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4432.89s">So</a> far we've had three with the Arab community, the Portuguese speaking community and seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4438.374s">Um,</a> it was found in practice that these were kind of difficult to like, it was difficult to like organize all of these in, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4448.541s">Um.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4448.621s">Practice</a> and kind of like a one off fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4450.761s">So</a> we're going to continue to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4452.102s">But</a> Councilor Lazzaro and I have also decided to start scheduling regular listening sessions at the senior center. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4459.023s">Uh,</a> next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4460.484s">Um,</a> we. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4463.864s">Past</a> a and also, um, like to thank Councilor Cal and for work on the upcoming listening session at the West <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4475.845s">Harmon</a> Zuckerman, PB – He, Him, His): Have a welcoming ordinance like to thank Councilor Tseng for introducing that last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4481.187s">Sorry</a> for all the jumping around that you're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4482.907s">I</a> just kind of made a text list so that I can do this quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4485.508s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4486.268s">Harmon</a> Zuckerman, PB – He, Him, His.: <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4488.009s">:</a> A welcoming ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4489.369s">Harmon</a> Zuckerman, PB – He, Him, His.: <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4490.35s">:</a> Which was passed for first reading last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4495.085s">And</a> hopefully will be passed for a third reading on January 14. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4502.033s">I</a> don't know if this was in there, but if this is in the governing agenda, because it was kind of put on there as an ad hoc thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4512.751s">as</a> a result of the veteran services director efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4515.933s">But</a> we're working right now on a veteran veteran rental assistant program, which is set to be discussed in council on the 14th and hopefully passed for a first reading them. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4527.661s">But</a> I still have to submit that paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4529.202s">Um,</a> Councilor Callahan and I, this is another one that's not on the agenda, but these things kind of crop up are also working with some, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4538.71s">uh,</a> mothers of kids with disabilities, uh, to, uh, create after school programs for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4546.497s">Uh,</a> there, a lot of the stuff mentioned here is some of the commission, uh, work that Councilor Tseng is working on. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4553.403s">I</a> know that there are, uh, he's doing a lot of behind the scenes work on a human rights commission ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4559.608s">Um,</a> I don't, I'm not always a hundred percent aware, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4564.759s">what</a> is going on behind the scenes. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4566.9s">Some</a> of these were introduced before I was on council, but whenever he does have progress, I make sure to make time in the committee so that we can move on those. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4579.004s">I</a> know that the, I believe that the data policies that are mentioned there haven't been worked on, worked on a whole lot, but that could be something that we start on the next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4593.542s">And</a> that is all that I have.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4764.117s">Motion</a> to adjourn. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4766.178s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4766.358s">Withdrawn.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DqMvnghi1-4&t=4900.228s">Yes.</a> <h2><a href="../2024-12-18_iw3k1TZ1ejU/2024-12-18_iw3k1TZ1ejU.html">City Council 12-17-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1109.734s">I</a> find the records in order and move to approve.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1315.551s">Thank</a> you, Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1317.232s">At</a> the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee, we discussed and heard public comments in favor of the Welcoming City Ordinance, which we are discussing tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=1328.536s">We</a> also drafted a newsletter and briefly discussed some scheduling of the City Council's upcoming listening sessions.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7338.585s">Yes,</a> thank you, Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7340.887s">So</a> I didn't do this earlier because I wanted to hear what the folks from the DBW in the room had to say during public comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7351.953s">And</a> it is a point that I have a lot of sympathy with considering that I work a job where I get <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7358.426s">uh,</a> urinalysis testing in front of my colleagues at least three times a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7362.668s">So,</a> um, but there are, there are, uh, other issues with this resolution that I have mainly OML considerations, which has been discussed in this council before. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7374.173s">And</a> I want more information about the private investigator issue, uh, as well as, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7382.998s">the</a> fact that I'm not sure about the city council stepping into strictly school committee issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7388.843s">So</a> I'm going to go and invoke rule 21 on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7390.845s">We</a> can move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7392.266s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7589.744s">No,</a> I'm keeping, I'm keeping my rule 21 invocation. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=7593.687s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=8700.479s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12827.95s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12828.27s">I'm</a> just going to share my screen really quickly to this Google document that I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12834.656s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12836.497s">Can</a> everybody see that? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12840.841s">Hello?</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12843.143s">All</a> right, great. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12844.837s">So</a> we went over the text of this in the most recent meeting of the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12854.521s">Following</a> that meeting, I had some lengthy discussions and feedback from the City's legal teams, as well as some lawyers that work with the ACLU who are involved with Medford People Power. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12870.325s">And</a> I was kind of doing a little bit of back and forth to figure out what sort of language both parties could agree upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12878.33s">Before</a> I get into it, I'll also quickly add that this version that I'm working with contains a slight change from what was forwarded to my colleagues earlier today, because just before the meeting, I believe it was Councilor Callaghan who noticed some misspellings under whistleblower protection. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12897.04s">I</a> ended up amending that in this current draft. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12899.762s">But</a> essentially, the reviews by the city's legal team <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12908.923s">clarified</a> the relationship throughout a lot of this ordinance with respect to the city's working relationship with federal agents and federal law and sort of how that works out in practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12922.17s">So</a> there's a couple of points here. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12925.231s">For</a> instance, the use of local resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12927.813s">What</a> you can see here is in green, these are the edits that were provided. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12931.975s">And</a> these are sort of edits that <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12935.542s">This</a> kind of covers situations where if someone is detained and they end up getting fingerprinted as a result of a criminal proceeding, then that biometric data would end up going into a sort of a centralized government database, which is just how criminal <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12962.808s">enforcement</a> works, both on the federal and local level. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12966.391s">But</a> that doesn't really say, but that's kind of like separate from its potential relationship with ICE. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12974.898s">And</a> there's just a few, there's a few other things here that <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12980.729s">kind</a> of that site-specific federal laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=12984.352s">One</a> thing that came up that the ACLU lawyers pointed out was this phrase right here, an officer employee of Medford Police Department may participate or assist with an operation led by a federal immigration agency to detain persons for civil immigration enforcement purposes unless it is in direct response to a request for immediate response on a temporary basis for officer safety purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13009.313s">or</a> assistance in the apprehension of an individual for whom there is an active arrest warrant issued by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13017.038s">This</a> officer safety phrase in quotes is actually fairly common to include in these sorts of ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13026.083s">And</a> there is a history of court decisions about the use of officer safety and asking for assistance. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13034.188s">So</a> I'm comfortable including that in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13039.78s">Otherwise</a> the most the biggest changes that Yes.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13066.281s">Yes,</a> yes, it does. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13067.922s">The</a> main, so I'll get to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13071.123s">So</a> the main points that the city brought up was the complaints enforcement, et cetera, bits that were added in there at a point in the editing process where <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13090.26s">We</a> originally had this complaints, this complaints procedure, but that actually that actually was redundant to the internal policies of the Medford Police Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13101.807s">So</a> we ended up deleting that and this other cause of action that there that ended up that turns out that that just replicates things that are already in involved in state and federal law. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13113.534s">But</a> otherwise, yeah, this replicates state and federal laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13116.816s">But</a> otherwise, these changes <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13120.291s">basically</a> just make this ordinance consistent with, um, just clarifies the relationship of the ordinance with federal law. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13130.574s">I'd</a> be pleased to answer any specific questions from my colleagues about it.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13926.324s">Yeah,</a> so I just would like to reiterate that I did reach out to all members of the school committee as well as Chief Buckley and asked all of them to submit their feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13942.03s">I</a> invited the chief over to the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee meeting with any concerns or feedback that he might have. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13951.274s">I</a> did not receive a reply. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13954.594s">to</a> that request and I did receive some from the from the school committee and their feedback was incorporated into it into this draft. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13968.877s">The</a> concern that I had, the concern that I ran into from the administration regarding the <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13977.766s">regarding</a> the police mainly had to do with the enforcement clause, which I was told could interfere with police union negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13986.511s">And</a> in this current draft, that ended up being nixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=13991.413s">So</a> I would like to point out that there were efforts to include that feedback into this draft. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14004.125s">The</a> other thing I'd like to point out is that there is a timeliness issue to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14011.652s">The</a> new administration takes office in late January, so I do think that more so than other ordinances, having a policy that protects our undocumented populations in early is essential to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14029.793s">Um,</a> I don't see I don't really see the need to try to weigh the three readings. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14034.556s">That's</a> unanimous. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14035.676s">And,</a> you know, obviously, my colleague is voiced his concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14038.938s">So</a> I would be fine with going for the with just approving the first reading tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14045.582s">I</a> would ask that that motion be amended to specifically accept the edits that were that were proposed in this in this current draft because I didn't hear that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14058.246s">that</a> that was explicitly said in the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14060.507s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14060.928s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14062.129s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14062.849s">Otherwise,</a> that's all I got. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14064.17s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15432.092s">No,</a> so I corresponded with the folks at both the folks at KP Law and Medford People Power, including Lauren Jean about this earlier today. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15448.942s">So</a> the, I believe it was Jean was talking about 5103C. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15457.087s">Was</a> that what she mentioned?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15461.115s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15464.378s">Yeah,</a> so I put into this current draft the one change that was proposed for that, that they proposed for that, which was that no Asian officer employee of the city in performance of official duties shall make any inquiry about citizenship, immigration, or residency status. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15483.754s">And</a> they specifically wanted to make it so that they couldn't <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15489.631s">ask</a> about immigration status. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15494.553s">But</a> I am not 100% sure where else this would have weakened it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15504.198s">So</a> yeah, I did respond. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15504.938s">I</a> did respond. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15509.08s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15614.505s">So</a> the deleted one was the struck through version was no officers or employees of the city of Medford may inquire about the immigration status of a victim, suspect, arrestee, 911 caller or other member of the public with whom they have contact except as required by state law or to provide a public benefit and the <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15636.152s">replacement</a> was no agent, officer or employee of the city in the performance of official duties shall make any inquiry about the citizenship, immigration or residency status of any person seeking to enforce rights or obtain benefits or discriminate in the enforcement of rights or the granting <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15654.306s">of</a> benefits on such basis, unless federal or Massachusetts law so requires for the termination of eligibility of benefits or as may otherwise be required by law or a court of competent jurisdiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15666.468s">No</a> police officer or any city employee shall inquire about the citizenship or immigration status of any victim or witness of domestic violence or any other crime except as required by law. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=15676.53s">That's</a> it.

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3472.498s">Yes,</a> I would like to point out this doesn't solve the issue of quite informing residents before things happen, but a good deal of effort is put into summarizing these meetings in the City Council newsletter in about as high level terms as possible, which I typically do include links to these <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3495.965s">plans</a> in the planning and permitting descriptions of what happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=3500.128s">So</a> it's not a perfect solution to all of the concerns that were brought up by my colleague, but that is one mechanism where we're trying to really simplify what is happening in this committee as it happens.<h2><a href="../2024-12-11_pUMtYvwLQbQ/2024-12-11_pUMtYvwLQbQ.html">City Council Public Health and Community Safety Committee 12-11-24</a></h2>

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3094.824s">Yes,</a> as well as the edit so kindly pointed out by my colleague about the small typo. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3102.907s">And</a> that edit as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3106.67s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3107.33s">There's</a> always something. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3110.572s">On</a> the motion to refer this to regular council pending the section edits and the typo, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3123.799s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3125.74s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3126.36s">No</a> one's on the same, so we could just do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3128.281s">It</a> doesn't have to be rolled. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3129.002s">It</a> does not have to be rolled.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3134.298s">All</a> opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3135.758s">Motion</a> passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3138.359s">Thank</a> you, everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3139.68s">So,</a> this... So, we'll be taking this up at a future regular meeting of the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3151.563s">We'll</a> likely have more discussions there, but it's out of committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3157.485s">Now,</a> for the real reason everybody's here, we're gonna edit the newsletter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3163.769s">I</a> know that y'all been waiting so patiently. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3166.912s">Come</a> on, come on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3169.675s">We're</a> gonna go out of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3172.377s">I</a> just wanna get this done.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3223.078s">One</a> moment, City Council newsletters.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3285.67s">2,</a> 4, 3, 5, 4, the resolution to publish this city council newsletter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3295.899s">I'd</a> like to thank Councilor Tseng for drafting this particular issue of the newsletter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3304.105s">We</a> had, and do apologize that it was only sent out in the, wait, <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3315.115s">Why</a> that's there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3316.057s">That</a> was only sent out in the middle of the day, but essentially the only real difference between this newsletter and previous ones is that they're first there is some. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3329.484s">There</a> is some tentative language on it, which we did last time, like keeping the future tense as well as the past tense and just kind of letting me edit that later when we go into review. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3342.371s">And</a> there's also a nice little point by point breakdown because this is the end of year newsletter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3349.008s">the</a> holiday edition of the most significant accomplishments of city council this year, which would be something nice to discuss as to whether we want to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3362.978s">Bye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3364.799s">Thank</a> you all for showing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3368.642s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3370.623s">So</a> essentially, the first bullet point goes over the override <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3378.035s">The</a> second discusses progress on zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3382.261s">The</a> third bullet point talks about the establishment of the stabilization funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3391.149s">Then</a> the policies to fund the affordable housing trust as well as tax deferrals and the proposed rental assistance program for veterans, communications methods, wildlife feeding ordinance, and the solid waste ordinance, and the leaf blower ordinance, environmental, as well as the upcoming work on the charter committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3416.858s">Councilor</a> Callahan, if you can <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3420.839s">Yep,</a> Councilor Callahan.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3428.662s">I</a> believe that's referring to the HERO Act one.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3445.27s">Yeah,</a> I think I think I put it broadly because I think we re maximize it for seniors, and then we did the time for that that's, that's a really tricky one but I had an in depth discussion with the with Tim cost with Ted cost and about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3464.645s">We</a> so technically passing one of the provisions of the Hero Act that we did pass was actually redundant. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3471.431s">And</a> so it didn't like it didn't add up to. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3474.014s">So</a> if we hadn't already maximized deferrals for seniors, it would have maximized them itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3479.119s">But</a> because we already had done that, it's like it didn't really, he said that there was some utility and actually passing it because then we could go on like a list of cities that had passed it and <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3489.328s">Yeah,</a> but he said, but the more important one was the fact that we tied it was the fact that we end up tying it to inflation to an inflation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3496.93s">So</a> the deferrals would go up every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3498.971s">And</a> I think that's, that's, that's the important part.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3514.777s">Yeah,</a> I am also disinclined from like putting out a very detailed legislative explanation of consumer price indexes and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3526.587s">But</a> I think it, I think it captures
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3547.598s">Yeah,</a> it's it is it is a good thing that it was passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3551.481s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3552.762s">And</a> I guess my other thing is that some of these are sort of what we will do future work, the veterans rental assistance program is not technically passed yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3566.353s">But</a> I mean, I think it's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3568.234s">We</a> have been working on these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3569.575s">And</a> I would say that these are the main bullet points. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3573.338s">And</a> then the <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3575.077s">normal,</a> the kind of general business of what actually happened in December is here as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3584.369s">So</a> yeah, pending the tenses here, <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3593.638s">Does</a> anybody have any particular suggestions about things that should be changed? <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3598.98s">Councilor</a> Callahan.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3646.178s">Councilor</a> Lazzaro.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3703.905s">I'm</a> just deleting these spaces after the periods of the document. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3707.668s">Councilor,</a> feel free to just keep your mics on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3711.491s">Okay,</a> great.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3792.275s">So</a> wait.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3797.239s">Or</a> in our, maybe, was it November? <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3799.401s">Was</a> it the November's newsletter?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3830.972s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3840.037s">Anybody</a> else have any suggestions?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3856.523s">That</a> would be too difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3860.145s">That'd</a> be too difficult to format in LaTeX. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3862.746s">Sorry.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3865.347s">No,</a> it's really hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3867.685s">motion</a> to accept and publish the newsletter is motion to Publish the Proven publish the newsletter pending. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3879.909s">Uh,</a> the events of December 11th because I think there is one. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3886.732s">Yeah,</a> December. <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp8GfomyDk&t=3888.772s">Yeah,</a> two committee meetings pending the December 11th many meetings and to receive and place on

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=413.531s">started.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=414.172s">Welcome</a> to the meeting of the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=424.303s">We</a> have three items on the agenda tonight, and we're going to take them a little bit out of order and <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=433.138s">start</a> by looking at the resolution to allow the director of veteran services to offer housing incentives to veteran renters. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=443.947s">We're</a> joined here today by Teresa DuPont and Veronica Shaw to offer a bit of a recap of where this was at. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=454.836s">This</a> was an idea that veteran services director Shaw had in which <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=460.945s">she</a> would have the ability to use extra funds that were allocated to the veteran's office to essentially have a voucher program for veteran renters so that landlords could get an extra bonus if they choose to rent out to veterans. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=478.093s">We</a> passed this by legal. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=479.354s">It</a> was found that it would have complications. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=482.035s">There</a> are complications in <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=485.173s">letting</a> the city distribute money directly to people to interested parties. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=490.837s">We</a> would have to and Council told us that we would have to first go to a nonprofit and that led to a partnership that was largely initiated by the city staff with housing families. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=506.607s">We</a> have a memo here <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=509.315s">that</a> housing families pass to us, which describes the outline of this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=517.121s">And</a> because it was not, I don't believe we only got this memo yesterday, so it wasn't distributed in the official agenda packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=525.847s">So</a> it's fairly, so I'm just going to read it into the public record real quick, and then I'll let Teresa and Veronica speak about it and answer any questions that we might have. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=539.498s">The</a> memo from housing families as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=541.9s">As</a> a longtime community resource partner of the city of Medford, housing families help support the Medford community by providing homelessness prevention and housing services to income eligible residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=552.627s">Recently,</a> housing families was approached by the city of Medford's veteran service director, Veronica Shaw, city councilor and city councilor Matt Leming to propose a new partnership and a pilot veterans housing assistance program. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=562.854s">The</a> program would provide a rebate incentive to property owners in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=566.877s">who</a> lease their units to residents identifying themselves as active or retired service people. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=570.32s">This</a> program aligns with both the City of Medford and Housing Families' missions of providing housing assistance to residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=576.024s">The</a> City of Medford has already identified a funding source through the Veterans Services Office's general operating budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=581.128s">This</a> funding is required to be dispersed through an intermediary organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=584.39s">Housing</a> Families is uniquely qualified to <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=588.257s">support</a> this program as our organization currently supports several assistance programs for Medford in the greater Boston area and are located locally in Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=598.122s">The</a> intended program eligibility guidelines will be as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=601.363s">One</a> head of household must be an active or retired service member as defined by Mass General Law Chapter 115. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=607.506s">Property</a> must be owner occupied by resident of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=611.188s">Three,</a> proper documentation must be submitted to verify eligibility, including but not limited to an executed lease agreement, verification of address, copy of active service documentation, or certificate of discharge as allowable by Mass General Law, Chapter 115, Section 3A, and the completed W-9 from the recipient or property owner. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=630.573s">Four,</a> program payments will be distributed in the form of a paper check. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=635.135s">Five,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=636.275s">property</a> owners must apply for annual recertification to qualify for subsequent payments. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=641.397s">Six</a> applications will be received on a first come, first served and rolling basis until program funds are extinguished. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=647.959s">Seven,</a> any remaining funds after the annual cycles will be rolled forward to provide funding for future applicants of this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=655.541s">Uh</a> we ask that the city council offer their support of this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=659.382s">Best</a> regards, Chief Executive Officer, Housing Families <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=666.423s">further</a> questions from my colleagues, I'll go ahead and hand it over to Teresa Dupont and Veronica Shaw so that they can speak about this and answer any questions that we might have about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=679.112s">I</a> see, Councilor, hold on, I still need to get used to leave you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=685.357s">Okay,</a> I don't think it's on the weird. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=687.138s">I</a> actually can't see your light. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=688.719s">It's</a> sort of blocked by the other light. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=691.341s">No,</a> I mean, literally, the lamp is blocking the red thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=693.723s">So</a> I can't <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=695.137s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=695.937s">OK,</a> go ahead

href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=703.342s">What?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=704.542s">This</a> is weird. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=705.623s">OK,</a> now I'm seeing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=706.443s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=708.684s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=712.306s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=713.847s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=713.947s">Aha.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=726.575s">Yes,</a> it was distributed by the clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=728.756s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=737.983s">It</a> should be, I distributed it.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=747.389s">News,</a> hold on.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=759.612s">Yeah,</a> it should have been. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=761.792s">I</a> am searching through my email.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=774.673s">Documents</a> for committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=776.074s">It</a> was sent to your Gmail.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=782.517s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=783.757s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=784.277s">I'm</a> looking at it right now.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=795.102s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=795.362s">Yeah,</a> so the documents for committee meeting, it should have both a copy of the Google <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=803.019s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=804.62s">Pending</a> any further questions, go ahead and press the button on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=809.502s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=812.444s">Try</a> speaking.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=911.86s">pressing</a> the next on button. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=913.402s">I</a> think you're can you hear me?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1293.583s">Actually,</a> so I could, I could talk about that a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1296.666s">So</a> with regards to the <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1298.308s">ordinance</a> change, the paper in front of you is the proposed language that originally was referred to this committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1305.472s">And</a> I was planning on talking about that a little bit after the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1310.375s">So</a> we would have to refer that to legal so that council can say what is the best way to frame this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1318.2s">I</a> do have some proposed language and if they <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1322.362s">folks</a> have any more input on sort of the maximum amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1326.024s">That's</a> also very, you know, we can be amenable to that at this stage as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1330.587s">But</a> what you have in front of you is just the previous paper version of this paper that was referred to committee that most definitely will have to be changed.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1757.176s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1758.657s">Any</a> other comments?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1785.748s">Councilor</a> Callahan, wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1789.089s">Next</a> on, I keep pressing the next on, I'm not sure what, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1794.752s">Mic</a> on.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1832.993s">All</a> right, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1834.214s">So</a> with just a couple of logistical things related to this, I'm going to share my screen really quick here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1843.019s">All</a> right, so in order to do this, what you have in front of you is an additional authority added under the Director of Veterans Services. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1861.62s">The</a> draft language was what I originally penned under the assumption that the veteran service director could do this independently. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1870.984s">Obviously,</a> they cannot. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1873.345s">And</a> so what I would propose is to replace that language with the following, which says the director of veteran services shall at their discretion and his funds are available. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1883.889s">have</a> the authority to partner with a nonprofit organization which may offer cash incentives of up to $750 annually to landlords who offer rental housing to veterans. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1892.096s">I</a> think that the best way forward is to first discuss this language, pass it to legal counsel, and then simultaneously pass this package to the regular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1908.39s">to</a> a regular council meeting, and then once we have feedback from legal, revise the language there in accordance with whatever the recommendations might be, if they have any better way to phrase this than what I came up with. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1922.817s">Oh,</a> Councilor Callahan.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1950.571s">We</a> could potentially move it to the fee schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1954.832s">That</a> could be a solution to it so that it is, <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1962.587s">updated</a> automatically, that could be one solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1970.373s">But</a> I think that either way, this language is going to have to go by council. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1976.379s">And</a> so I am comfortable referring this to a regular council meeting and then doing <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1984.483s">a</a> little bit more research and potentially revising this to go into the fee schedule, for instance, and then voting on it there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=1996.67s">Councilor</a> Lazzaro.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2006.598s">That</a> being said, do we have a motion on the floor to refer this to regular council and legal?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2018.24s">On</a> the motion by Councilor Callahan, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2022.841s">All</a> those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2023.721s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2024.682s">All</a> those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2025.962s">Motion</a> passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2028.302s">Thank</a> you both very much for your work on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2033.61s">And</a> we will likely be looking at it at the next regular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2041.415s">Moving</a> on, the city council newsletter. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2044.717s">I</a> apologize for the last minute nature that we've been sending these things out at. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2054.503s">We're</a> sort of doing a rotating schedule whereby different councillors <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2059.298s">draft</a> different portions of the newsletter. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2062.139s">But</a> in that latest email, you should have a link to this Google Doc here, which contains the draft of Councilor Collins, as well as a couple of points that I added from late October, which events that occurred after our last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2084.283s">Now,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2086.994s">Councilor</a> Collins version of the newsletter actually does contain a couple of <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2094.761s">points</a> that we are going to discuss in the meeting literally right after this, which I don't think has been done in a newsletter previously. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2107.349s">So</a> I do think that news, personally, that newsletters should report things that have already happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2118.537s">But</a> one way to get around this is to <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2124.859s">potentially</a> approve this language contingent on what happens in the next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2130.722s">And</a> then if we do, in fact, pass those, I could, with the permission of this committee, while formatting the newsletter, just change everything to the past tense. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2139.266s">Because</a> when we're reporting things out, I think I would rather have more current events happen instead of waiting a month before we tell people what happened in a committee meeting that's happening today. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2154.508s">So</a> that could be one way to write this, even though, technically, we're, as of this moment, the things discussed in this newsletter haven't happened yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2167.139s">But</a> that being said, Councilor Callahan, I can see that your mic is still on, so I'm not.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2177.665s">Okay,</a> cool. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2179.947s">Um,</a> do we have any other specific suggestions to the content of the newsletter as it stands in this this Google document? <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2189.917s">Councilor</a> Tseng?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2226.228s">That's</a> very reasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2228.953s">Councilor</a> Lazzaro.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2241.478s">Yeah,</a> that's from my draft. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2243.518s">So</a> I just keep those there for consistency's sake, but those wouldn't be in the formatted version. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2248.7s">I</a> could even just delete those now for clarity. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2257.947s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2258.187s">Do</a> we have any other comments? <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2264.45s">Give</a> folks a moment to go through it before we take any motions on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2279.777s">Councilor</a> Lazzaro.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2287.104s">No,</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2287.684s">So</a> I think I think in this case, the motion would be specifically to approve it contingent upon the what is voted on in the next meeting.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2307.12s">On</a> the motion by Councilor Lazzaro, seconded by <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2310.558s">Councilor</a> Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2312.299s">All</a> those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2314.261s">All</a> those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2316.383s">Motion</a> passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2318.705s">And</a> the very last item on the agenda is just a brief update on what's going on with the City Council listening sessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2331.366s">So</a> I know that there has been a little bit of behind the scenes activity, mainly because these listening sessions just require Councilors kind of running around and trying to coordinate with different groups, get something on the calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2343.611s">But</a> I'm just going to go ahead and give the opportunity to Councilors Lazzaro and Callahan, who I know have been working on some of these initiatives as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2353.236s">So</a> whoever would like to go first, Councilor Lazzaro.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2432.982s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2433.483s">Wonderful.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2437.387s">Council</a> call him.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2532.196s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2535.378s">Well,</a> I am very, very glad to hear that these, these issues are happening and we are <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2544.52s">actively</a> reaching out to members of the community that, again, like you're saying, normally do not come into these chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2553.146s">And</a> I'm looking forward to the reports of the listening sessions that have happened and just a brief outline of some of the feedback that we've gotten there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2566.735s">Just,</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2568.156s">So</a> thank you all very much for your wonderful work on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2572.919s">Councilor</a> Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2576.869s">it.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2594.173s">All</a> right, so the one for the Arab.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2620.038s">Councilor</a> Lazzaro.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2667.13s">Great,</a> I don't think we, do we necessarily have to take a vote on that one? <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2672.311s">No,</a> yeah, okay, cool. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2675.592s">All</a> right, great, sounds good. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2687.055s">Wonderful,</a> all right, is there, all right, is there any public participation? <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2691.856s">I'm</a> not seeing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2695.629s">Anybody</a> bite on zoom or in the chambers, see that Teresa's knitting over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2702.851s">So,</a> oh, Councilor Callahan.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2755.778s">I</a> feel like accessing these groups is sometimes it's a matter of personal connections and trying to communicate with folks who you know might have those connections. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2769.105s">I</a> know a couple of parents who might be able to tap into their parental networks to figure that particular one out. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2782.907s">So</a> that could be one. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2784.868s">I</a> mean, that could be something to pursue in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2789.451s">In</a> terms of students, because that was another one on our list, my thoughts on that would be you'd really have to get more formal, sort of a more formal, <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2803.258s">lines</a> for that, like probably reaching out to the principal of Medford High to see if they're okay with it, or reaching out to student government. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2813.924s">So</a> in that case, I would imagine that <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2819.736s">Yeah,</a> in that case, you definitely need to have a slightly more formal. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2825.521s">And</a> then there's also just different community centers and social centers around the city, which is where the senior center idea comes from. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2836.11s">I</a> know I was thinking through reaching out to groups of veterans, in which case the VFW would be a good solution for that, a good way to address that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2848.066s">But</a> yeah, I also think that we did kind of have a bit of a lull in scheduling these listening sessions over the summer because when we were scheduling our ambitious schedule, we didn't understand that it was the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2861.24s">And</a> nobody was really around. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2863.102s">So</a> that's just something that happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2866.305s">But</a> I'm glad to see that they're picking up now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2869.148s">And</a> I think that, you know, when Councilor Lazzaro and I were brainstorming, we're like thinking of the regular sessions at the senior center. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2876.335s">The</a> logic behind that was that it is an easy kind of like it is an easy month by month thing where we can put as little brain power as possible into reaching out and scheduling to a new group. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2887.625s">So</a> that's just a way to sort of keep it going. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2890.207s">Councilor</a> Lazzaro.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2940.701s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2941.001s">Do</a> we have any motions on the floor? <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2945.082s">Do</a> we have a second?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2948.283s">On</a> the motion to adjourn by Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2952.044s">That</a> was Councilor Tseng, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2953.385s">Okay,</a> seconded by Councilor Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2955.425s">All</a> those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2956.146s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2956.786s">All</a> those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2957.766s">Motion</a> passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2958.546s">Meeting</a> is adjourned. <a href="https://youtu.be/7gllzJBT7FA&t=2959.347s">Thank</a> you, everybody.<h2><a href="../2024-11-14_aqU6GwG1M88/2024-11-14_aqU6GwG1M88.html">City Council Planning and Permitting Committee 11-13-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=416.664s">know</a> if he's going to be attending in person.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=454.824s">If</a> they know if Scott's going to be attending building commissioner.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=487.722s">My</a> understanding was that he had some recommendations for changing some stuff about the green score to make it not conflict with the building code. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=501.548s">But</a> if we already have that written down somewhere so that it could be amended during the meeting, then that would be fine too.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=525.072s">Okay,</a> okay, just as long as you see what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=530.936s">Adam,</a> any word on when Councilor Scarpella is gonna show up? <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=537.392s">Or</a> did he give you any indication of that?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=550.239s">All</a> right, let's do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=553.061s">So</a> welcome to the planning and permitting committee of November 13th, 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=561.141s">During</a> this meeting, we're just going to we are going to go over mainly the proposed green zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=568.625s">Green</a> score zoning ordinance at the end of the meeting, we'll have a short presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=574.488s">I</a> mean, very short on the Salem street corridor, which is going to be coming up the next regular. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=581.371s">meeting</a> of the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=584.653s">Just</a> as a reminder, if you would like to be recognized and speak, please raise your hand on Zoom first and I'll recognize you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=597.122s">But</a> the goal of this meeting is to refer out the green score by the end of it for the regular City Council meeting next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=611.309s">And</a> with that being said, I will turn it over to Paola, unless any of my colleagues on city council have anything they'd like to say first, feel free to raise your hand really quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=625.306s">Oh,</a> Adam.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=637.077s">Oh,</a> okay, sorry, I thought that.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=643.618s">Okay,</a> sorry, that was- That's okay, don't worry about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=646.558s">Yep,</a> yep. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=647.338s">Don't</a> worry about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=648.379s">Go</a> ahead, go ahead and take a roll.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=671.642s">She</a> is absent.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=677.127s">Present.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=680.99s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=681.351s">So</a> do any of my colleagues on City Council have anything they'd like to say first? <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=690.519s">No?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=691.491s">All</a> right, in that case, Paola, take it away.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=722.102s">Are</a> you able to share?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1133.963s">I</a> think he's a reminder it's generally it's generally only acceptable if the chair recognizes folks from the floor, but go ahead.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1247.009s">Oh,</a> Councilor Council President Bears.

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1749.637s">If</a> there are any questions, feel free to raise your hand on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1754.66s">Director</a> Hunt.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1840.694s">Any</a> other questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1843.636s">All</a> right, continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1844.677s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1966.011s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1966.391s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1966.751s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1971.451s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=1971.893s">Keep</a> going.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2107.467s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2113.568s">Any</a> other input from anybody else on the call? <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2126.191s">Councilor</a> Callahan.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2143.116s">Mr.</a> Commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2147.478s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2150.236s">I</a> just ask you to unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2151.838s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2187.873s">Director</a> Hunt? <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2191.917s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2192.738s">I</a> might have mistaken that pause as a... No, no, it's okay.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2200.867s">Director</a> Hunt?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2408.101s">Go</a> ahead.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2557.227s">Personally,</a> I'm thinking that a lot of these points can be, I mean, a lot of these do seem to be relatively minor changes at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2573.462s">And,</a> sorry, I was looking at Zach to see if, and I think that, <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2585.182s">This</a> is likely subject to the building commissioner's previous changes that he recommended. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2592.605s">This</a> is still likely able to be referred to regular council. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2599.068s">And</a> if the Planning Department and the building commissioner do come up with any recommendations over the next week, we could incorporate those during a regular meeting.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2624.682s">So</a> with that, is there any further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2633.317s">you</a> know, I do think like these are important technical points, but they can also be done between the consultants and the staff and sort of hammered out during some of the, during some longer meetings between individuals and recommended to the council or the CD board later. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2654.707s">With</a> that, is there any other comments from <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2660.931s">staff</a> or city councilors? <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2668.576s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2671.017s">Do</a> we have any motions on the floor?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2682.184s">I'm</a> aware of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2684.285s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2685.886s">I'll</a> get to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2687.147s">I'll</a> get to that.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2695.488s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2695.968s">Motion</a> to refer out to the regular meeting pending discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2698.67s">And</a> I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2699.731s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2704.696s">Do</a> we have a second on that?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2708.305s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2709.306s">And</a> with that, I do see that Mr. Fiore's hand is raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2713.551s">So</a> we will move to public comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2716.875s">Just</a> to check, because this was a little bit unclear, like it was kind of a last minute switch to Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2723.122s">President</a> Bears or Councilor Callahan, can you verify that there is, is there anybody physically in the audience at the hall right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2730.114s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2730.914s">Okay,</a> in that case, we'll move on to public comment and I'm going to ask Mr. Fiore to unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2741.28s">Mr.</a> Fiore, if you'd be able to provide your name and address for the record.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2888.859s">I</a> was taking notes on what you just said. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2890.701s">So</a> you're wondering if the effects of irrigation on green roofs, zoning related to tree height and their ability to affect solar panels. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2899.192s">And</a> could you just rephrase your first question again?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2941.843s">Okay,</a> so inclusion of cool, is there inclusion of cool roofs in the green score inclusion of the effects of irrigation on green roofs or anything about that zoning related to tall trees? <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2953.231s">I</a> do know that there is some work being done with regards to the tree that there is some work being done on the tree ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2961.617s">I</a> think that was, that's primarily Councilor Collins and Councilor Callahan who are doing or <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2970.783s">spearheading</a> a lot of the work on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=2974.484s">If</a> Councilor Cowlin, if you have any information related to trees, feel free to raise your hand, but otherwise, otherwise, Paola, can you confirm whether or not there's anything related to cool roofs or anything related to irrigation on green roofs in the current draft?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3144.801s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3145.901s">Thank</a> you, Paola. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3146.601s">I</a> think that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3147.802s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3148.142s">I</a> appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3149.602s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3151.069s">All</a> right, and not seeing any other folks here for public comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3156.311s">So</a> Council President Bears.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3182.565s">I</a> also emailed it to Mr. Feuer during his public comment, so I feel like we just really rushed to get those documents all at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3192.795s">So</a> there is a, there's, Director Hunt?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3233.705s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3235.426s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3237.207s">We</a> have a motion on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3241.489s">Mr.</a> Clerk, can you please call the roll? <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3246.712s">Do</a> you have the exact text of the motion, by the way?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3292.873s">Yes</a> or yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3295.735s">One</a> absent the motion passes the chair is referred out to regular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3304.347s">And</a> the other item on the agenda is just a quick, very quick update on the Salem Street corridor. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3310.972s">Is</a> that, Paola, as well, you had that update?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3391.846s">Wonderful,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3394.609s">Councilor</a> Scarpelli.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3547.754s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3549.655s">Council</a> President Bears.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3644.985s">Well,</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3645.705s">We,</a> we went over ground rules at the beginning, raise, raise hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3648.446s">And</a> then, uh, and then, and I saw that, uh, director hunt raised her hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3654.769s">And</a> so then I'll, uh, did you have, um, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3660.611s">Councilor</a> Scarpelli.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3701.896s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3702.236s">Councilor</a> Scarpelli, director Hunt.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3834.901s">Thank</a> you, Director Hunt. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3836.222s">Councilor</a> Scarpelli.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3971.455s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Scapelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3972.996s">Do</a> we have any motions on the floor?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3985.129s">Sure,</a> yeah, let's go into public participation for this item. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=3993.294s">Mr.</a> Fiore?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4076.51s">Well,</a> the city does have a number of folks who volunteer in certain service that usually they're on boards or those sorts of volunteer positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4091.694s">So</a> I was on the CPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4094.675s">So</a> the city does utilize volunteers for a lot of different tasks. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4100.457s">I</a> don't know if we've utilized them for that one specifically, but Council President Bears.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4150.525s">Yeah,</a> no, the community liaisons I think is a very good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4154.108s">So</a> those are folks that are probably most similar to what <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4159.761s">Mr.</a> Fiora was just talking about, but you're right in terms of just strictly location-based. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4165.286s">I'm</a> not sure if we have one of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4167.267s">Paola.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4253.99s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4254.611s">Thank</a> you, Paula. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4257.481s">So</a> with that, unless someone else has entered the city hall physically, I'm not seeing it.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4266.145s">Yeah,</a> not seeing any other folks who'd like to do public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4273.067s">So</a> we'll close that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4275.948s">And</a> with that, do we have any motions on the floor? <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4279.55s">Motion</a> to adjourn. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4280.95s">We</a> have a second.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4288.134s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4289.795s">On</a> the motion to adjourn by Council President Bears, seconded by Councilor Callahan, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4299.683s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4308.771s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4309.852s">Four</a> in the affirmative, one absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4311.593s">Motion</a> passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4312.294s">The</a> meeting is adjourned. <a href="https://youtu.be/aqU6GwG1M88&t=4313.235s">Thank</a> you very much for coming out tonight, everybody.<h2><a href="../2024-11-12_NDgiDfoPie4/2024-11-12_NDgiDfoPie4.html">City Council 11-12-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1589.201s">I'd</a> also like to point out that people are confused about this because an organization that Councilor Scarpelli is in the leadership, I've sent people out an email saying that this was what was written in the ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1598.951s">So</a> if you send an email.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=1619.0s">I</a> mean, you can't send an email out saying that this is what it's about.

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5240.038s">Yes,</a> thank you, Council President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5242.479s">The</a> only amendment to this that council advised was to remove the up to and up to 100% in the very last paragraph of the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5255.425s">but</a> otherwise both council and the assessor thought that this was perfectly acceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5262.651s">So</a> I would motion to amend this to remove the two words up to in the very last paragraph and pass it.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5740.162s">No,</a> I just wanted to clarify that in our correspondence that I had with Paul Raihee, he said that he did select the contractor already that will be doing this work, the same company that did historic renovations for Faneuil Hall in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5755.932s">So</a> I don't know the name of that company specifically, but I had a back and forth with him about with him and some members of the CPA about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5764.257s">So</a> that <a href="https://youtu.be/NDgiDfoPie4&t=5765.828s">already</a> is selected as my okay so he did that already Yeah, okay.<h2><a href="../2024-10-30_FomUj4CcW5M/2024-10-30_FomUj4CcW5M.html">City Council 10-29-24</a></h2>

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1449.576s">Thank</a> you, Council President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=1450.777s">I</a> have a motion to suspend the rules and take public participation out of order.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2319.193s">This</a> is just a very brief comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2321.314s">So</a> I do definitely hear what Marianne is saying about during any construction phase, it's likely that parking would be unavailable during that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2328.877s">But</a> the RFP, just to really highlight this, the RFP does call for the construction of a parking garage in any developments that are created so long term. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2342.144s">ideally</a> going by what the RFP says, this wouldn't affect parking availability in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2349.874s">So</a> that's the idea, but I just wanted to, again, I'm hearing what Marianne is saying about the temporary unavailability during construction, but I did want to highlight that for folks in the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=2358.404s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4430.53s">Thank</a> you, Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4432.791s">So</a> this is pretty much a cut and dry resolution which would adopt the two parts of the HERO Act that City Councils explicitly need to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4447.257s">I've</a> talked to the Veteran Services Director and the assessor <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4451.559s">about</a> this. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4452.161s">So</a> clause 22. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4458.815s">that</a> would allow for the city to go up to the full amount of exemptions for veterans, although we already do that in other parts of general laws, chapter 59. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4475.399s">So</a> it wouldn't necessarily add to that, but Ted tells me there's no harm in adopting it anyway, just for future purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4482.201s">The</a> real effect of that would be <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4484.382s">The</a> real important part here is clause 22 I, which would basically increase the amount of folks tax exemptions on a yearly basis according to increases in the consumer price index. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4497.727s">So</a> it's another mechanism to make these kind of dollar amount exemptions automatic without a city council or the state having to come in and <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4510.211s">do</a> that explicitly. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4511.252s">So</a> that's one of the new things that the HERO Act allows. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4515.877s">So</a> I yeah, it's a you know, it's a fairly straightforward adoption of provisions of state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4526.086s">And</a> I would motion to send this to legal for review. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4535.84s">I</a> talked it over with head he recommended to send it to legal for review first.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4663.666s">Yeah,</a> sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4664.207s">Yeah,</a> so this is, there's already, I mean, Ted's already seen the text of this and he approved everything, but I could add onto that motion just a request from the assessor for a memo, an additional memo to outline his approval for it in the public record if my colleagues think that that is appropriate.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4731.957s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4732.937s">Sounds</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/FomUj4CcW5M&t=4733.378s">So</a> moved.<h2><a href="../2024-10-23_eYLl0XsNfvs/2024-10-23_eYLl0XsNfvs.html">Invest in Medford Town Hall</a></h2>
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4487.355s">Just</a> to add to that, so this actually came up at an event at a small house party where we were talking about these measures. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4498.262s">Somebody</a> asked me, well, if you're proposing to put $500,000 towards the GDW for road repairs, I live on a private road, how would that affect me? <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4508.769s">I</a> had no idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4509.93s">So</a> I ended up emailing Tim McGibbon, CC, the fellow who asked me, and what Tim said was that <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4517.715s">there</a> is no, so just by the fact, by the nature of it being private, there's no legal obligation for him to actively repair these roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4528.639s">But</a> he said that they, if, when they have capacity, they will do it anyway, just to keep the city nice, and putting a permanent road repair crew into being going will just give them, <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4543.585s">more</a> capacity to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4545.526s">So</a> that was his perspective on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4549.128s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1110.8s">Um,</a> at the commemorations and acknowledgement section, uh, we, I put the, I put the two, uh, commemorations from the October 15th meeting in there, but we tabled a couple of stuff really, really quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1124.506s">And</a> I was having trouble remembering exactly which ones we table and which ones we very quickly passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1129.628s">So,</a> um, I would, do you want me to run down and check?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1170.373s">Can</a> we just, how do we make these all just so that people can unmute themselves? <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1173.996s">How</a> do we? <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1176.939s">No,</a> no, I mean, this is just a regular time.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1199.898s">So,</a> in the, you know, in some of the earlier ones we might have accidentally left off. <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1206.403s">a</a> couple of them or not put all of them on there especially because the initial one was covering a four-month period and it was pretty lengthy as it was but um I think I think moving forward it's probably it would just be nice to show people um who and all was commemorated at these these different meetings.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1227.978s">Sorry?</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1236.952s">When</a> was that passed? <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1265.21s">What</a> date was Larry's passing? <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1269.073s">Really?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1271.755s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1275.877s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1276.378s">It's</a> hard for me to find the records of the ones I can get the date.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1288.786s">Well,</a> the date of the resolution would have been the 15th, but the date of his passing. <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1294.673s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1295.733s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1295.993s">October</a> 14. <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1296.453s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1304.795s">Does</a> this seem like an appropriate addition? <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1306.816s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1317.058s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1317.638s">Do</a> we have a motion on the floor? <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1324.4s">Chairman.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EOItPyTno-c&t=1327.281s">Was</a> that a second Councilor Tseng?

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=796.773s">Speaking</a> of.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=801.114s">As</a> we were saying, we lost Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=804.236s">She</a> walks in the door.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=811.127s">Would</a> we withdraw the motion so that we can allow for more discussion from the colleagues who just arrived? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=819.43s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1568.07s">This</a> is just to add on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1570.091s">I</a> fully agree that the cost of these facilities needs to be determined. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1576.115s">Probably</a> also the very basic question of which parks and what would be an ideal number to shoot for across the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1585.762s">How</a> many of these facilities do we want to build?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1755.871s">It's</a> just a question for Councilor Tseng what resident when you're putting this forward, what resident complaints were you specifically responding to? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1768.002s">Was</a> it folks that were visiting certain parks who wanted this? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1773.066s">What</a> was, could you just talk a little bit about the feedback you were getting that led to this?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1902.332s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1904.406s">On</a> that, I would motion to request feedback on the cost, potential cost savings and need for these sanitary facilities in public spaces around Medford from Tim McGivern and Alicia Hunt. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1933.11s">as</a> well as their recommendation, as well as their long-term recommendations on this problem.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1943.555s">Yeah,</a> I was trying to think of a way to word it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=1946.636s">But</a> essentially, given the resources, the intent of it is given the resources the city has now, how much do they think that their resources should be prioritized to implementing this?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2091.004s">I'm</a> just unsure how that would be implemented. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2092.845s">Would</a> it be an email to all city staff and then request a general request for feedback?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2177.833s">new</a> wording of the motion could be, and feel free to feel free to jump in if any of my more experienced colleagues have recommendations to edit it, but a motion to request feedback from department heads on the <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2196.235s">idea</a> of installing permanent sanitary facilities in public spaces, including our parks, with the invitation to have one-on-one meetings with council members if they feel the need to. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuecN3BHnp0&t=2211.705s">Okay.</a> <h2><a href="../2024-10-15_kP4iRYobyr0/2024-10-15_kP4iRYobyr0.html">City Council Committee of the Whole 10-15-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=122.134s">Present.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1714.838s">I'm</a> going to try to respond to one thing there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1716.578s">I</a> didn't hear a specific question, but you did say that Medford's not like our surrounding towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1724.02s">No,</a> I said Winchester. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1725.081s">Yeah,</a> we're not like Winchester. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1726.521s">90%</a> of cities in the state of Massachusetts have had an override. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1732.203s">Medford</a> has one of the lowest operating budgets per capita of any city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1741.625s">midsize</a> city in the state of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1744.446s">And</a> that is in large part because we are one of the 10% of cities that has never had an override. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1751.749s">So</a> you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=1752.409s">We</a> are not like our neighbors that have had overrides and we have less money for it.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2282.138s">Saying</a> that we can address the budgetary problems of the Medford public school system with free cash is like me saying the government gave me a $1,200 check from COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2295.965s">So</a> I don't have to look for a job right now because that check is going to last me another <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2301.493s">another</a> two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2303.313s">It's</a> the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2304.153s">The</a> government gave us, the government gave the city of Medford some money. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2308.554s">It</a> was a one-time thing from COVID and the proposal that we can plug ongoing costs from free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2315.175s">All</a> that would do is drain our reserves and we'd be back at square one in five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2323.137s">If</a> these overrides don't pass straight up, there will be layoffs in the school system and the roads will continue to be in disrepair. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2330.538s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2792.681s">So</a> adding on to what Councilor Callahan said, partially this is due to the lingering costs of COVID, which resulted in both decreased funding going to the school system, partially that was just because you have fewer students going into public schools, and partially because <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2812.608s">there</a> was a lot of activity in the healthcare system from COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2815.793s">So</a> there is a sort of a, so the cost of health insurance, which we have to pay ended up rising. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2821.504s">Those</a> are some of the more short term reasons why we need this now. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2824.809s">Longer</a> term, <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2826.321s">The</a> way that Prop 2 NAP is designed is the total amount of money that the city can take in basically can't go up by more than 2.5% every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2836.11s">While</a> inflation has averaged for the past 44 years at 3.1% over time, that compounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2842.436s">So</a> the budget today <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2844.137s">is</a> only a fraction, well, it's only about 78% as valuable today as it was back in 1980. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2852.464s">So</a> Prop 2.5 has this effect long-term on municipal budget where it squeezes resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2858.929s">Most</a> cities in Massachusetts have addressed this with the intended mechanism for overcoming this, which is periodic elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2867.675s">This</a> is just the first time we're doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2869.677s">That's</a> part of the reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2871.318s">the</a> fact that we're so late to the game there is part of the reason that again we are 320 out of 351 cities in terms of our per capita budget and that is the reason why our schools could definitely be doing <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2887.594s">better.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2888.174s">That</a> is the reason why you see so many potholes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2890.435s">This</a> is one step in addressing that situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2894.918s">Once</a> again, free cash, one time funding is not an actual longer term solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=2902.141s">If</a> we just went with free cash, that would be drained in a couple of years, even shorter than the four to five year span I put, I said earlier, and then that's time.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4482.151s">I'm</a> sorry, just to go back on that 3 to 5% thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4484.993s">It's</a> not 3 to 5% in totality. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4486.713s">It</a> actually is recommended to generate 3 to 5% in free cash every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4491.036s">So</a> that is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4492.717s">I'm</a> not sure where you're getting.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4497.639s">You</a> can Google it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4498.64s">You</a> can look it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4499.32s">I</a> encourage you to. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4501.161s">But</a> the point is, you generate three to 5% in free cash, and then it goes that can aggregate over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4506.984s">And</a> then that can go towards one time capital expenditures, like for instance, two new fire trucks for the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4513.427s">That's</a> how these big, that's how these sort of, I'd say, midsize expenses are accounted for. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4520.003s">Again,</a> if I have a savings account and I'm living above my means, then eventually the savings account would run out. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4531.491s">So</a> you're not supposed to plug the school budget every single year with free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4537.594s">because</a> it would run out eventually. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4540.115s">We</a> did that with $1.75 million this past year with the understanding that we would then do an override to try to fix the problem in the long term. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4549.658s">Free</a> cash is not a long-term solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4552.459s">That</a> keeps getting repeated, and I really just want to drive the point home. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4556.04s">It</a> is not actually an answer to this problem.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4645.897s">So</a> in terms of how much free cash we actually have left, I don't have the numbers right in front of me, but I'm just remembering the expenditures off the top of my head. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4656.42s">I</a> believe after it was certified this past June, the number was 34 million, but I believe enough of that has been earmarked for various one-time expenditures at this point so that the actual number is, correct me if I'm wrong, would be about <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4671.222s">10</a> to 11 million in reserves right now just because I see so much I can see someone shaking their head in the audience but I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4682.905s">So</a> again, this is ballpark numbers because we did allocate free cash first for the stabilization funds, which recently went to things like those light posts that were falling over, that were, you know, rusted. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4698.65s">They</a> went to $3 million for the MSBA study. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4703.732s">It</a> went to pay for HVAC systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4707.833s">It</a> went to pay for, there was a, <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=4713.5s">Yeah,</a> there's a long list of items that were in some memos from a couple of months ago that I think some of my colleagues could help me out.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5408.745s">Councilor</a> Leming, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5412.126s">I'd</a> just like to really emphasize that if you're interested in learning more about the shortfalls in the school, in the Medford Public Schools budget, then the videos and the presentations that were given during the budget season at the Medford School Committee meetings, I believe around June, would be where you want to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5432.612s">So</a> those are on YouTube. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5433.752s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5828.308s">So</a> for the size of the override, what I'll say is that we got, we went 44 years without an override, and this is the first time that we're asking the voters to do an override, which has become very commonplace in other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5846.658s">And</a> so, yeah, if we, you know, there potentially is, <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5853.301s">a</a> debt exclusion in the future for the high school as a capital project, but just in terms of level expenses, the overrides are a mechanism to undo, to overcome the effects of inflation long-term. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5869.773s">So</a> I will just point out that we've gone this long without an override, and this is the first time that we're asking for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5877.867s">We've</a> survived pretty long so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5881.669s">And</a> we're pretty late to the game, to be honest. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5886.753s">Will</a> another override be needed in another 44 years? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5890.635s">Maybe,</a> because inflation will keep going up. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5894.017s">But</a> right now, we know that we need this, or else, again, the roads will continue to be in the state that they're in, and we will have to have <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5904.376s">a</a> lot of layoffs. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5905.357s">That's</a> not a scare tactic. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5906.457s">That's</a> just the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5907.798s">It's</a> just math. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=5908.739s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7343.632s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7344.352s">So</a> I would like to point out that in asking for specifics for these things, there is a bit of a kind of a circular logic that goes in because if hypothetically we were to put forward to the voters the exact pay scale of each teacher in each line item, that's not really possible because union contracts haven't actually been negotiated, haven't been negotiated yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7366.819s">So</a> that would be premature.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7371.861s">No,</a> no, no, no.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7376.284s">And</a> so, I mean, it goes for a lot of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7380.147s">It</a> goes for the development of the plans for a fire station as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7385.03s">So</a> you don't have to have the plans completely finalized and approved, but you can have a estimate for the full cost of the station from the people that are developing the plans beforehand. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7397.218s">Right</a> now, <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7398.178s">estimate</a> is $30 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7400.48s">And</a> it goes, I mean, it goes for the salaries as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7404.282s">So,</a> you know, we are, we put in the ballot questions, the areas where it would go to, but we can't say it will go to 10 teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7413.529s">It</a> will go to 15 parents, et cetera, because those need to be negotiated after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7418.632s">On</a> the other hand, if, on the other hand, if we do <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7421.574s">I've</a> also heard people say, OK, how can you promise higher wages, for instance, if those contracts haven't been negotiated? <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7428.961s">So</a> this becomes a bit of a chicken and egg problem when asking for specifics versus not being specific enough on these valid questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=7436.549s">I'd</a> just like to make that general point, so thank you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8495.515s">Well,</a> just to make the point that if you have a, you know, we, this is a request to pay slightly more property taxes, but it also goes along with the general point of, yeah, $37 a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8509.626s">That's,</a> that is slightly more, you know, with the, to go along with the general point of you get what you pay for, <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8519.887s">Again,</a> we are a very underfunded city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8524.112s">And</a> we would like that to not be the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8527.216s">And</a> this is a step in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8530.96s">That's</a> all.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9071.544s">I'm</a> sorry, where is the woman who asked the question?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9079.227s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9080.028s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9081.208s">No,</a> I just wanted to point out. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9082.309s">So</a> there was, so I've seen this, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9085.566s">error</a> that people have been doing with the DLS calculator the past week or so, where they're taking the $7.5 million that comes from questions seven and eight combined, and then they're just adding that to the $30 million and then saying... I think she just added the $2 million for the estimated... Yeah, that is actually...
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9600.659s">So</a> first, just to make the point that disagreeing doesn't mean it's a fear attack, it just means I disagree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9607.391s">Just</a> want to put that out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9609.082s">The</a> actual answer to that is that the communities that haven't had to do Prop 2.5 overrides to keep a level budget are either the communities that have just much bigger budgets overall than we do, like Boston, or in cases like Cambridge, they invested in areas like Kendall Square years and years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9633.961s">Medford</a> could have invested in that <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9638.504s">kind</a> of development a long time ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9640.045s">We</a> just never did that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9641.847s">And</a> smaller communities that don't really have the opportunity to do that sort of commercial development. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9646.891s">Some</a> towns are basically just residential properties and not a whole lot of commercial activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9653.596s">They</a> have to do these sorts of overrides regularly. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9656.258s">So</a> Medford kind of avoided this by just doing cuts and cuts and cuts until we became a very underfunded community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9663.879s">And</a> now that we're at this point, there's really not much of a choice except for either kicking the can down the road more, which doesn't solve the problem, or doing one of these overrides like Our Neighbors, or we could get a time machine and do a lot more commercial development. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9682.142s">But</a> of course, that's not an option. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=9683.603s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10017.063s">I</a> mean, I think we've already gone over the free cash issue quite a bit.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10025.929s">It</a> wouldn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10027.69s">That's</a> the answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10029.412s">We</a> used $1.75 million in free cash to plug the budget with the understanding that we would have an override coming up on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10040.379s">I</a> think what my colleague is saying is that we should do that <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10044.041s">another</a> year and then do an override the next year or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10048.262s">But</a> it's, I'm honestly a bit confused why it keeps coming up as a solution to all of our problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10055.585s">Cause</a> it's not like you just can't use free cash year after year for salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10061.486s">That's</a> not the way it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=10063.087s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11455.848s">Let's</a> move on.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=11459.33s">We</a> still have a City Council meeting to go to.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12478.72s">Now,</a> Councilor Collins said a lot of points that I was going to make, which is to get the bird's eye view. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12486.546s">Most</a> of this council is pretty, is fairly new. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12489.508s">About</a> half of us are in our first term. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12493.231s">And</a> so we are trying to lay the foundations for the further growth and development of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12500.336s">The</a> most important thing, the most important component of that is the zoning overhaul. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12506.232s">a</a> couple of meetings ago, I brought up a linkage fee proposal which would essentially raise the fees that developers pay for the first time to the city for their developments for the first time in 30 years that passed this council six to one. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12521.824s">I</a> think that you'll find that we are intensely focused on the financials so that we will have growth for the next 10 years, for the next 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12532.312s">In</a> general, this city, <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12536.278s">a</a> lot of the political history of this city has been sort of attempting to kick the can down the road or just say, oh, or just come up with like vague ways to say, oh, we should all come together and find solutions, but not actually ever backing anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12551.79s">This</a> council is actually laying the foundations and passing actual ordinances and legislation so that we won't have to worry about that in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12563.379s">So</a> yes, we are building a foundation that should have been built a very long time ago, and these overrides are really meant to address more short-term concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=12573.108s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13410.931s">So</a> speaking a bit more of a bird's eye view of this, I do wish that things were better between the fire union and the mayor and that that process had gone better for both parties. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13426.218s">And</a> I am sorry at how that has evolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13429.5s">My</a> view of this is that <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13433.078s">even</a> is that the debt exclusion is about funding and it's not, I don't see it as necessarily being tied to whatever plans come out. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13443.166s">That's</a> just how I view it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=13446.849s">So</a> that.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14169.056s">I'm</a> going to try to give more of a personal perspective of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14175.081s">It's</a> a good question, one that hasn't been directly addressed in these chambers too much. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14179.085s">I</a> think, honestly, what we're seeing here is a bit of a generational divide. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14185.65s">So</a> I think that previous generations of politicians quite literally came from a different part of town. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14196.069s">I've</a> literally analyzed this myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14197.53s">I</a> put up a blog post about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14198.831s">And</a> so there's a lot of people in the city who are used to having this personal relationship with their elected officials, because they're literally the people that they grew up with. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14209.037s">But</a> over time, the demographics of Medford have shifted. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14214.96s">You</a> have a much younger generation of voters, a lot more people moving in. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14220.324s">And</a> so there's a, <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14223.26s">And</a> so most, I mean, most of the city Councilors these days live in just literally a completely different geographical part of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14231.411s">And</a> so I've spoken to, you know, there's been a lot of angry meetings and there is like some folks who've come up and said, you know, very <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14239.918s">unpleasant</a> things to me, who I've later had very good one-on-one conversations with, and they've said, well, Matt, people are scared. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14248.006s">And</a> I do think that in some cases that is the case, because they feel like they don't really know, at a personal level, some of the folks here, just because we do come <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14264.611s">we</a> are like literally living in a different part of town. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14267.852s">Um,</a> so I think that, I think that these sorts of things will heal, um, will heal over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14274.693s">Um,</a> I think it's a matter of, I'm trying to figure out like who, uh, that comes to these meetings is willing to have a nice one-on-one conversation, develop those relationships. <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=14284.515s">Not</a> everybody is, but some people are, so it will heal with time is my take on that.<h2><a href="../2024-10-16_aYgKtMphc2E/2024-10-16_aYgKtMphc2E.html">City Council 10-15-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=639.707s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=640.928s">So,</a> when I first in the time before, and I ran for council in the time that I was running one thing that I learned is that there are <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=653.123s">a</a> lot of people in the city who hold politics above personal relationships. <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=659.949s">Because</a> when I said that I'm running as a progressive, those are my ideals. <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=666.895s">And</a> then you end up making a decision that maybe some person doesn't like, you kind of notice that there's a lot of folks in the city who will turn on you after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=677.685s">And</a> that's happened <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=679.787s">to</a> me quite a few times with relationships that I've had with various folks around the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=686.672s">I've</a> noticed that Larry was one of the few people who truly did not matter to him. <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=695.817s">There's</a> a few other people like that where you could tell it's just whatever happens politically, whatever happens in the chambers, it just doesn't <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=708.223s">matter</a> to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=710.144s">They'll</a> always value their relationship. <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=712.725s">They'll</a> always value who you are as a human being above all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=716.986s">They</a> really know how to remain neutral and respect the person. <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=724.829s">And</a> so it made me respect and miss him a lot more, even though I haven't known him as long as some of my colleagues had. <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=738.51s">gave</a> him a phone call, gave him a phone call over the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=742.153s">And</a> after he'd been hospitalized, talked for a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=745.796s">Remember,</a> I just asked him about the history of the, you know, Medford politics, because we're having some contentious meetings here. <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=754.824s">And</a> he said to me, Matt, it's always been that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=762.256s">So</a> this was a guy who, he'd been around the block a few times, and he knew that at the end of the day, it's the person that matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=770.484s">It's</a> none of this, all of this is ephemeral. <a href="https://youtu.be/aYgKtMphc2E&t=773.547s">So</a> I miss him.<h2><a href="../2024-10-10_m5uYjUemjGA/2024-10-10_m5uYjUemjGA.html">City Council Planning and Permitting Committee 10-09-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=927.982s">I</a> had a question on Medford's current definition of dormitories. <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=935.827s">And</a> I'm just trying to get an idea for myself of the practical cases where these different definitions would differ. <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=944.465s">Our</a> current one is building designed for or occupied as a residence for students or staff owned by or under the supervision of an institution or an educational use which is not operated as a gainful business. <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=958.168s">With</a> the wording for that, could that be understood as, could you like have an apartment complex or a house which is owned by an institution of some sort, even like a private equity firm, but ends up housing mostly students? <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=978.28s">Would</a> that be reclassified as dormitory under our current ordinances?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1178.478s">I</a> think my other concern with this definition is specified building designed by or occupied as a residence for students or staff so it's that <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1188.891s">It's</a> that or right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1189.971s">So</a> what I'm thinking is that one year it could be occupied by all renters who are working in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1198.574s">They</a> all move out and then a bunch of students move in there and suddenly it's reclassified as a dormitory automatically just because it might not have been designed for that purpose, but now they're occupied. <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1210.538s">It's</a> now occupied by them that you see what I'm saying there.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/m5uYjUemjGA&t=1260.414s">Yeah,</a> I'm just trying to understand how... I'm just trying to go over the implications of the current definition, just add food for thought for changing it in the future.

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2359.518s">Okay,</a> yeah, for I mean, yeah, for the for the stuff that's like right next to the mistook I could definitely see the argument for making that into mixed use one but for yeah for the rest of that area like I run around that kind of spot of that parcel land all the time and it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2376.207s">It's</a> very underutilized. <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2377.568s">There's</a> like two banks there. <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2378.569s">So</a> I think it absolutely makes sense to build higher properties there.

Which of the mixed use three versus mixed use four would developers normally be inclined to go for? <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2415.533s">Is</a> there a situation where we decide on one and then developers are like, well, I don't think it's worth it to do that, but they wouldn't do that for the other? <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2425.992s">What</a> I'm thinking of is like when we do pass one of these, would there be any difference in sort of estimated uptake of that?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2565.107s">So</a> just sorry, just just to summarize, like, so in theory, it sounded like that was kind of an implicit endorsement of option A, which is, you know, has more of the mixed use mixed use for which is sort of denser, but not quite as high. <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2580.393s">But</a> what you were just saying now is that developers were, they didn't in <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2587.02s">In</a> practice, they didn't really seem to care about the specific heights as much as the sort of depth of affordability when they were building housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2594.922s">When</a> they were building housing.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2670.304s">more.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2670.604s">So</a> follow up to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2671.725s">So</a> what all of the different rules and incentives that are, um, that make developers make these decisions? <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2679.247s">Would</a> those be baked into the zoning at the ordinance level? <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2682.468s">Or</a> would those be baked into rules that are sort of decided to staff level as a result of studies?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2739.025s">kind</a> of trying to avoid is that when, you know, all of this has passed, if we end up baking in some rules that end up being really difficult to change, it just end up not working, or that end up just discouraging development, and then would have to go back and sort of redo all this versus, you know, some of these incentive zoning programs that we're talking about that could potentially be changed, sort of more at the staff level after, you know, a consultant does a study on that.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=2807.957s">No,</a> no, I'd like to hear more about this subject, but I don't have any more specific questions.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4247.2s">Uh,</a> Councilor, let me, sorry, just a real, um, personal idiot check question on my part here. <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4254.005s">So,</a> I mean, with option with option, <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4257.97s">be</a> like, we would need incentive zoning, correct, to implement the other programs that we're talking about as part of our, as part of the zoning overhaul. <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4268.977s">So,</a> like, would, like, we would need this in, we would need kind of those incentives to build higher for, like, for implementing, like, a TDM program, for instance, or some kind of, some kind of green incentives. <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4286.208s">Is</a> that, <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4287.47s">And</a> so if we go with option A, that's just all out. <a href="https://youtu.be/zRypqjx_sS4&t=4290.382s">Is</a> that no?

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=495.274s">Councilor</a> Callahan.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=516.974s">Are</a> you recommending to start off this whole paragraph by saying the city is working very hard to address the rodent problem?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=550.805s">What</a> about overgrowth ordinance?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=586.996s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=589.258s">I</a> mean, they were sort of mixed into that one committee meeting, but I don't know.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=601.156s">There's</a> a lot of traffic today.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=623.268s">Can</a> you look up the, wait, what was the date of this committee meeting again? <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=625.871s">That's</a> Tuesday, September 17th. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=668.042s">I</a> mean, I think we did work on both of that committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=682.645s">I</a> believe if my memory serves right, so I could just say that.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=748.002s">Yeah,</a> my memory is like... <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=788.425s">Okay,</a> what was the, I'm just gonna go to another tab here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=814.432s">And</a> I was 17. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=817.521s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=823.104s">And</a> then we have the one in August. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=826.946s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=827.186s">That</a> was, that was the August 13th. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=830.107s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=858.513s">Councilor</a> Callahan.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=926.882s">Councilor</a> Tseng.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=935.351s">Sorry,</a> can you speak up?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=954.795s">My</a> brain's blinking a little bit here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=956.557s">What</a> is a good way to summarize all the discussions on the overgrowth and rodent control ordinances? <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=963.222s">Those</a> are, to be honest, those are kind of like mixing together at this point for me, between the wildlife feeding and the overgrowth and rodent control. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=994.624s">I</a> mean, the crossed out stuff isn't going to be... <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1020.407s">This</a> actually... This will ensure that residents don't feed on wildlife and only allow the city to step in if there is news. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1036.676s">In</a> a sense, it will help us reduce our issues with rats and other unwanted animals. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1045.261s">Additionally,</a> I'm just going to say, <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1061.115s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1064.577s">And</a> then again, I'm going, once I actually format this, I'm just going to blow it up with links to the actual drafts of the ordinances themselves, which is half the purpose of this thing to begin with. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1078.287s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1079.528s">It's</a> a bit of a bit of a long paragraph, but it basically summarizes that the public health and community safety committee is trying to work on the rodent issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1093.297s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1094.718s">Justin,</a> how close are you to City Hall?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1145.268s">Trying</a> to think of, I could just say mini constitution, but this is analogous to a constitution.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1163.195s">Anna</a> might have an idea.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1234.648s">City</a> Charters, the Charters. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1245.81s">I</a> should say finalizes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1251.952s">City</a> Charters, the Governor. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1253.432s">All</a> right, Councilor Tseng has just entered the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1278.855s">Alright,</a> I like things in lists of three but I'm having trouble thinking of something besides this as an example of what the charter covers. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1298.27s">Cool.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1418.655s">Yeah,</a> that this is, I mean, it was, I think, I think this is work on the charter is probably going to be covered pretty extensively in future newsletters. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1427.861s">And</a> this is really meant, I mean, really all that happened is that's fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1431.784s">Now</a> we <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1432.85s">there</a> was a resolution that was referred directly to committee.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1449.623s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1533.753s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1534.753s">I</a> was thinking maybe finalize this recommendations or finalize its drafts.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1554.855s">Um,</a> clarify Councilor, is Councilor Scarpelli here? <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1559.698s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1572.625s">Um,</a> I'm going to go ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1576.327s">And,</a> um, is there any other parts of the newsletter that folks would like to comment on? <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1583.915s">I</a> think that we need to go over. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1586.296s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1595.379s">In</a> that case, is there any public, is there any public participation in this matter? <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1601.021s">There's</a> nobody currently in the chamber, but there are some folks on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1605.542s">So</a> if you'd like to offer input onto this current draft of the <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1613.433s">under</a> this current draft of the newsletter, feel free. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1615.495s">In</a> that case, do we have a motion on the floor? <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1623.802s">Motion</a> approves it for publication. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1626.344s">I</a> have a motion to approve for publication by Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1630.827s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1633.73s">Seconded</a> by Councilor Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1640.08s">I</a> did see iPhone on Zoom, but I'm not seeing it anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1644.903s">So</a> I don't think Councilor Scarpelli is on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1649.106s">So</a> we can just do a voice vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1652.728s">All</a> those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1653.428s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1654.489s">All</a> those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1655.83s">Motion</a> passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1659.792s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1660.873s">We'll</a> get this formatted and hold on. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1668.137s">did</a> have a note from Zoom reminding members to turn their mics on when they talk just so that it can be, just so that everybody can hear them that's listening in and for the recording. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1683.307s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1685.588s">Now,</a> 24370 offered by Councilor Tseng, a resolution to create a residence guide to City Council's procedures and processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1695.731s">So</a> I have the draft that Councilor Tseng shared. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1702.036s">And</a> again, apologies that this is not, this was not in the initial agenda, but folks put in some work over the weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1717.568s">And</a> if that is, all right, seems to be good. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1722.452s">Councilor</a> Tseng.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1793.0s">Just</a> one that comes to mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1795.582s">It</a> says that we pass <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1799.147s">resolutions</a> right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1800.287s">I</a> think, or sorry, we pass ordinances right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1802.388s">I</a> think that some, the use of the word resolution is also, would also be good just to kind of include right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1809.691s">Like</a> we pass resolutions, then an explanation of what that is, ordinances, and zoning regulations.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1856.123s">Councilor</a> Cownie.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=1946.172s">Councilor</a> Lazzaro.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2153.206s">just</a> to follow up on that, there always is a balance that needs to be struck with these kinds of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2163.772s">And</a> I don't think that we can write, I don't think we can write anything down on a piece of paper that will work for every single person. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2179.922s">What</a> I think would happen is, <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2182.851s">matter</a> what we end up approving in this committee, it'll go out and then people, some people will really help out. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2190.614s">I</a> think overall do very good, but people will also start to come to us with like problems with like, I had no idea what I was talking about here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2198.117s">And</a> over time, we'll get real world feedback from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2201.479s">So</a> it could be a process whereby we could go back and <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2204.68s">update</a> it later. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2205.581s">So</a> that's a way to say that I completely agree with everything that Councilor Lazzaro said. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2212.049s">I</a> am not opposed to releasing an imperfect product because I don't think that, I think that any discussions we have here <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2223.646s">we'll</a> just end up becoming theoretical and the best feedback we'll get is if we release something and then people use it and then bring that to us over time so we could release a version two, you know, after a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2239.546s">That's</a> my thoughts on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2240.928s">Councilor</a> Callahan.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2278.24s">Councilor</a> Tseng.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2373.437s">Councilor</a> Lazzaro.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2418.181s">Yeah,</a> I think this would need to be referred to, I think a good way to form that motion would be to, <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2427.706s">Um</a> move this for approval to the regular council subject to the edits that we've given to Councilor Tseng this session. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2437.933s">Before</a> we do that, I just wanted to ask, is there any public participation? <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2443.077s">I</a> see we have some folks on Zoom who might want to offer input on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2448.801s">Alright,</a> I'm not seeing any raised hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2453.003s">Oh,</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2453.744s">Oh,</a> we have Eileen <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2457.25s">Learner</a> on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2458.835s">Hold</a> on a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2461.282s">Yep,</a> I have to unmute.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2497.794s">So</a> I think, I believe that Councilor Tseng, we saw your comment in the chat and I believe Councilor Tseng just said that he would add something to the participation rules about the fact that we will have a sign up sheet and typically do. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2517.489s">It's</a> just our, we don't have a city messenger at the moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2522.492s">So</a> that might've been why this particular draft <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2527.765s">didn't</a> include that.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2548.073s">Councilor</a> Tseng? <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2549.874s">Okay,</a> yep. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2551.434s">Justin</a> just said that he <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2554.535s">Justin</a> just said that he added it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KYii5qaeea0&t=2555.756s">So</a> the version that we refer to the regular council meeting will have will tell people explicitly that they can sign up to participate and don't have to wait in line.

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2033.303s">Yeah,</a> I understand that there are residents across the street, but it's also not, I mean, Riverside Avenue is a fairly large road, and we did approve the special permit for Pinky's Pizza, which is a lot more of a closed-in neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2051.874s">So</a> I just, yeah, I think 1 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2055.996s">in</a> this case does make sense, just given the location. <a href="https://youtu.be/9UBBIuMHGIQ&t=2059.778s">That's</a> my two cents.

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1159.998s">It</a> does. <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1161.639s">Is</a> there any other mechanisms that you've seen, you've heard about people using in other municipalities besides ticketing that just, that could work better? <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1173.048s">Because</a> I often hear about enforcement of ordinances being an ongoing issue, especially with limited staffing capabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1181.695s">So</a> if you've given any, if you've sort of heard about other instances of <a href="https://youtu.be/k65YPGeaIcs&t=1188.379s">municipalities</a> that are able to enforce what they do have, and would love to hear about that.

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=1977.67s">Thank</a> you for the presentation, Paola. <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=1981.712s">So</a> the question I have is that we have a couple of programs that are proposed on our wish list, which sort of relate to zoning incentives. <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=1992.578s">So</a> I've been pushing for the transportation demand management program to be implemented in <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=1998.968s">some</a> forms that we could get developers more involved in the regional TMAs. <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2004.211s">I've</a> also, but there's also other aspects to this, like an inclusion, like affordable housing overlays and a few other programs that could affect, that could affect a developer's decision to build, <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2022.578s">to</a> build housing, like the linkage program they were discussing last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2025.779s">I</a> guess my question is, in the other cities that you've been studying, do they normally have a bunch of different incentive programs overlaid with each other that are integrated, or is it normally better to keep it more or less simple?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2201.861s">personally</a> speaking, my end all be all is Medford does need more affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2207.882s">So</a> whatever our zoning can do to disincentivize developers from building luxury units and to integrate more affordable housing and to make that more profitable for them would be ideal and whatever the best mechanism to do that is, I would support. <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2227.066s">I</a> would also, though, like programs that <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2231.087s">incentivize</a> developers who come into Medford to sort of be more integrated into what's happening in the surrounding communities, just so that we're not so isolated. <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2242.078s">And</a> that's why I'm pushing for the TDM to be an important part of the ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2248.725s">So</a> that's where I'm coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2250.147s">And</a> then the third <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2254.321s">thing</a> on my Christmas list is to make it so that it's not some, all of these rules put together are not some Byzantine kind of overly complex structure that developers can't really understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/COIKCqnQvjE&t=2268.368s">So</a> I understand that that could end up getting a little bit contradictory after a while, but it's sort of those three things are what's on my mind right now.<h2><a href="../2024-09-11_qU-78lPQllo/2024-09-11_qU-78lPQllo.html">City Council 09-10-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3665.755s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3886.723s">Thank</a> you, Council President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3889.625s">So</a> this is the result of a lot of discussions that I've been having with the Office of Community Development as we try to <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3902.655s">update</a> the linkage program, the capital improvements program. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3906.978s">So</a> this is essentially when developers come in to the city, they need to pay fees into certain buckets, which will help to improve the city as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3919.547s">What</a> we're trying to do with this program is first to update the original amounts that were proposed in 1990 when this was established. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3926.612s">and</a> we're also trying to add a fifth bucket in addition to the ones already mentioned in the letter for affordable housing to provide a more constant source of revenue to the affordable housing trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3938.659s">We</a> previously discussed changes to the ordinance at earlier meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3943.962s">The</a> issue is that <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3945.083s">some</a> of the changes that we're proposing after legal review, it turns out you would need to go back to the state to actually update those in a couple of ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3955.091s">So</a> in order to actually do these updates every <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3962.256s">three</a> years as is required by that ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3966.138s">One</a> study to do that could cost as much as $150,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3968.7s">And</a> so doing that every three years is too cost prohibitive. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3973.702s">Just</a> performing the nexus study to establish a new bucket entirely for the affordable housing trust would probably cost about $80,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3981.667s">The</a> planning department has been going around trying to find consultants who are willing to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3988.31s">Medford</a> has a bit of a unique linkage program. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3991.972s">you</a> know, they are having trouble finding a consultant for a reasonable price that can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=3997.135s">So</a> what this would do first is it would just extend that to save the city a little bit of money because the full linkage program really wouldn't update that much within a three year period that you would actually need to do that study. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4010.422s">10</a> years is a more reasonable timeframe to do these. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4014.884s">We've</a> gone 34 years without doing one. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4018.166s">So</a> I think getting away from that three year mark is reasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4022.547s">And</a> the second, which is very important, is literally just copied and pasted from a similar program that Watertown did in <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4031.372s">2022,</a> where instead of just having these linkage prices set and just consistently get undervalued by inflation at the same time, there will be automatic updates from year to year so that the city is not losing money over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4045.643s">And,</a> you know, the less that we do, if we happen to have, you know, staff or boards who just <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4053.291s">don't</a> do what they're supposed to do and perform these studies every few years, we would just be losing money over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4060.217s">So</a> again, it's a fairly simple update, but it does need to go to the state for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4066.923s">So</a> I would motion to approve this home rule petition and send it to the mayor.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4240.811s">The</a> linkage funds are for? <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4242.332s">No,</a> the linkage funds don't go to the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4244.133s">It</a> listed in the letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4246.095s">So,</a> okay, so this is- Water, sewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4252.426s">Yeah,</a> so it's the police department, parks and rec, roads and traffic, water and sewers.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4262.273s">Yeah,</a> the authorizing legislation kind of gave a list of buckets that it could potentially go into, and affordable housing was one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4269.419s">But</a> when they actually implemented it in 1990, they only chose those four.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4354.52s">Yeah,</a> this would just allow for, this would just allow those automatic inflation based updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4361.167s">And</a> so it's a very specific, it's a very specific price index that's stated in the proposed change. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4369.436s">And</a> this was already done over in Watertown. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4372.419s">So</a> it is becoming standardized. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=4374.401s">neighboring</a> cities, it would also save the city money by expanding the requirement to actually do these studies from three to 10 years, because these studies are pretty cost intensive.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=5797.787s">So</a> moved.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6056.584s">So</a> when determining whether or not something will get through the state house, oftentimes you're reading the tea leaves. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6063.691s">But</a> in this case, it was solely because they had already approved similar language with that same price index for the city of Watertown. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6071.76s">So</a> they <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6074.122s">the</a> state legislature would want consistency going on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6077.626s">There</a> wouldn't really be much of a reason for the city of Watertown to go for one price index and then Medford to just arbitrarily choose another. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6086.257s">So</a> that's the justification behind that particular choice right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6094.847s">In</a> terms of the Affordable Housing Trust, as Council President Bears said, that is independent of any votes that took place tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6101.41s">This</a> was solely, the vote here was solely to ask the state to extend the period between these very expensive studies from three years to 10 years to save the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6113.334s">a</a> little bit of money, and also to allow for automatic adjustments to be applied for these, because right now, I think that when they instituted this, they assumed that the cities would just do these studies every three years, and Medford in practice just never did that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6127.016s">We're</a> supposed to, we never did. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6129.437s">So</a> this just allows a mechanism to prevent that, those fees from being eaten up by inflation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6135.678s">Right</a> now they're worth less than half of what they were in 1990. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6142.359s">The</a> affordable housing trust fund, sorry, the affordable housing trust linkage program. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6148.101s">So</a> that is, there is currently a draft that essentially establishes a fifth bucket in addition to the four that currently exist to go into the affordable housing trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6158.365s">The</a> affordable housing trust was already created by this council in the previous term. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6163.487s">And</a> the state, the language of the state ordinance also allows for <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6170.63s">also</a> allows for affordable housing to be one of those buckets. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6173.812s">So</a> essentially all the ordinance would do is create a chain there that puts money into the bucket. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6184.698s">The</a> thing is that in order to do that, you do need another completely new study, which would cost about $80,000 in order to figure out what exactly the amount of money that you're charging developers to go into the Affordable Housing Trust would be in the first place. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6201.131s">And</a> right now, I've been working with the planning office to figure out how to fund that study, what the study would look like, and just generally corresponding with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6211.26s">In</a> all likelihood, we wouldn't actually pass the ordinance until the study were conducted. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6218.727s">And</a> so, you know, we would have a bit more of a basis for it, but I could talk for a while about the whole situation there.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6286.889s">So</a> the point of doing these studies is that this can be looked at holistically. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6292.113s">The</a> reason that we're not just <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6295.995s">The</a> reason that you don't just kind of arbitrarily come up with a number is because those situations might occur in the first place. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6302.519s">Right</a> now, the planning office is trying to come up with funding to do a more comprehensive study on the other four buckets as well, just so that these situations don't actually happen, because you're right, you do need to account for a lot of other things, including what the city is already doing, the current costs of materials, labor, <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6323.551s">et</a> cetera, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6324.472s">And</a> so that is the purpose of doing one of these, uh, one of these studies in the first place. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6329.796s">Again,</a> the city hasn't done one in 34 years, so we really need to do one. <a href="https://youtu.be/qU-78lPQllo&t=6333.738s">Okay.</a> <h2><a href="../2024-08-14_j7cOY__Bzdc/2024-08-14_j7cOY__Bzdc.html">City Council 08-14-24</a></h2>

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9136.555s">No,</a> I just, I am just... <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9140.981s">I</a> guess my point was first, I just wanted to know purely technically if there is any extra information that could be gotten from the council resolution that could not be obtained from a FOIA request. <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9153.328s">And</a> also just submitting a simple FOIA request on your own and then publishing the results of that when it was received, which would effectively get a lot of information out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9165.776s">It</a> could be just as an effective means <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9168.698s">transparency.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9171.079s">Obviously,</a> that wouldn't be the case if the answer to the first question was yes, there are certain documents that can be received. <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=9177.161s">But</a> that was that was what I was asking.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=10185.385s">Oh.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=10918.606s">Thank</a> you, Council President Harris, for putting this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=10922.128s">So</a> I will be supporting the resolution, though one thing about it that I would like to point out is that there are sort of two... <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=10936.545s">The</a> advocacy for putting this particular one on this particular question on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=10942.207s">There</a> were two. <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=10945.528s">There</a> were two sort of groups of advocates that were trying to get it through one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=10952.902s">One</a> group was basically trying to make it so that anybody could grow these sorts of medicines for personal use and it would be less regulated. <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=10965.024s">The</a> other, which ended up being the question that we're seeing on the ballot with the sort of regulatory body is very similar to what is currently seen in Oregon, whereby you have a, <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=10982.193s">body,</a> an unelected commission that essentially does allow for people to use these medicines, but it generally puts a very high price on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=10997.278s">So</a> it turns it into a for-profit, it turns it into a for-profit industry. <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=11003.56s">So</a> I will be supporting it. <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=11006.721s">I</a> think that any <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=11010.924s">Any</a> progress is good. <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=11014.287s">Although</a> I will be pointing out that it is slightly different from the same resolution that this body supported several months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=11025.034s">So</a> thank you once again for your efforts.

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1976.354s">Thank</a> you, Vice President Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1979.795s">So</a> the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee has primarily met on the first, we had a committee meeting on the Human Rights Commission reform. <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=1996.152s">which</a> was the, which reflects the efforts of Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2001.896s">We</a> designed a social media policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2005.258s">A</a> lot of our efforts went into the modernizing City Council communication strategy. <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2012.823s">Social</a> media policy was designed by, I believe it was Councilor Tseng and <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2018.146s">Lazzaro,</a> a lot of our efforts in modernizing the communication strategy has just been in developing new routine habits to get information out to the public, namely the <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2037.546s">newsletter,</a> which we're drafting and releasing every month. <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2042.608s">So</a> there've been a couple of administrative challenges in terms of building a mailing list for that and working out the relationship between the administration and city council and releasing those to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2057.972s">But</a> we, at this point, we're going to be drafting the third newsletter tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2062.734s">And</a> I think we have a pretty smooth routine going. <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2068.11s">The</a> other aspect of modernizing communication strategy is the fact that these meetings are now being live streamed to YouTube, which was kind of more of a something that I worked with the clerk's office behind the scenes on to <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2090.805s">to</a> get that to happen, kind of like did a lot of chasing down of some of accounts and whatnot to figure out how to put that together. <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2102.779s">The</a> other aspect of this that we have been working on is meeting with underrepresented groups, namely the listening sessions that were proposed by Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2117.384s">We</a> have had a subcommittee meeting on that in which we designated which councilors are going to be responsible for which underrepresented groups in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2127.267s">Thus</a> far, we've had two listening sessions, one with <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2132.19s">the</a> senior center, which was organized by Councilor Lazzaro, the other with the <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2142.332s">Portuguese</a> liaisons, which I facilitated and which was attended by myself and Councilor Callahan last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2150.637s">Those</a> have gone very well in terms of just getting outside feedback from, you know, folks that are not usually engaging with City Council and City Hall as much as we'd like. <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2166.146s">Otherwise,</a> the <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2169.682s">Something</a> there's the project outside of this that we have that's gone through the committee has been a veterans housing initiative so that's not on the governing agenda, but it did come up in response to. <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2183.533s">the</a> project the veteran services director wanted to spearhead. <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2191.057s">And</a> so that's currently going through a legal process behind the scenes, kind of like figuring out how that interacts with public appropriations law. <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2201.182s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2203.919s">Yeah,</a> one of the one of the challenges of this committee is that it's more about it has a lot of ongoing projects so we're never going to stop streaming to YouTube hopefully we're never going to stop releasing a newsletter so it's just about creating more. <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2220.103s">transparency</a> and engagement habits within city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2223.805s">So</a> we can't really check any one of these off, uh, in a project based fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2229.748s">It's</a> just like a, there's just a lot of ongoing things that we're going to be doing in continuity. <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2234.77s">So</a> that is, there is a bit of a capacity problem with like a capacity issue with this particular committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2242.334s">Um,</a> so thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2244.134s">That's</a> all I got.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/scCLE7L4cnI&t=2955.323s">Yes.</a>

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=409.554s">Well,</a> yeah, okay, so it looks like that was our in the latest updates from Council President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=417.901s">It</a> looks like he already struck that out and replaced it with.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=487.666s">And</a> are you seeing the changes that I made? <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=490.028s">Is</a> this fine with you?

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=532.283s">Yeah,</a> with the final PDF, why it would end up being formatted, I'm not 100% sure about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=545.713s">But</a> I do agree, this generally does make it more readable. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=551.229s">This</a> is helpful.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=587.095s">What</a> date was that? <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=588.077s">OK,</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=623.826s">And</a> I do remember what exactly the date was that we met with the.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=677.927s">It</a> could be a good idea to just briefly summarize what was discussed or just state that we did it.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=701.32s">Yeah,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=701.68s">I</a> always write things in a very boring way, so let me know if- <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=705.922s">like</a> these two are, you know, sufficiently descriptive.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=731.539s">Yeah,</a> I was actually, and and I were kind of talking about how to present how to present that so I was, I mean, we like I did take notes from them, I was kind of thinking that maybe. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=746.756s">some</a> kind of a quarterly report on it, but we were sort of thinking like, okay, you know, do residents see these listening sessions as being semi-confidential? <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=756.901s">Like,</a> do they not want notes of what they talked about to be public record? <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=760.763s">So</a> I think that those things would need to be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=764.304s">It</a> would definitely be a good agenda item to bring up formally for the next resident services meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=770.747s">I'm</a> not sure if we would have time or be able to discuss it extensively <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=775.612s">this</a> particular meeting because it's not on the agenda, but maybe we could.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=807.241s">Councilor</a> Calderon.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=883.242s">Yeah,</a> no, I mean this, it is it is definitely something and I was also kind of thinking like that this would actually come up in the next agenda item because some of the stuff that we did here at the listening sessions would be relevant to the city guide that we're talking about, but I do agree that having it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=900.876s">be</a> discussed and sort of like the ideas like sort of codified and shared with the rest of the council is definitely gets to the spirit of those listening sessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=914.402s">To</a> the <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=916.289s">newsletter.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=917.449s">Is</a> there any other, and again, I apologize for some of the last minute updates, but the goal with these is to summarize the most recent events leading up to the current meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=930.474s">Is</a> there any other feedback that individual, that Councilors have about the current draft of the newsletter that you'd like to see?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=954.156s">Really,</a> oh, oh. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=955.196s">Yeah,</a> that's why we've been kind of. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=956.797s">Oh,</a> okay, okay, I did not, sorry, I didn't know that, okay, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=964.761s">Sorry,</a> I was so to be clear about the process for doing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=969.326s">I</a> have Google documents that I share with the individual Councilors who need to who are drafting that current one. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=978.415s">I</a> did not know that people who just view these things don't actually see the current edits Councilor Lazzaro.

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1255.017s">Move.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1256.018s">We</a> have a motion on the floor on the motion by Councilor Tseng seconded by Councilor Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1263.828s">Madam</a> Clerk, will you please call the roll.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1278.277s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1280.519s">4</a> in the affirmative, 1 absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1283.662s">Motion</a> passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1285.463s">Moving</a> on. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1286.224s">24-370</a> offered by Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1292.91s">Resolution</a> to create a residence guide to City Council's procedures and processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1302.844s">be</a> it resolved that the Resident Services Public Engagement Committee create and publish a short guide in English and commonly spoken non-English languages to the City Council for residents to understand the City Council's procedures and processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1316.397s">I</a> imagine this could just be a general discussion of our ideas of what this should contain. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1321.221s">Are</a> there any comments on the floor? <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1325.305s">Councilor</a> Tseng.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1463.843s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1466.465s">Councilor</a> Lazzaro.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1589.471s">So</a> to summarize what I've heard, people generally like the idea of having a short one page for people to go through, but with the possibility of having supplementary documents that explain in more detail what the different rules and processes are, the having something just right at the top for people who've literally never been to city council meetings before, and just like very quick, <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1618.592s">like</a> quick and dirty sort of points like, you know, when we take a vote, why there's not necessarily public participation there, as well as basic info about what the city council is in charge of and what falls under purview of other departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1640.279s">In</a> terms of format, I mean, I, I think it would be a good idea to have a one pager and like you see that little plastic thing right there where they have agendas out. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1650.447s">So</a> just have something like that sitting out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1652.609s">So</a> it would be a good idea since this will be printed to have everything in black and white. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1657.273s">So</a> try to not like, and this is just my initial take, try not like indulge too much in like super colorful graphics, but just kind of keep like a very <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1665.748s">basic</a> presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1667.089s">The</a> important thing would be to have it done in multiple languages. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1674.035s">Not</a> that we don't have to have graphics or anything, but just make it so that it looks reasonable when you print it off on a laser printer. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1681.721s">That's</a> the other piece of feedback I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1684.543s">But</a> I do agree that a nice one pager for people who come in here have never attended a meeting before and can just kind of like take that as something to hold would be <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1693.863s">very,</a> would be a very nice thing.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1719.525s">Leading</a> up to this meeting, I actually was thinking that having a nice, colorful graphics-based thing would be a really cool product to show people. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1727.172s">But</a> I'm also thinking about practicality. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1730.154s">When</a> people come to a city council meeting, it's often in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1733.557s">And</a> I've heard a lot of people say, this is my first city council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1736.88s">I</a> have no idea what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1738.902s">And</a> when we get these agenda packets, <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1743.926s">very</a> often, and this is something that I even mentioned last night, the PDFs are sort of like very nice looking, very presentable, very colorful. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1754.672s">But</a> when they're printed, and again, this is just like a super practical issue, it just doesn't translate well into black and white. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1762.076s">And</a> that will be the reality of residents that are actually holding this guide. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1766.898s">So</a> I think simplicity is
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1818.146s">There's</a> a movie that I saw a clip of one time as well, where it discussed the process of designing a new type of tank within the Pentagon. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1830.214s">And</a> throughout the design process, different generals kept on giving their different pieces of input to the design of this thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1837.559s">And</a> the end product was something that had been completely designed by committee and was like, like totally impractical. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1845.885s">So</a> I do think that <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1848.446s">there</a> is that element of that in making this as well.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1865.609s">My</a> point in saying that is that we are giving these suggestions and I have my own opinions on this, but you know, you know, you're the, you're the artist, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1879.051s">You</a> know, I think it's important.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1890.195s">That</a> is true. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1890.776s">We're</a> discussing what's essentially an artistic project and we don't have the one artist on city council on this committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1896.098s">So</a> there, I could see some issues with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1902.898s">But</a> no, that is to say we are making these suggestions, but it is important to filter through what is the most essential information for someone who has no idea what's going on, try to put that front and center. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1915.324s">The</a> goal of this is that if somebody's entering these chambers, <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1919.215s">They</a> don't know anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1922.738s">They</a> can read this piece of paper and get the 411 and oftentimes having too much information in one place could end up not being beneficial for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=1935.37s">Councilor</a> Lazzaro.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2011.626s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2014.588s">Is</a> there a color printer in this building?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2094.641s">So</a> I do, with Anna's suggestion, <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2099.956s">I</a> am inclined to think so having, starting out with like a city council guide that looks clean, smooth, one pager would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2107.823s">And</a> then probably expanding to having something out front for that, you know, if we have like a nice city council one, we could also then do a general city hall one, which may be, okay, this is your first time in city hall, if you are a, <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2124.716s">small</a> business owner, go to this department on this floor, you can talk to this person and something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2131.262s">But</a> I, so there should be room to be able to scale it to other departments, but the initial model, just to keep the project simple, I feel like, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2147.264s">don't,</a> you know, we just started out by knowing what our scope is and just getting the first guide right. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2154.23s">And</a> then after that, after that, expanding to that, that's my opinion.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2269.711s">Yeah,</a> makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2271.832s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2273.271s">Personally,</a> with the survey, I think having a draft first, I think it would be more effective to have a draft and then put that out and ask for feedback on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2285.299s">This</a> is just kind of my initial thoughts on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2288.822s">And</a> then say, is this helpful to you? <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2290.723s">Please</a> give us feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2291.704s">And</a> then update it from there just so that people sort of have an idea of what you're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2297.947s">That's</a> just my thinking on that though. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2300.269s">So</a> it would, again, you're the artist. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2303.612s">So</a> don't let me, I'm not gonna tell Van Gogh what shade of yellow to use in the process.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2380.07s">Councilor</a> Callaghan, tell us your thoughts right now.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2397.3s">Everybody</a> in this packed room is waiting for your thoughts.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2405.666s">Sorry,</a> I was too busy making jokes. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2408.708s">On</a> the best way to get feedback for the guide from residents, the discussion was... No, that's cool.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2465.691s">I</a> feel like if we're kind of looking at, I don't think that there would be much of an issue with <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2472.597s">you</a> as an individual, as you're coming up with like an initial draft for this, posting this to one of your accounts just to get some feedback from folks and then bringing it to the body, which, and I'm mainly saying that just because that possibly would be a way to <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2499.75s">speed</a> up the process and not have to like, you know, vote a vote, a draft of something out of a meeting and then get approval from the general body. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2510.433s">So</a> I'm just trying to think of ways to kind of simplify the process of drafting a one pager here.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2559.653s">Yeah,</a> cool. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2561.795s">In</a> terms of future directions, we did receive a, I mean, just because we said we were going to talk about this on the last agenda item, we did receive some feedback from some folks that are listening sessions who are saying that, you know, they go into city hall, they don't know <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2583.803s">like</a> where to go from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2586.065s">So</a> I know that we're talking about solely a city council, one pager guide for residents, but scaling, like moving forward, it would be good to have, it would be good to, you know, at least start thinking about, you know, if somebody literally enters the building and they wanna talk to someone about getting a license, then having something right there for them to, <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2611.827s">look</a> at maybe having a greeter if that's a thing that City Hall has capacity for like I don't know the equivalent of a receptionist just right in the middle of City Hall would be a nice nice thing to have as soon as we <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2631.641s">get</a> the funding for something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2633.062s">But</a> anyway, those are just some informal notes from our listening sessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2646.084s">Is</a> there any further discussion on this agenda item?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2718.828s">Yep,</a> on the one pager. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2723.308s">It's</a> very, very controversial motion Councilor Tseng, do we have a, do we have a second on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2733.031s">We</a> have two. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2734.851s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2745.075s">Well,</a> before we vote, do we have any public participation? <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2750.576s">Anybody</a> interested in public participation? <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2755.657s">Okay,</a> seeing none in the chambers and none on Zoom, we'll go ahead and call the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2764.003s">Roll</a> call.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2767.605s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2773.189s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2776.071s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2778.233s">Four</a> present, wait, four in favor, one absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2782.916s">The</a> motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2786.611s">Motion</a> to adjourn. <a href="https://youtu.be/RmvL56DRR5k&t=2788.352s">On</a> the motion to adjourn, seconded by Councilor, was that a second, Councilor Callahan?

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=540.274s">Just</a> like to say that <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=544.115s">When</a> I was a member of the CPA, Tom Lincoln, he was one of our frequent customers. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=552.56s">He</a> just brought in application after application to repair the Brooks Estate, and he's the driving force behind the upkeep of that property today. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=562.985s">This</a> is just a case of an <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=566.707s">ordinary</a> citizen of Medford, seeing something that they wanted preserved, seeing a project that they could really get behind, and putting their time and energy into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=577.116s">And</a> it's really paid off. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=578.777s">I</a> look forward to telling Mr. Lincoln how much I admire him when he does come to the next city council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=589.005s">Congratulations,</a> Mr. Lincoln. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=591.127s">You're</a> a great citizen. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=592.548s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=5939.871s">I'd</a> just like to say, it looks like you've assembled a real dream team here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=5945.857s">Thank</a> you very much for... No, I'm serious. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=5951.502s">I</a> looked through the descriptions of everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=5958.462s">I</a> know that I spent a lot of time just focusing on, you know, trying to find good people for the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=5964.406s">It</a> looks like everybody here is far, far more qualified than <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=5971.414s">when</a> it comes to anything related to affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=5975.156s">And</a> thank you so much for your efforts in assembling these six people. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=5981.658s">I</a> know that they'll do fantastic work. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=5987.1s">I</a> look forward to recommendations from these folks when it comes to both any affordable housing policy ideas and ways to get money into the trust fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=5998.904s">So</a> just, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=5999.824s">Thank</a> you for your efforts and that's all I got. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6002.795s">Vice</a> President Collins.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6270.642s">Just</a> wanted to say, I remember back when I was getting my appointment to the CPA, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6281.525s">I</a> remember I waited in this room until about one, one o'clock in the morning, watching a very good meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6291.111s">It</a> was a great meeting, but also just say that when I saw at his name on the, on the agenda, I was kind of thinking like, you know, I really don't want to have somebody else go through that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6303.539s">That's,</a> that's not, not always the, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6307.441s">most</a> pleasant thing to go through. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6308.681s">So</a> I was kind of behind the scenes asking folks to do that, to move this paper out of order just so that she didn't also have to wait till one in the morning to get appointed. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6321.206s">But</a> just wanted to say right over your resume, I think it's wonderful to have a social worker with heights of the community on the CPA and I know you'll do good work there. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6334.331s">So</a> yeah, that's all I got.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11254.315s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11254.556s">I</a> would just like to thank you for figures two and three, which very clearly show the amount that has been matched by the state every year since 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11263.88s">Um,</a> as well as figure three, which very clearly shows that historically they're 29% of CPA funds have gone towards affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11274.165s">I</a> would recommend modestly that maybe the color coding is could be updated because we get these in
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11283.09s">It</a> looks beautiful in the PDF. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11284.491s">It</a> looks absolutely wonderful, very clear in the online PDF. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11288.453s">But</a> I will say that just in the printed version, it's not quite clear that the state matching has been very consistent year to year, in spite of what has often been said in these chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=11300.62s">So</a> thank you very much for that.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12449.913s">So</a> just two questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12451.995s">So</a> to clarify, if somebody wanted to build an ADU on their house and they lived in a historic district, then you would require that the ADU be built with materials similar to the one that are used to currently construct the house?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12465.764s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12466.165s">The</a> other one, and I've kind of been curious about this ever since I first saw this map a couple of months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12473.42s">Could</a> you talk about the houses between, I believe it's 84 and 102, or are they just like newer buildings?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12498.186s">Oh,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12499.106s">Use</a> your arrow keys. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=12500.027s">You</a> can go back with the arrow key.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13970.862s">I</a> just have one question for the members of the Historic District Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13974.844s">When</a> you were deciding which district to choose for those, what other areas were you sort of considering? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=13983.49s">And</a> can you just delve a little bit more into the specific rationale for choosing South Street?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=14543.299s">I</a> feel like we need a bit more of an extensive presentation.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15171.179s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15841.854s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15842.674s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15845.66s">I</a> don't want to meditate too much on this, but I would like to clarify because I said that I talked to the administration about free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15854.486s">And</a> I want to clarify what I mean when I say that I talked to the administration is I Googled Bob Dickinson, the finance director's phone number, left him a voicemail, and then he got back to me and we talked for like, you know, half an hour about <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15869.736s">free</a> cash, because when I saw, you know, $9 million, I was kind of like, what's going on here? <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15874.598s">And</a> so then, you know, the finance director has been working in this area for years, and me, who, as an elected official, doesn't suddenly mean that I know everything about finance, I talked to him about it, I asked my questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15887.563s">And</a> he explained, you know, what the situation was, it's not a simple issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15893.306s">Cities</a> are kind of on a one year delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15895.146s">So</a> in many ways, we're dealing now with what was budgeted last year, and we are <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15899.008s">going</a> to be in our budget, and we're trying to predict what the budget will be next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15902.191s">They</a> always come up with conservative estimates. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15903.812s">Part</a> of the free cash comes from the fact that the police department couldn't hire 10 police officers, so that's $800,000 extra in free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15912.119s">Obviously,</a> if we want to be able to fill those positions, that is not revenue that we can expect to come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15918.525s">next</a> year. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15919.326s">Part</a> of it just came from poor, inaccurate estimations in previous years of what healthcare costs would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15925.473s">Those</a> things are always hard to predict. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15929.939s">And</a> part of this is the fact that we <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15933.263s">implement,</a> you know, we have these one time very big studies to try to invest in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15938.811s">Obviously,</a> we're debating many of those tonight costs like 15 million bucks to replace the HVAC systems for the middle school. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15946.381s">So</a> we need to, we need to spend, we need to <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15950.106s">fix</a> that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15951.628s">And</a> we can't just say, Oh, here's $9 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15953.85s">Well,</a> we should use that on salaries, continuing costs, which will just sink, which will just like eat up all of that money in a couple of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15964.34s">So,</a> you know, in order to appropriately finance the city, it's not <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15969.645s">It's</a> not an easy thing to explain, but at the end of the day, free cash goes to one-time costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15974.287s">You</a> cannot count on it as an ongoing source of revenue, especially to handle salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15979.61s">The</a> other thing to note is that being an elected official doesn't mean that people will suddenly make an effort to call me <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15992.717s">to</a> give me information and include me in on things. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=15995.398s">It's</a> my job to go out and seek that information and try to educate myself on things that happen, you know, just because, you know, being elected basically means that I get to sit in the seat and talk for however long I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16012.745s">I'm</a> allowed to, and vote on ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16018.489s">If</a> I was not involved in the financial task force in order to figure out how things work, any city councilor can do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16026.495s">You</a> call up somebody, you seek out that information, you build up those relationships, and if you choose not to do that, then you won't be included. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16034.181s">That's</a> just how it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16035.682s">So</a> I'd just like to clarify that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=16038.444s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19005.427s">Part</a> of this that gives me pause is the fact that Medford, the mayor's chair of the school committee and so I mean I know that that's two different positions but by two legally different positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19018.554s">I,</a> yeah, I, I know but the. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19024.183s">it</a> could change if the charter changes, but effectively the person who is occupying both the position as mayor and the position as head of the school committee in Medford are the same person. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19039.517s">And</a> so the chair of the school committee did get a raise already. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19047.964s">And</a> so that's, <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19050.649s">That's</a> I'd say that I'd say that that's the part that that's that's the one part of this that does give me that does give me some pause the logic of having not received an increase in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19062.985s">10</a> years, that does make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19066.329s">But</a> the person who is essentially doing the job that they have done that whole time has received a raise that we approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=19078.762s">So</a> that's the only part of this that I'm questioning right now.<h2><a href="../2024-06-16_7bxzQL-mir8/2024-06-16_7bxzQL-mir8.html">Medford's Ballot Questions</a></h2>
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=0.503s">Hello,</a> City Councilor Matt Leming here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=2.565s">I</a> just got back from a run so my face is a little bit redder than usual, but in this recap I'm going to go over a couple of very important events that just happened at the past City Council meeting and sort of get into some initial thoughts, nitty gritties on that and <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=26.523s">try</a> to answer a couple of the more common questions that I hear about these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=31.349s">So</a> at the last city council meeting, the work of a lot of colleagues of mine really came to fruition when we voted on three ballot measures that will appear on the ballot this November. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=45.411s">The</a> first of these is a $3.5 million Prop 2.0 override, which would, if passed, give $3 million to level fund the Medford Public Schools and basically make it so that they can continue operating at capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=61.842s">as</a> well as $500,000 to the Department of Public Works, which would go towards road and sidewalk improvements, let them hire inside more staff members to more actively maintain and repair the roads and sidewalks in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=78.658s">The</a> second is a $4 million Prop 2.0 override, which would invest in Medford Public Schools, in particular into their arts and vocational programs, and let them address salary issues with teachers and paraprofessionals. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=94.451s">So</a> the first one just would make it so that the Medford Public Schools can just stop treading water. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=102.337s">And</a> the second lets us really invest in our kids' education. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=106.58s">and</a> the third is a debt exclusion which is a temporary tax increase to build a new firefighter headquarters on 120 Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=119.29s">So</a> there's a lot that can be said about <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=124.018s">about</a> these overrides. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=124.939s">I'm</a> just going to try to use this video to just offer some answers to a lot of questions and sentiments that I hear a lot about these measures. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=137.147s">A</a> lot of this is just going to be information that I've already gone over in previous posts. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=144.314s">on</a> my website, but I'm trying to make this kind of a go-to simple page for some of the most obvious top-level stuff to be answered for people who are just trying to learn more information about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=157.665s">So,</a> first off, Proposition 2.5. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=159.927s">That</a> is a 1980 ballot measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=163.47s">that</a> essentially prevents cities from increasing the amount of money they take from property taxes by 2.5% in any given year, barring new growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=173.475s">So,</a> in other words, if you took in $100 million from property taxes one year, you're not allowed to take in more than $102.5 million in property taxes the next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=185.721s">The</a> problem with that is that inflation between 1980 and today averaged out to 3.08%, so that means that effectively the <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=193.495s">budget</a> of a given city goes down, the value of it goes down over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=201.904s">And</a> what that means is that cities can do basically one of three things. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=207.289s">The</a> first is they do an override, which over 300 of the 350 municipalities in Massachusetts have done so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=216.712s">of</a> the cities, I think Medford is one of like three or four that haven't so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=222.256s">Or</a> if you're like Cambridge or Somerville, you can invest in these massive commercial projects, which end up growing your commercial tax base a massive amount over a 20 year period. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=234.424s">The</a> third option is to do nothing and continue to cut costs and just sort of watch the infrastructure of a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=242.986s">city</a> deteriorate, which in many ways is kind of what Medford's done over the last couple of decades, which is sort of what's led us here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=255.094s">So</a> the Prop 2.5 override is a ballot measure that allows us to, for one year, ignore that 2.5% rule and raise the amount that we're allowed to take in more than 2.5% in a given year. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=269.703s">A</a> debt exclusion is the same thing, except it's temporary. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=272.044s">It's</a> typically used for one-time capital projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=275.105s">After</a> that capital project is paid off, then it goes down. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=278.806s">So</a> that's what that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=281.427s">The</a> school budget, as we've seen this past year, there's really not enough money to go around. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=291.386s">Some</a> people were saying why can't we just pay for it out of something like free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=298.173s">This</a> year we are taking money out of ARPA in order to meet some of the costs for that, but of course that can't sustain us over a long period of time because then we just run out of free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=314.11s">So</a> we really need to have a permanent way to sustain continuing costs of our school system, given the fact that the way Prop 2.5 is set up and the fact that Medford hasn't had any of these substantial development projects over the past 20 years, it's really necessary to do that at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=336.425s">If</a> we don't pass the 2.5 override, we will be basically at the same point next year, <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=343.885s">as</a> we are right now and we'll have to just have massive layoffs in the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=349.012s">It</a> won't be good. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=351.315s">I've</a> heard people talk about different points of opposition to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=356.061s">People</a> are trying to ask are there any alternatives to doing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=360.683s">Some</a> folks have said, have brought up, you know, okay, well, why can't Medford do more to develop businesses? <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=366.648s">City</a> Council is working on that very actively right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=369.71s">We</a> are essentially laying the foundation so that Medford will be much more business friendly in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=377.936s">The</a> most important thing that we're doing right now is the zoning overhaul, which we've had many very boring meetings about. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=386.13s">And</a> this will make it a lot easier and a lot clearer for businesses to know where they can open and the process for doing that in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=393.357s">It's</a> just that that can't get us money over a 2-3 year period that we would need to fund our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=401.424s">That</a> can get us money over the next 5-10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=405.59s">and</a> that's just where we're at. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=407.251s">If</a> we had had this override 20 years ago, we'd be in a much better position today, but my job is to focus on where we're at right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=415.838s">The</a> other thing that I frequently hear in response to this is, well, why can't Medford do more with less? <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=424.244s">Why</a> can't we cut more costs than we have before? <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=428.527s">And</a> the answer to that, of course, is that we are already very much at the bone in terms of <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=436.007s">money,</a> so in this blog post that I'm pairing this video with, I lay out some comparative statistics. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=442.829s">There's</a> a lot of ways that you can throw around different comparisons of Medford's property tax rates, our operating budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=451.992s">Our</a> total budget, our total spending for this year, according to the budget that we approved at this past meeting, is $218,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=461.562s">million</a> dollars which is attached in a memo that we approved and in this blog post I also just give a very top-level overview of the line items of that budget as well which is literally just copy and pasted from the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=479.959s">There's</a> a lot of things there like Medford Public Schools is of course the biggest line item there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=485.804s">The</a> second biggest is insurance which <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=489.16s">The</a> city has to pay off, you know and different there's a lot of complications behind all these things So for instance health insurance rates spiked pretty substantially due to lingering after-effects of kovat which Took up more of the city's budget than usual, which is one of the many reasons that we're facing this shortfall with the schools today But you know, this is I frequently hear people say well I pay my taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=512.846s">Where</a> does my money go? <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=513.547s">and</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=515.831s">This</a> budget right here that we approved is where, you know, where your money went. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=522.177s">There's</a> also many meetings, which we've uploaded to YouTube, which shows all of the individual meetings we've had with the individual departments over these different budget line items, in which each department head specifies why they need what they need in very great detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=541.275s">We're</a> really at the point where if we try to cut any more than we already have it will be detrimental financially in the future and this man if like At some like if there's a huge Administrative bloat then that's one thing and you could you know make things more efficient that way but eventually the system becomes brittle if you just keep doing that and it breaks apart very easily there is a instance where <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=569.71s">that</a> made the news last week where City of Arlington lost $445,000 to a phishing scam because they refused to put any sort of investment into their IT department. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=583.945s">So</a> pennies smart, dollars stupid, it's important to avoid that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=589.911s">My</a> colleague <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=591.038s">Councilor</a> Callaghan, the Chair of the Public Works Committee, she gave a very nice spiel at the last City Council meeting that detailed how if we keep letting our roads in Medford get worse than they are today, <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=607.238s">then</a> it will be exponentially more costly to repair them than if we did this debt exclusion for $500,000 right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=615.441s">So</a> people say, you know, our taxes, our property taxes are very high, and of course, you know, they are, but they are lower than the vast majority of municipalities in Massachusetts, even accounting for the very high property <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=634.856s">assessed</a> prices in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=637.597s">I</a> mean, our $8.65 per $1,000 of assessed value is lower than 7 out of every 8 cities in the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=652.868s">when</a> you're accounting for cities with a population above 20,000, then Medford is in, which there's like 96 cities, 96 municipalities in the Commonwealth with a population above that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=666.757s">Then</a> in terms of per capita operating budget, I think Medford is in, usually it's like the bottom five cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=672.841s">So</a> the point of this being that when there's people that are saying, oh, we need to save money, we need to, you know, et cetera, et cetera, <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=679.733s">Um,</a> there's really not a whole lot more we can save in the few, uh, suggestions I have heard around that, you know, some, I, somebody was saying like, oh, we should fire the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=690.178s">Like</a> that, that's literally illegal. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=691.579s">Like</a> you can't do things like that under state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=694.56s">Um,</a> no, we're, we're about like, there's no $2.7 million that's being spent elsewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=700.903s">There's</a> no $6 million line item that we can just cut without having massive consequences. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=705.325s">So</a> this is all a way of saying that, uh, this override is, <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=710.639s">very</a> necessary at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=713.541s">It's</a> essentially the only choice we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=716.944s">The</a> work that City Council is doing right now in the zoning overall is going to have more substantial effects in Medford's long-term development. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=726.832s">That</a> will really allow <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=728.973s">more</a> businesses to come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=730.494s">It'll</a> make the process a lot clearer and easier for outside parties to set up shop here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=735.878s">It's</a> just we're not, it's just this is where we are now and we're trying to get the firefighters a station that they've been promised for <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=745.081s">over</a> a decade now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=746.382s">We're</a> trying to get the DDPW internal staff so that they can actually repair the massive backlog of roads that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=754.584s">And</a> we're trying to make it so that the teachers in the Medford public school system will not have to be laid off next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=764.168s">And</a> there's actually, we can actually promise them that they'll be able to keep their jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=770.35s">And</a> we are trying to <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=773.511s">invest</a> in arts and vocational programs so that the kids who are right now being educated in the Medford public school system will have a good and enriching education because they don't have another 10 to 12 years to wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=791.736s">So</a> this is all just a kind of a high-level initial overview of what this is all about, why this is, you know, our only option <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=801.328s">At</a> the moment and why I would strongly encourage everybody to talk to your neighbors about why they need to vote on this <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=811.404s">on</a> all three of these ballot measures, why that's just really what the city needs right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=816.046s">And</a> I'd like to thank you so much for listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=820.167s">If</a> there's any other questions that you do have about the overrides, I would encourage you to email me on the contact form on my website. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=828.47s">I</a> generally only like to talk about the things where I have a clear, definite answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=834.672s">I</a> will try to be <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=836.492s">So</a> I can't promise you the timeliness of all of those responses. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=841.034s">But</a> I will be trying to update this page, this blog post on my website with common questions as I hear them. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=848.196s">So</a> thank you very much for listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/7bxzQL-mir8&t=851.338s">And</a> have a wonderful summer. <a

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2357.378s">Thank</a> you, Paola. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2358.919s">I</a> do appreciate the energy that has clearly been put into breaking down a very <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2366.795s">complicated</a> set of topics down and simplifying it for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2374.357s">I</a> would personally be of the mind that I do want to engage in the rating exercise, but I fully agree that it can be done offline. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2385.059s">And</a> perhaps there could be a motion to do that before the next meeting, before this has ended. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2391.02s">What</a> I would like to ask you is in terms of these <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2396.141s">general</a> topics that you've seen from the comprehensive plan and the cap plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2400.244s">And</a> I do understand that there are certain things that are very broad and there's certain things, like you said, the heating that were very specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2409.11s">What</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2410.515s">very,</a> and it's going to be very difficult for y'all to come up with something that can integrate all of the themes from both of these into one comprehensive zoning plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2423.619s">What,</a> from your impressions, <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2428.789s">could</a> there really be, do you really see there being like contradictions when you're actually trying to implement these things? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2437.457s">So</a> if, you know, there is, could be, you know, there could be a need for better transportation, there could be a need for more affordable housing, there could be a need to <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2453.112s">make</a> buildings more energy efficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2456.074s">Do</a> you see any of these things in a single zoning plan strongly contradicting each other when you really get down to the nitty gritty? <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2468.323s">I'd</a> like to hear your general thoughts on that.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=2534.068s">Okay,</a> so when we're rating things, it's not like we're saying you should do this instead of this.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3588.188s">Well,</a> so I asked to be recognized before the chair made the proposal, but I was actually going to make a motion to just have this emailed to Councilors after the meeting so that we could submit our feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3606.296s">And</a> then outside the meeting, maybe <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3610.646s">have</a> Paola forward the sticky note page to us and then move on because I don't, given the fact that we all do tend to talk quite a bit, I do it too, I'm doing it right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=3624.095s">I</a> think it would take more time than what we have left.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=4435.301s">Affordable</a> housing and transportation.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5316.525s">Well,</a> maybe I just won't second then. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5319.025s">Maybe</a> I just won't second. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5320.266s">Oh,</a> no, second. <a href="https://youtu.be/-smS3pjc1I0&t=5322.887s">I</a> second.

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6781.919s">Thank</a> you, council president. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6784.561s">It</a> is so much easier to criticize action than it is inaction. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6791.546s">And</a> unfortunately for decades, this city <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6799.005s">has</a> really not done a whole lot to address the structural underfunding that has led up to this fiscal cliff. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6810.549s">I</a> want to be extremely clear that if this override doesn't pass, as the mayor said, we will be here next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6818.953s">We</a> will have to lay a lot of people off. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6823.138s">The</a> roads will continue to be in the state they're in. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6826.101s">And</a> as my colleague said, they will continue to get worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6830.647s">The</a> fire department will not get its headquarters. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6833.851s">We</a> need this. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6837.222s">as</a> Council Vice President Collins said, this is the most important vote that is coming before this Council tonight, that has come before this Council so far this term. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6848.677s">Now,</a> I don't know what it means to <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6853.464s">do</a> an override right. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6854.605s">I'm</a> sure that they've had, that they've done it differently in other cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6858.048s">And</a> I know that my colleagues on council, my colleagues on school committee and the mayor may have slightly different views on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6865.535s">They</a> announced the financial task force months ago via press release. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6869.358s">It</a> was never a secret committee and they had to work out a compromise to bring what we're seeing today. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6877.671s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6878.631s">And</a> I'm not going to sit here and criticize people who are trying to address the issues that people have been talking about in this city for decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6891.294s">And</a> I'm sure that a lot of people will come around and say, you know, we need more development. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6897.776s">We</a> need to work, do more with less, whatever that means. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6905.158s">We</a> need to <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6906.997s">I</a> mean, we're already down to the bone, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6910.698s">I've</a> been to the school committee budget meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6914.32s">They've</a> already stripped the school budget down as far as it can possibly go. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6919.401s">If</a> this doesn't pass, we don't know what we'll do next year, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6923.663s">So</a> I just wanna make the point that this is, I think, any kind of action, any kind of action <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6933.348s">any</a> kind of choice that the voters have, that we can give the voters is praiseworthy. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6939.192s">I</a> commend my colleagues for doing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6942.634s">This</a> is going to be historic in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6945.516s">This</a> is what we need right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6949.739s">And</a> big picture, I just want to really drive that point home. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6954.902s">You</a> know, unity is not doing what <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6961.021s">the</a> loudest people in the room say we should do. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6964.366s">Unity</a> is fixing the problems that the vast majority of the city have told us about, even if our solutions aren't perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6976.226s">So</a> thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6977.207s">I</a> heard a, I heard a groan in the audience when council, when the council president listed the large amount of speakers that, uh, that still had to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6987.474s">And</a> so I think everybody wants to get to public comment period. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6990.396s">So</a> I'm going to leave it at that and thank all those who've spoken so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=6994.759s">And</a> I look forward to hearing what folks have to say.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7742.773s">No,</a> this is just a quick one. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7743.935s">So</a> Councilor Scarpelli brought up twice or several times the fact that his <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7749.929s">previous</a> paper was a rule 21. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7753.05s">I</a> just want to be clear about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7755.291s">So</a> first off, if anybody would like to look at the May 28th meeting, the city council meetings are now on YouTube. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7762.173s">So</a> you're free to look up how that particular debate went. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7766.054s">But</a> I rule 21'ed it because it was a <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7770.916s">vague</a> resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7772.037s">It</a> was just to generally discuss options for the school budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7778.142s">Councilor</a> Scarpelli had previously submitted a similar resolution several meetings before, and he was asked by the council president to make his resolutions more specific so that people would know what he specifically intended to bring to the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7792.934s">The</a> last one was a resolution to discuss subcommittee processes, and it ended up in <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7800.425s">Um,</a> it ended up veering into a letter that my colleagues had signed. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7805.248s">Um,</a> so it just generally got off topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7808.65s">So</a> I just wanted to clarify that I wanted the resolutions of themselves to be specific so that we will know what is being talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7818.536s">We</a> could have talked about that resolution today, but my colleague decided to withdraw it, um, at the beginning of the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7826.06s">So</a> we never did. <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7827.761s">That's</a> all.

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=1606.41s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3376.145s">I'd</a> also like to add that in addition to my colleagues' efforts on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3381.188s">So</a> I talked to legal about what options city council has in helping the tenants. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3388.933s">And</a> honestly, as we've been hinting, there isn't really a whole lot that we can do given the current tools that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3396.497s">There's</a> a lot that we could have done if different choices were made 30 years ago, if the city had decided to plant that tree 30 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3405.502s">We</a> could have put up the money to do that, but we can't right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3410.205s">But</a> right now, this city council is asking, trying to ask the state to give us the tools to prevent that. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3417.89s">And</a> not only are we seeing these real estate management companies not respond to their own tenants, not sit down to negotiate, but we're also seeing them actively fight tooth and nail to prevent cities from having those tools in the first place because they're making so much money from this. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3436.563s">What</a> they're spending their time doing, and I'm sure that a lot of people in this room have received those mailers, is put out information, mass text robocalls that are scaring average homeowners, average residents into thinking that these initiatives that this city council is pursuing is going to hurt them. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3455.381s">It's</a> not. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3456.162s">It</a> is going to prevent your neighbors from being driven out of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3460.171s">Okay?</a> That's what we're seeing, is a very small number of bad actors put out propaganda to prevent the city from having even the minimum amount of tools necessary to prevent this from happening in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3472.82s">So</a> I know that, you know, people come here and they don't like to see it when their neighbors get kicked out because right now these problems have a face to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3484.487s">They</a> have the face of your neighbor saying that we're going to have to leave because a big company is telling us to leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3491.043s">And</a> then it feels bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3491.945s">But</a> when people say, Oh, you know, somebody should have done something about this 30 years ago, somebody should have done something about this before. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3499.777s">That's</a> because everytime anybody's tried to do anything about it, <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3504.517s">big</a> money interest will come in and prevent it from happening through these sorts of opposition campaigns, which we're seeing in Medford right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3513.282s">So</a> I'd like to point that out, that that's an important piece of context. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3518.065s">The</a> Charles Gate Realty Group is not giving silence. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3521.327s">What</a> they're doing is giving large donations to state senators, state representatives, telling them to nix these initiatives at the state level. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3530.513s">That's</a> what's happening right now.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=3979.517s">I'd</a> also like to just, the CPA seems to come up a lot here, but something like $2.4 million is already going to affordable housing initiatives to rebuild Walkling Court.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4004.674s">Please</a> do not interrupt. Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Scarpelli, <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4007.696s">I</a> sat on the CPA prior to being elected to this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4012.998s">Now,</a> affordable housing projects that involve building do come along less frequently than open space and historic preservation projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4021.002s">And</a> so typically a larger portion of funding needs to be dedicated to those. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4025.744s">One</a> project, because the CPA has not really been around all that long. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4030.546s">Now,</a> funding, <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4032.607s">a</a> mediator, I suppose, is not a solution to these problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4040.574s">They're</a> trying... Councilor Scarpelli, they're trying to find mediation. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4043.377s">They've</a> said that they're trying to find mediation. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4045.358s">So</a> putting more money towards somebody else that's also trying to find mediation is not a long-term sustainable solution to this <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4055.387s">to</a> this problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4056.588s">Now,</a> I agree with what Vice President Collins just said. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4060.03s">This</a> has gotten off topic, but I hear so much misinformation about the CPA being thrown around these chambers that I did feel like addressing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLB8kUQDNJc&t=4067.596s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=189.814s">Well,</a> I'm not saying that she's muted. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=192.395s">It</a> could be an audio input situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=195.895s">If</a> you could check your speaker in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=208.134s">Francis?</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=395.503s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=401.627s">Any</a> questions from my fellow Councilors?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=505.611s">I</a> can speak to that a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=507.171s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=507.491s">Yeah</a> For the interruption. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=509.532s">So</a> I've had some communications of legal about this nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=513.834s">Um,</a> nothing normal, but they um, uh, it was attorney austin. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=518.416s">I</a> have any email from her where she says she can <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=521.657s">in</a> order to review the legal authority, in order to establish legal authority for this, you would have to, she could review the public purpose, municipal finance limitations under state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=531.761s">So</a> I think that what would need to come from this committee tonight is a motion to request that legal, essentially review these documents in order, and just get us a memo to say that, you know, this is okay under the public, under public purpose limitations. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=552.11s">I</a> looked at other parts of the municipal code, and I just I think that putting this squarely in the veteran services office just every all things considered is the most appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=564.96s">The</a> other 4 do seem to be just taken straight out of state law, but again. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=571.983s">Like</a> there's there's literally four authorities that are directly granted in there, but I really don't see think that there'll be much of an issue with just putting this and there is an additional one on the city side. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=584.398s">I</a> did have some discussions with. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=589.224s">the</a> city's chief of staff in this area and just over, you know, I think that her concerns were, you know, just operationalizing it, having it, you know, having these funds recur year to year. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=604.352s">But</a> I also think that those parts of it could probably be figured out sort of at the implementation level, whereas this is just mainly <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=616.923s">explicitly</a> saying that the Director of Veterans Services has the authority to implement this sort of a program. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=622.684s">So</a> I don't think that every single bit of this would necessarily need to be defined in the ordinance other than this very small paragraph. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=632.907s">So</a> I hope that lends some clarity there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=635.907s">Councilor</a> Callahan, did I see your hand raised? <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=640.229s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=641.949s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=657.762s">Okay,</a> on the motion of Councilor Lazzaro to send this to legal counsel to, I guess the specific wording should be to determine the, what would be a good word is, to send this to legal for review, probably the best way to phrase it, and keep the paper in committee, seconded by Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=688.919s">Do</a> we have any further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=695.405s">Okay,</a> clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=747.731s">Is</a> it says network bandwidth is low.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=767.159s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=769.2s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=770.201s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=772.782s">You</a> record Shaw. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=776.57s">very</a> much for attending. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=779.852s">Now</a> we are going to move on to 24354 resolution to publish the City Council newsletter. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=791.74s">The</a> draft of the current newsletter, which was so kindly prepared by <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=800.936s">Councilor</a> Lazzaro, that should be in everybody's agenda packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=805.619s">I</a> am just going to pull up the draft of it just so that we can prepare for any edits that may be necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=816.266s">Hold</a> on. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=819.184s">Okay,</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=821.365s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=821.805s">There</a> was 1 suggestion that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=826.007s">Was</a> taken that I took in just in the. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=830.188s">Few</a> days in between, so I think that there's still a little bit of. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=835.676s">still</a> a little bit of few details that need to be worked out in terms of who's distributing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=842.382s">I</a> know that the city clerk received an influx of emails after his email was put directly on the last newsletter. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=851.068s">And</a> I think that discussions about distribution by the city would still need to be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=859.715s">But</a> in the meantime, I put, <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=862.418s">hear</a> a Bitly link, Bitly Medford City Council newsletter, which links to a Google form that both have access to. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=875.009s">Essentially,</a> this is just a very simple thing that <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=879.113s">people</a> would be able to come up with people potentially would be able to just look at on their on their websites. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=886.862s">It's</a> just a suggestion by myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=889.726s">But</a> otherwise, if anybody else has any discussion on that or any suggestions, I'd be pleased to hear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=894.952s">Councilor</a> Calderon.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1013.889s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1017.093s">So,</a> uh, Councilor Nazaro.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1105.312s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1105.572s">So</a> I would, being a scientist and in favor of impartial, neutral language, I would also, now that I'm kind of saying it, and I should, full disclosure, just say that I have already reviewed this, but looking at it, it's kind of with eyes, like a big set of eyes. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1129.008s">I</a> would also favor just kind of getting, removing this part.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1233.028s">Sorry,</a> my internet connection is unstable, so I thought that you were finished when it was just a lag. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1240.06s">Councilor</a> Tseng, do you have anything further?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1376.162s">Councilor</a> Callahan.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1467.849s">I</a> think that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1471.391s">The</a> other thing here is, and this is a bit of Cher's editorial review, but when I'm formatting this, I'll include links to all of these, which is only accessible in the digital version, but still. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1485.976s">Okay,</a> I did want to address. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1488.859s">So,</a> if Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1490.02s">Was</a> Zara's point about. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1495.545s">This</a> being the individual so. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1500.269s">I</a> do feel like when we're starting out with this newsletter, it is best to err on the side of caution and humor could perhaps come in at a later time when it's sort of a more established thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1514.537s">And</a> I do think that having a positive spin on things is not a bad thing, especially when we're giving $250,000 to all these organizations in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1529.685s">having</a> like phrasing that in a positive in a positive light is not a bad thing but when starting out it I think it is it is best to just kind of like present things as they're as they happen and then when we sort of see what this becomes we'll kind of like be more familiar like what we're able to and not able to do with it <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1559.537s">I</a> don't know if that was a great perspective on that, but I don't, we don't necessarily have to like avoid any sort of humor whatsoever, but I do understand the reaction that we're starting at. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1579.244s">Okay,</a> Councilor Tseng.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1645.567s">So,</a> okay, so actually I do remember that we did talk about that and the recent subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1651.37s">Clerk,</a> would you be able to comment on is that acceptable under open meeting law because listening sessions is not technically on this agenda.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1664.181s">I</a> know that was discussed, but this could be an oversight on my end.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1821.712s">So</a> I'd like to. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1822.973s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1823.193s">So</a> I think we hopefully we can get this done. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1827.516s">deadline.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1831.62s">No,</a> no, no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1832.36s">That's</a> that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1833.782s">So</a> do we have a motion on the floor to approve?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1854.378s">Yeah,</a> sure, we could do that motion as well.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1880.827s">I</a> would second that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1883.909s">And</a> can we add to that motion to approve the newsletter?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1891.713s">And</a> to keep the paper.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1895.253s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1895.973s">And</a> keep the paper in committee.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1899.235s">Clerk,</a> will you spell the roll? <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1904.198s">And</a> I'll be ready.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1928.638s">Chair</a> Leming? <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1931.94s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1932.62s">Motion</a> is passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1933.681s">Do</a> we have any other motions on the floor?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1937.203s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1939.184s">Clerk,</a> please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1940.384s">Are</a> you ready?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZHb2ZhCwFo&t=1957.061s">Yes,</a> meeting is adjourned.<h2><a href="../2024-06-01_ZkSmsyn-XNs/2024-06-01_ZkSmsyn-XNs.html">City Council Committee of the Whole 05-21-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=11.776s">Present.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5574.991s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5576.932s">Just</a> like everybody watching this, to understand just a couple of basic things about the city's financial situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5584.597s">So</a> first off, this is a very long time coming, and it would be easy to sit here and talk about this or that decision, complain about everything <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5597.325s">under</a> the sun about why we're here right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5601.109s">But</a> at the end of the day, the problem is systemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5603.912s">So</a> Proposition 2.5 prevents the city from increasing its total tax levy, the total amount of money we take in from property taxes, by 2.5% every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5615.304s">The</a> average inflation from 1980 till today <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5619.789s">1980</a> was when Prop 2.5 was passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5621.651s">That</a> average rate has been 3.08%. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5622.973s">So</a> that means that the value of the budget in 1980 adding up would be about three quarters as <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5634.385s">The</a> modern budget would be about three quarters as valuable as it was back then. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5638.047s">This</a> is somewhat offset by growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5640.908s">Cities</a> that have had a lot of development in the past 44 years, Cambridge over with Kendall Square, Somerville with Assembly Row have not had to pass an override. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5654.193s">But</a> Medford hasn't seen that development just in the longer term. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5659.335s">There</a> are a variety of reasons for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5661.776s">Um,</a> so I think that this is not a panel of judges criticizing others decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5669.642s">It</a> is our job to come up with solutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5671.804s">I'm</a> not going to sit here and either be administrators or the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5677.928s">five</a> loaves of bread and two fishes and tell you that you need to feed 5,000 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5682.591s">That's</a> just not how this works. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5685.072s">I</a> think that we need to get real about the budgetary situation and say that we do need an override of some sort just because the system that we're in inherently leaves us with a broken budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5701.042s">The</a> problem is that <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5703.303s">passing</a> it to if we were to pass it to if we were to pass an override that money would not be available from now till the next fiscal year so there's the matter of bridging that gap it is not in the city council's authority to set to raise any of these line items it is <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5726.414s">not</a> in the authority of the City Council to say, hey, we need to take, you know, $6 million or $2.7 million from free cash and use that to fund the school systems in the interim. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5739.24s">That</a> is up to the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5741.361s">The</a> City Council is working on a lot of other things, a lot of other initiatives which will address this fiscal shortfall in the long term. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5749.525s">Not</a> all of our solutions are perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5751.546s">We</a> just got done with a committee meeting where <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5754.827s">I</a> was proposing a commercial vacancy tax to help to address the vacant storefront problems in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5760.689s">It's</a> not a perfect solution, no solution is, but I'm trying to bring solutions forward to help address our problems instead of just complaining about the decisions that are made by other people and acting like I have no power in this situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5774.093s">So</a> that is, so that being said, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5779.81s">That</a> is what I personally think should be done about this situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5783.452s">I</a> understand that there are arguments against taking free cash out of reserves. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5791.397s">We're</a> looking to fund a new high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5793.017s">Having</a> an amount of free cash is important in order to get a good interest rate for the loan for that new high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5798.961s">So</a> in that way, spending that money now could end up just affecting the city's bottom line 10 years from now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5805.064s">the</a> mayor's proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5805.664s">But</a> I do think that in this situation it is more necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5809.866s">It</a> is necessary to make that that decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5812.747s">I</a> look forward to seeing, um, what the mayor's proposal is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5816.849s">Um</a> if she doesn't if she doesn't want to do that, or if she finds cuts in other areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5823.872s">Obviously,</a> I wish that other decisions have been made beforehand. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5830.535s">I</a> think that an override should have been passed a lot earlier so that we wouldn't be dealing with this right at the edge of that fiscal cliff, but it is what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkSmsyn-XNs&t=5843.407s">People</a> aren't looking for people sitting behind, sitting in these chairs to come up with complaints about a budget situation that obviously nobody

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=11.998s">Present.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=73.319s">Yes,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=75.581s">So</a> this here is a draft of a home rule petition which would allow us the authority to, which would allow the city of Medford the authority to actually impose the commercial vacancy tax on landlords that own vacant commercial storefront properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=98.777s">businesses</a> or businesses that are effectively closed all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=105.58s">When</a> I was going door-to-door campaigning, I ran into people who talked about the fact that in West Medford and South Medford, there are a lot of businesses that don't, that are just a lot of buildings that are owned by landlords who just never <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=123.507s">rent</a> them out to businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=126.469s">There</a> was one woman who was trying to get in contact with the owner of the dry cleaner that was closed at the time in West Medford for about a year and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=137.834s">She</a> said that this person wouldn't even pick up the phone to talk to her. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=143.257s">She</a> wanted to open up a gym there, but that's obviously difficult to do if you can't even talk to the person who owns the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=150.76s">So</a> there's, I did research on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=155.341s">There's</a> not a whole lot of default authorities that cities have to leverage this sort of attacks. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=163.263s">So</a> what I've been doing is two different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=167.864s">The</a> first is the home rule petition draft that is in this agenda packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=172.164s">And</a> this would just give us the very basic legal authority to be able to enact attacks such that it would <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=179.946s">B,</a> it would effectively disincentivize property owners from doing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=185.128s">And</a> there are a few specifics in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=187.749s">First</a> off, it says that the proceeds from the tax will be put into a special fund that will help to aid in the repair upkeep of these properties, as well as funding local mechanisms to incurrent tenant occupancies, such as advertising for these properties and so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=208.997s">Sometimes,</a> and this gets into the fact that sometimes these properties are vacant for reasons that are outside of the property owner's control. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=222.082s">Maybe</a> the building is not in good enough shape to attract a tenant at all, so they would need extra funds to repair the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=234.327s">and</a> such. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=235.248s">There's</a> also another clause in here that specifically would enable landlords who own the property to terminate the tenancy of any business that currently has a lease with them but it's just not doing anything with that and this was because a specific <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=256.062s">scenario</a> is brought to my attention where the tax would be the tax in this place would be placed on the owner of the property but sometimes they may have a lease in which the person who they may have a lease with a business owner who <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=273.118s">it's</a> really in their authority to make sure that they're actually running a business day-to-day in that case. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=281.364s">What</a> I've also been doing, so this here is just meant to ask the state to give Medford permission to be able to enact this vacancy tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=293.632s">This</a> obviously isn't the entire ordinance, so we just give the basic legal authority to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=299.916s">If</a> and when the state <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=302.017s">does</a> give permission to Medford to enact such a tax, there would obviously be other rules that are put in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=309.443s">For</a> instance, a tax wouldn't be applied immediately after vacancy starts, there would be a grace period, there would just be other <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=321.531s">that</a> are put in place to make sure that these scenarios I've heard about where, you know, you're not just unfairly penalizing people who may be in a situation where tenants are just not, where tenants are just not trying to rent out good businesses and their properties and so on. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=339.978s">But</a> this, again, this is just about giving the city the basic legal authority to do that simultaneously. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=345.16s">And</a> this is, <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=347.361s">Um.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=347.481s">Relate</a> this is related to this initiative, but I figured it would be it would best go into zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=354.924s">Um</a> I've also put in work around a vacant building ordinance, which is something that the city currently does have the authority to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=363.627s">Um</a> there's it's similar. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=366.388s">They</a> have had similar initiatives over in East Hampton and some other <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=377.088s">The</a> city doesn't have the authority to levy a tax for profit, but we do have the authority to levy a fee in order to make something cost neutral. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=391.717s">So</a> the vacant building ordinance that East Hampton implemented basically <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=397.96s">would</a> charge the owners of vacant buildings, something like $1,000 a year to as long as long as the buildings are buildings are vacant to maintain a public vacant building database which would be maintained by staff members and so. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=414.545s">You'd</a> only be allowed to charge enough for that to pay for the staff cost of maintaining that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=421.415s">So,</a> again, that is one initiative that we're looking into, and that would likely create the foundation to enact commercial vacancy tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=431.488s">in</a> Medford, if and when this particular petition is approved, if this council does end up passing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=439.613s">But</a> overall, this is my effort to address a problem that I heard about from residents time and time again, which is they don't like to see so many closed down storefronts in <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=452.499s">Medford.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=453.76s">They</a> think that the issue is sometimes, not in all cases, but sometimes landlords that just for whatever reason either don't want to or don't have the funds to be able to rent out their storefronts that they own to <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=473.095s">businesses</a> and so this is an effort to help give them to help build up the funds to either help advertise for tenants or repair their properties as it may be. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=485.64s">So</a> the only change I would <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=490.196s">I</a> personally suggest the text the clerk pointed out that typically homeworld petitions don't have the word resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=495.88s">They</a> have the word enacted there so I would motion to change that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=502.424s">After</a> we hear comment from both the economic development director who I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=510.469s">see</a> us on Zoom, as well as any members of the public who are interested in seeing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=514.693s">I</a> would personally like to refer it to the regular council meeting, but I also look forward to hearing what my colleagues have to say about it as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=527.364s">So,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=905.694s">So</a> I do respect the sentiment that things like this can have unintended consequences. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=913.46s">Again,</a> like I said, the Home Rule petition itself would only give the city the very basic legal authority to be able to rent, to be able to enact this tax to begin with. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=926.972s">It</a> says nothing about timelines post vacancy to <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=932.456s">uh</a> after which the tax would apply um so the idea behind this would be if the state does grant us the authority to do this it would be just one uh it it would <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=947.637s">Hopefully</a> the ordinance would be able to be crafted so that it makes it so that these negative consequences would be very practically disincentivized in the actual implementation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=960.908s">Some</a> other concerns that I did have though is that I went to a meeting very recently where a developer just outright told me that keeping some of the properties that he owned <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=972.797s">vacant</a> was actually profitable for him because it would make a tax, it would make, he could just write off, write it off as a loss in his taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=980.382s">So</a> sometimes it is beneficial to landlords, it is in their best interest to keep these properties vacant and that is <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=991.849s">really</a> that is really one factor that this is meant to disincentivize. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=998.634s">I</a> do look forward to seeing how that grant application goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1002.497s">Obviously</a> there is no one tool that the city has that will be able to fix the problem that we've been experiencing for a long time, which is vacant storefronts, but <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1014.625s">a</a> combination of carrots and sticks are needed to be able to address this problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1019.928s">And</a> like I also said, the idea behind this is that the funds would go, is that the revenue from this tax would go into a fund specifically meant to help out those vacant storefronts when they do, if they are in a state in which they can't be rented out. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1042.421s">Again,</a> like, like, 11 thing that some members of the Chamber of Commerce told me about that dry cleaner over in West Medford is that there's very significant repairs that need to be made to it to be before it can be rented out on the tune of. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1059.46s">I</a> think 70, don't hold me to it, but I think it said something like $70,000 worth of repairs at the time needed to be made. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1065.603s">And</a> I don't know where that money would come from. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1068.285s">So</a> the idea behind this is to be able to collect some fund, which is specifically meant to address those issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1077.309s">But</a> I do respect the views and the efforts of our economic development director, but it is my belief that <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1087.645s">multiple</a> tools and initiatives are needed to help to address this problem.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1134.797s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1135.398s">So,</a> often homeworld petitions are written in very simple, short, plain language. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1142.465s">Essentially,</a> this would just give the city permission in the 1st place to be able to then implement an ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1149.613s">So</a> my view, my view on this is. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1152.096s">we</a> will go to the state, ask them for permission to be able to just have the right to do this in the first place. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1158.66s">This</a> text obviously is not detailed enough to act as an ordinance or a set of rules in itself, but it would grant the legal authority to then be able to implement that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1172.989s">As</a> I said, there are initiatives in other cities right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1178.692s">They've</a> basically been doing the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1181.754s">In</a> East Hampton, they've implemented a vacant building ordinance, which effectively lets them tax owners of vacant buildings at certain very small rates just to maintain a database. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1194.38s">Again,</a> my concern with that is that that's not really enough to justify <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1202.104s">to</a> justify a tax write-off. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1206.126s">So</a> I think what would happen if we did that is that it would incentivize some owners of these properties to, if we just had a vacant building ordinance, it would incentivize some owners of these properties to rent out, but other owners, it would just, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1224.893s">it</a> would basically just be another number on a spreadsheet that they could account for. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=1229.336s">So</a> this essentially would allow us to levy a tax that would be enough to disincentivize them from doing that.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=2022.48s">So,</a> to address a couple of the points first off the city does not have a good handle on the number of vacant storefronts I talked to the building commissioner he had a part part of this just has to do with capacity and this was our conversations about the vacant bill about the vacant building ordinance that I also passed to zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=2042.486s">They</a> had a spreadsheet that had been last updated, I think, in 2015, but I don't think that they actually had the capacity to be able to figure it out and therefore get a handle on the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=2053.597s">Another</a> pattern in this <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=2058.722s">in</a> this conversation is, so I understand that there are unintended consequences, but there are things that I think would be more appropriate to solve using other means, like as Councilor Tseng was saying, I think it is more appropriate to worry about, to handle the idea of store of businesses that we don't want being in places we don't want with zoning rather than something like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=2084.122s">This</a> really is meant to address the, <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=2086.444s">the</a> small number of bad apples in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=2091.387s">The</a> tax incentive comment actually came from a developer that I was in a meeting with where the conversation was something like, I was talking about this initiative more at a high level way. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=2105.295s">I</a> said, listen, there's a lot of vacant properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=2110.858s">I'm</a> developing a commercial vacancy tax initiative around that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=2117.102s">And</a> the response from the developer was something like, Oh, well, I actually want to keep a few of my properties vacant because then I could just write that off as a loss on my taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=2128.79s">And</a> it's more beneficial for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=2130.732s">You</a> don't really understand how this works. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=2132.553s">And</a> it was sort of phrase like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=2134.494s">So</a> that was and saying that saying something like that to a public official where <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=2140.738s">It's</a> not in the public interest at all to have someone that owns these properties deliberately try to keep them empty. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=2148.922s">So</a> I think that we could definitely look into the specific tax rules that enable this to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=2160.768s">But</a> in regards to all the details of implementation and so on that we've been talking about, again, Home Rule petition step of this, if it is approved, would just allow the city to have the basic tools it needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=2180.091s">to</a> be able to craft an ordinance like this in the first place. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=2182.794s">So</a> when we're at the, as Councilor Lazzaro was saying, we do not need to have every single detail of this figured out at this stage. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=2191.304s">Hypothetically,</a> I'm not saying we should do this, we could <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=2195.729s">we</a> could we could even submit a home rule petition it gets approved we find out it's really not what the city needs maybe the uh grant that the economic development director uh submitting goes through and you know we find out that that really does address the problem and then down the line we find out we don't need it but at the same time we could also run into a situation where the grant doesn't go through or it just <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=2219.915s">doesn't</a> work and we actually do really need this tool in the toolbox if we're going to do something about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=2224.979s">And</a> in that case, it really would be useful to have a home rule petition submitted sooner rather than later so that several years from now we could potentially have something like this in our toolbox. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=2238.549s">So,</a> you know, I don't want with something like this, I do understand that there is, as Council Vice President Collins was hinting at, there is a <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=2248.997s">There</a> definitely is an optic situation where submitting something like this can send a message to business owners and property owners through the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ydN2g0zgEA&t=2259.386s">But</a> I also, at the same time, I don't want to get into analysis paralysis when this is really just the step 1 in the process.<h2><a href="../2024-05-19_x9FCCbALahQ/2024-05-19_x9FCCbALahQ.html">How property taxes work</a></h2>
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=1.027s">Hello</a> everybody, happy Sunday. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=2.347s">So</a> something that I'm going to talk about today is property taxes and Proposition 2.5. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=11.011s">Now</a> Proposition 2.5 is a subject that comes up a lot in city council work, particularly because it <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=20.914s">is</a> the law that dictates how much property taxes can increase year by year, and it's also something that city councils will frequently hear about from residents when it comes to both discussions about <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=35.008s">how</a> much people pay in taxes, as well as discussions about the overall city budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=41.129s">And</a> I think that a lot of people will tend to be confused on exactly how these numbers are calculated and how the amount that they're spending on property taxes year to year relate to the overall city budget and the fiscal situation we're in. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=56.773s">So</a> I'm just going to spend a little bit of time talking about this in this current video recap. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=65.255s">For</a> some background, Proposition 2.5 was a law that was passed in Massachusetts in 1980. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=72.04s">The</a> important part of the law is that it says that the total amount of money that municipalities can take in from property taxes cannot increase by more than 2.5% from one year to the next, barring new growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=92.196s">So</a> if a city <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=95.448s">builds</a> nothing in a given year, and they take in $100 million from property taxes in that same year, then they're not allowed to take in more than $102.5 million in property taxes the next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=107.794s">If</a> somehow they double their stock of housing from one year to the next, then they're allowed to take in $200 million in property taxes <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=125.388s">that</a> next year, but overall this means that cities are incentivized to grow their own tax base and they can't just keep increasing taxes arbitrarily. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=140.858s">The</a> trouble with Prop 2.5 is that typically inflation is more than 2.5%. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=148.226s">So</a> the average inflation from 1980 to today at a given year has been 3.07%. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=154.071s">So</a> that's about a 0.6% difference between what Prop 2 1⁄2 allows and what inflation actually is. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=163.418s">So</a> there was a Reddit post a few weeks ago where somebody was asking about this and I just did the very basic calculations that shows how that can sort of add up over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=176.458s">So,</a> hypothetically, if a city doesn't grow or doesn't build anything and it just keeps the same housing stock, the same businesses from one year to the next over a 44-year period from 1980 till today, and they applied the maximum increases allowed under Proposition 2.5, then because of the <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=203.263s">because</a> of the nature of inflation. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=205.885s">If</a> you end up just slowly increasing the amount of money you take in while inflation rises even higher, then you would only have about 78% of the budget in 2024 as you would have in 1980. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=219.255s">And</a> that's just in terms of value. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=221.837s">So</a> the amount of money that you're taking in from property taxes would, of course, increase, but because the value of that money decreases over time even though <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=232.386s">the</a> amount that you're taking from property taxes goes up, it's not keeping up inflation, so therefore the value would only be 70%. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=241.052s">And</a> that is in the hypothetical scenario where a city ends up applying the maximum property tax increase from one year to another. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=252.012s">The</a> trouble with that also is that if a city ends up refusing to increase property taxes over a given number of years, then that means that that city is permanently left behind, so you can't make up for that in a given year. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=266.836s">So</a> if a city, if for one given year, a mayor decides to not increase property taxes at all to get reelected, then they can't <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=279.719s">just</a> decide to bump property taxes up by 5% the next year to make up for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=286.044s">You</a> can still only increase by 2.5% in a given year. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=290.068s">So</a> that means, in terms of the value of the budget over time, is that if you have a 44-year period from 1980 till 2024, <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=304.995s">and</a> then you end up only increasing property taxes 34 of those 44 years, so there's like a 10 year period where they just decide to not increase property taxes at all, then the budget becomes even more eaten up by inflation over time, so in that case you'd only have 61% <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=327.573s">of</a> the budget in 2024 as you had in 1980. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=329.934s">And</a> again, all of these are hypotheticals. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=332.355s">So</a> they don't account for new growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=335.255s">They</a> don't account for cities adding new housing stock, adding new businesses, new buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=343.258s">And</a> so cities that have built up their commercial tax base over the preceding decades aren't really doing that badly. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=354.301s">So</a> Cambridge, they, <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=356.888s">they</a> ended up investing in Kendall Square, so that really increases their own commercial tax base. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=364.392s">Somerville</a> ended up investing in Assembly Row, which also substantially increased their tax base. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=369.795s">Medford</a> really hasn't done anything else like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=372.956s">Other</a> municipalities to account for this ended up having what's called a Prop 2.5 override. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=379.7s">And</a> that's where in one given year, <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=382.741s">a</a> municipality can increase their taxes by more than 2.5% if the voters decide to do so on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=393.89s">Now,</a> this is something that about 300 of the 351 municipalities in Massachusetts have done at some point, at least once since 1980. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=408.23s">So</a> not every city has done it, but the majority have, and they've usually done this to account for the underfunding that is a natural mathematical consequence of Proposition 2 1⁄2. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=422.597s">Medford</a> recently had a presentation by the school committee of a shortfall in their budget of about, <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=433.443s">$6</a> million, which is a result of this sort of long-term underfunding. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=439.407s">And</a> during that school committee meeting, the mayor said that we'll very likely need a Proposition 2.5 override at some point in the very near future to account for these fiscal shortfalls. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=450.233s">And</a> that'll be the first time, if it does happen, that Medford's ever had a Proposition 2.5 override. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=458.388s">So,</a> you know, it's necessary because inflation is never more than 2.5%. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=465.47s">Now,</a> a lot of people, when talking about this, they say, well, my property taxes go up every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=473.732s">Why</a> am I not seeing new city services as a result of that? <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=481.135s">What</a> gives? <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=483.118s">The</a> answer to that question is, first of all, your property taxes would increase every year to keep up with inflation. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=487.94s">It's</a> just that they don't increase enough to match the rate of inflation. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=494.183s">And</a> that's especially true in very high inflation years like we've seen. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=498.326s">like</a> we've seen during COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=499.567s">So</a> if inflation is like 9% in a given year and 3.4% in the next year, then those two years, as usual, inflation is still higher than 2.5%. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=512.517s">So</a> the budget is still permanently behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=514.618s">We</a> can't make up for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=516.26s">You</a> need an override. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=520.002s">The</a> other thing to understand about Proposition 2.5, and I <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=524.046s">feel</a> like this is something that when a lot of property owners see their tax bills go up and they also see, you know, they also think, okay, well, you know, my property taxes have definitely gone up more than 2.5% some years. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=542.652s">That's</a> true because what you got to understand about the 2.5% number <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=546.87s">is</a> that that applies to the amount overall that the city takes in as a whole, and you're only allowed to tax a certain percentage of the property's assessed value. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=559.618s">So</a> Medford's residential property tax rate is, I believe, <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=567.273s">$65</a> per $1,000 of assessed value. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=570.674s">And</a> that is a rate that has to be set across all properties, so you can't just charge certain people more, charge certain people less, it's a set amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=579.596s">And</a> that amount is set such that the overall amount that is taken in from property taxes in a given year will not be more than 2.5% in a previous year. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=589.858s">Now</a> what happens to individuals is that <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=593.743s">the</a> assessed value of their home could change from one year to another, depending on whether or not the assessor's office got to it that year. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=602.487s">So</a> I believe the assessor's office tries to reassess individual properties once every 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=609.131s">And</a> if a person has a property that was assessed at like $500,000 in the year 2000, and then suddenly given fluctuations of the housing market, the assessor's office gets back to in 2010, <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=623.665s">and</a> they found out that in 2010 it's now a million dollars they basically just they say okay well this property is now double what it was before and as a result a person's taxes are going to double in a given year if everything else remains constant and so that is very and so when a person <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=646.709s">When</a> a property owner sees, okay, my tax rates have just suddenly jumped very drastically from last year to this year, that's what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=658.503s">Nothing</a> about prop two and a half change, nothing about the overall percentage change, but the assessor's office is making its rounds on individual houses and updating the individual tax rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=669.355s">And</a> then as a result of that, an individual's property value might've increased. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=676.743s">The</a> assessor updated it and then boom. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=680.806s">So</a> this has a couple, so this has a few consequences. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=683.727s">What</a> this means is that certain people could end up paying more over time, but that's largely as a result of fluctuations in the market, like how much the assessor values houses in the city overall. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=699.35s">So</a> if the assessors, if everybody's house increases by a set rate, <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=708.665s">then</a> nobody's property taxes would increase by more than 2.5% in a given year. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=715.051s">But</a> if houses in a certain part of town ended up increasing at a much higher rate than everybody else's, what that would mean is that they would end up paying more property tax, but people in another part of town, and that would end up offsetting <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=733.924s">the</a> tax rates from people in another part of town that maybe their houses decreased in value or they just didn't go up as high of a rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=746.415s">Their</a> values just didn't go up as drastically. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=751.279s">So</a> that's what Prop 2.5 and property tax increases look like on both the <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=762.31s">citywide</a> level and to the individual. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=764.611s">And</a> I feel like people, when they hear about Prop 2.5, they might think like, okay, well, my property taxes shouldn't increase by 2.5% in any given year. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=773.476s">That's</a> not necessarily the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=776.277s">It</a> just applies to the amount of money that the city takes in overall. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=782.922s">So</a> what that means for an override is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=790.074s">Typically,</a> there's a bit of, you know, when you're <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=794.586s">when</a> you're asking, okay, how much are my property taxes gonna go up as a result of an override? <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=799.87s">It's</a> difficult to calculate the exact number. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=803.853s">What</a> I usually do is I say, how much money does Medford need to address its fiscal shortfall? <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=810.839s">And</a> then you would divide that number by 25,000, which is approximately the number of households in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=819.641s">And</a> that is approximately the amount that property taxes would go up in a given year. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=827.03s">And</a> again, these numbers are completely hypothetical, but if an override for a value of $5 million were proposed, and so you'd have maybe on the ballot it would say, <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=838.123s">Okay,</a> we need like three million dollars for the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=841.766s">We</a> need, you know, two other buckets of a million dollars for these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=845.408s">So</a> that's a total of five million dollars that the city needs extra next year to account for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=850.211s">Then</a> you would end up dividing that number by 25,000 and so that would be on average the amount that extra households would have to pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=861.934s">So,</a> which would work out to about, in that case, $5,000,000 divided by $25,000 would be $200 extra person. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=871.525s">Some</a> people would be paying less depending on if the value of their property were less than the average in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=877.392s">Some</a> people would be paying slightly more than that if their property value were higher. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=882.879s">that's</a> kind of what we're, those are like just some very approximate ballparkish numbers that we're looking at when it comes to just the increases in property taxes, how that ends up affecting the individual and how it sort of affects the overall state of the town. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=899.228s">The</a> consequence of this is that, I mean, a lot of people will end up saying, you know, I'm paying more in property taxes, but I'm not necessarily seeing, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=909.832s">any</a> increases in city service, and the truth is that those people are right. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=916.934s">They're</a> not, but the property taxes usually have to increase because the overall cost of living and the cost of just maintaining the services that the city has just gets more expensive over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=931.617s">One</a> thing that <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=933.322s">the</a> city's dealing with in the budget right now is the fact that largely as a result of offset cost of COVID, health insurance rates just spiked from 2023 to 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=944.731s">And</a> the city has no choice but to pay for those. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=948.014s">And</a> so that's a couple of extra million dollars out of the city's budget going to health insurance companies. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=953.638s">And</a> as a result, we need to, that's money that we can no longer use to pay teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=959.183s">That's</a> money that we can no longer use to pay city staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=963.795s">So</a> another thing that's happening right now, which we saw as a result, which we saw from a recent meeting that the DPW gave to city council when it was presenting to us, was the fact that roads in Medford, they're not in a very good state, but what our engineers were telling us was that <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=993.007s">maintaining</a> roads in the modern day is a lot more expensive than it was 20 years ago, largely as a result of global warming. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=1000.13s">So</a> it used to be that Massachusetts would have a winter and it would be super cold and everything would just freeze up one time, and then as the winter ended, it would get out of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=1011.574s">These</a> days what's happening is our winters are a lot more gets cold, gets hot, gets cold, gets hot, and that ends up tearing up the concrete. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=1019.297s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=1021.142s">that</a> means that it just takes a lot more money to maintain the roads, and because we're not putting more money towards that, the roads end up getting worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=1030.949s">And</a> this is also affected by a whole lot of other things in the economy, like the shortage of labor, just fewer people going into construction, fewer people that work construction can afford to live nearby, so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=1042.277s">So</a> a lot of what we're seeing is like a lot of the <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=1048.142s">The</a> fiscal shortfalls we're seeing today are the result of a lot of other factors that are going on in the global economy at the moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=1059.926s">We're</a> just seeing those costs offset to ourselves in other ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=1069.108s">So,</a> you know, this is just, you know, I'm just like releasing these videos just in hopes to make a little bit more sense of these rules and regulations and like what's happening fiscally to the population as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=1085.101s">And</a> I hope that it's, I hope it's helpful in helping folks understand what's happening at the city level. <a href="https://youtu.be/x9FCCbALahQ&t=1091.486s">In</a> any case, thank you very much for tuning in and happy Sunday.<h2><a href="../2024-06-01_zI7b343mLuM/2024-06-01_zI7b343mLuM.html">City Council

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=936.806s">Um,</a> I didn't bring the entire contract with me, but, uh, the, just to the question that I'm getting at is if we don't get the fire truck, uh, within the fist, the fiscal year that it's ordered, would that, could we just end up paying for that in a later fiscal year at a free cash or,
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=965.128s">I'm</a> just wondering when that money would actually go to the company.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=2195.254s">I</a> just had a question because Chief Buckley mentioned that the maintenance services are being cut and I'm seeing the line item here for motor services going from 75 to 65 and motor repair supplies going from 120 to 100, but it looks like the actuals for the motor services is about 5,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=2218.92s">Sorry,</a> it was about 5000 this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=2221.722s">And</a> the actuals for the motor repair supplies is about 36,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=2224.924s">So</a> is that is that it's kind of like typical utilization of that line item? <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=2232.029s">Year</a> to year? <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=2232.469s">Is</a> this just uniquely? <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=2233.55s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=2250.245s">My</a> apologies. <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=2251.465s">My</a> apologies. <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=2252.386s">It</a> was a slip.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=2259.307s">And</a> that was recorded too. <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=2263.088s">So,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=2266.809s">Oh,</a> man. <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=2268.489s">It's</a> going to be a long night. <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=2270.37s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=2283.123s">I</a> was focusing on the motor services expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=2287.688s">It</a> says that the actuals so far this year were about $5,000 out of a $75,000 allocation. <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=2292.253s">That</a> is as of December 31. <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=2298.32s">Well,</a> even so, the actuals are typically a little bit over 50%, but that just seems very low given the amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=2306.685s">So</a> I don't know if this is just a unique year where we haven't had a whole lot of repair problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=2314.771s">Would</a> you say that that's typical?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=2355.102s">I</a> guess the nature of the question is do you typically go under your allocated repair budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=2363.347s">Are</a> there some years where it's higher, some years where it's really low? <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=2366.909s">What</a> does that usually look like?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=2572.298s">Cool,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=2574.319s">Just</a> generally speaking, it would be useful, although I realize it could be a lot more effort for first-year Councilors to kind of see how <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=2582.745s">these</a> budgets have progressed over the years, just for context.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=2591.831s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=4784.394s">This</a> is just more of a general engineering staffing question, but I figured while I have you all here, I might as well ask it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=4796.945s">We're</a> doing the zoning overhaul, and I think I've talked to Owen about this, but just something I'd like to get a bit more understanding on. <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=4803.852s">Part</a> of it, which I've been having a lot of meetings on, is implementing <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=4807.615s">transportation,</a> demand management, zoning, ordinance, and I've been kind of shopping around different departments, begging people to fund and put somebody on a TDM study in the future, which would be required at the staff level. <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=4823.638s">Just</a> from my understanding, how much staff time does it usually take to coordinate that, even once you've found a firm that's able to get something like that off the ground?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=4845.118s">Sorry,</a> one of the on-calls?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=4856.243s">Does</a> that make sense? <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=4857.845s">Okay,</a> so you would reach out to an on-call consultant who would then find the firm to actually do this?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=4876.243s">Okay,</a> so it wouldn't actually take any staff time for the people that are being budgeted here? <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=4883.61s">You</a> just kind of ask for them to do that?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=4901.389s">And</a> about, I understand that your staff are a capacity, but about how much time does that usually take to check in?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=7696.097s">The</a> words are pretty similar to be fair.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=9054.5s">Just</a> like to say, we're very grateful to have you here. <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=9057.784s">Welcome</a> to the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=9060.807s">And</a> I'm sure that everybody here is an elected official can tell you our own stories about how chaotic the November elections were and how. <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=9071.238s">personally</a> stressful it was I would just encourage you if you see anything in the elections office that you think could be fixed in terms of making things more efficient or you know just anything you see then please feel free to bring it to council's attention or to fix it <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=9093.487s">fix</a> it yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=9094.427s">So</a> I went to the, you know, I chatted with some of the elections workers a couple of weeks ago and just kind of saw how they were doing manual data entry on what looked like very outdated software, just spending a lot of time entering the voter registration cards prior to the March elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=9120.865s">I'm</a> not an expert on things like that, but it did seem like there was some room for improvement, either in terms of whatever software they're using, um, or just. <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=9132.793s">I'm</a> not I'm not really sure if you would have any ideas on that, but if there is a way that council can help support that in the future and make the elections department more. <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=9142.4s">Scalable</a> or efficient or less prone to having these kind of mistakes that we've seen in previous years, we're all ears.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=9177.677s">Yeah,</a> it was a lot of the clerks there just taking in these handwritten cards and just typing in names, and it seemed like it was taking them five minutes.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=9188.142s">Yeah,</a> and I was just kind of looking at it like, okay, I hope that this can be done better, but obviously it's a state-run system then.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=10033.432s">This</a> is my favorite presentation so far.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=10133.098s">What</a> are their names?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=10884.585s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=10885.305s">It's</a> clear that you've been busy since you started here, and we're very grateful to have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=10890.607s">Is</a> it two questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=10892.748s">First,</a> is it logistically possible either technically or administratively to connect to get the school system as well onto the same Internet connection, potentially for more savings? <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=10909.733s">You</a> mentioned their Medford City Hall, <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=10913.694s">library</a> and some other place that wasn't the public schools.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=10994.668s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=10995.629s">Second</a> question. <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=10996.33s">What</a> was the $131 spent on a part-time employee?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=11807.196s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=11809.122s">So</a> hypothetically, if we did have a city solicitor, how much do you think it would decrease the line some of the line items here as well? <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=11820.26s">So</a> how much would so. <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=11823.803s">KB</a> law, it sounds like from what you're saying would be necessary, even in the case that we did have a city solicitor for more specialized services, how much of the services that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=11836.071s">They're</a> providing now, and an approximate dollar amount, do you think could be done by by in house legal?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=11927.085s">Something</a> that rewards institutional knowledge, which would be acquired over a period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=11933.85s">So</a> I would guess initially they'd be relying on KP law a good amount.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=11942.197s">But</a> it also sounds like from what you're saying, FOIA requests and whatnot, you're personally handling a lot of the tasks that would otherwise fall on in-house legal counsel.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zI7b343mLuM&t=11958.043s">I'm</a> sorry, I misheard that.<h2><a href="../2024-06-01_kB9FUBQF7vM/2024-06-01_kB9FUBQF7vM.html">City Council Resident Services And Public Engagement Committee 05-15-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=0.169s">This</a> is a subcommittee meeting of the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee dedicated to scheduling and hashing out listening sessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=13.793s">So</a> I guess the purpose of this is just to spend a little bit of time trying to figure out what groups we are specifically going to reach out to, when, what the best times would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=24.776s">So</a> if any of my fellow subcommittee members have any ideas, feel free to take it away.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=74.401s">So</a> sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=75.702s">I</a> mean, yeah.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=159.928s">So</a> is there kind of a gist that you might have for that?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=246.255s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=248.26s">So</a> I think feel free to send that to all of the council when you have that figured out. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=255.163s">And</a> also, this is only three of us, so we don't need to have the chair recognize some of this.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=406.56s">So,</a> okay, so go ahead and send around that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=412.422s">That</a> sheet, but so, I guess, in terms of. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=416.283s">How</a> that work, how that works out sort of in practice, I'm just kind of thinking of the upcoming 1 on the. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=423.265s">31st</a> that Councilor was are on our schedule to go to. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=427.007s">I</a> think that that's sort of just in the context of like a. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=431.788s">senior</a> center's regular coffee hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=435.209s">What</a> I'm thinking about right now is just in terms of organizing the listening sessions and what they'll actually look like when we're going to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=445.513s">For</a> certain groups, if it's like a super organized listening session, like people were brought together for that specific purpose, I imagine that could work out. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=455.336s">But</a> if it's two city councilors who are showing up to a regularly scheduled coffee hour, <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=461.098s">go</a> into like a chitchat sort of a thing as well, which, yeah, go ahead.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=593.62s">Yeah,</a> so what I'm, okay, I'm just, I'm just sort of thinking about the logistics that we'll be going through when we actually schedule these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=604.745s">So</a> there's, so we definitely need a, you know, a point person in the communities, which obviously we have five community liaisons. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=615.189s">agreed</a> to discuss seniors, vets, and then high school and tough students as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=620.395s">I'm</a> thinking that probably the flow of these things is going to be, we scheduled the next one, which May 31st in this case. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=628.925s">The</a> Councilors that go there take notes, they report back at the next resident services and public engagement committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=636.269s">what</a> they discussed, just try to offer as succinctly as possible, maybe 10 minutes during a session, what was talked about, what people were telling them, and then schedule the next one. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=655.194s">and</a> then just kind of keep doing that for about, you know, the rest of the term, so.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=699.92s">Can</a> you just, is it okay to just pass it around, like email to everybody in this meeting and just include it in the minutes as a, uh, if I send it to you right now, can you send it to us to look at right now?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=717.495s">Or</a> just share it on your screen, or yeah, just share it with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=720.335s">I</a> could put it on the screen in Zoom or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=723.536s">That's</a> helpful.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=742.967s">Whichever.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=815.164s">Should</a> be myself and Councilor Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=821.79s">So</a> at the last resident services meeting, it was agreed that <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=826.054s">Basically,</a> the chair would just check in with everybody and figure out who's available for what it becomes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=833.356s">And</a> then we 2 Councilors would be sent to each of these sessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=837.997s">It</a> becomes a little bit of a. Problem and set theory to not violate open meeting law with 2 Councilors because. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=847.879s">Basically,</a> only 1 person from this subcommittee can actually attend those while the subcommittee still exists. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=855.065s">Then.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=856.407s">Councilor</a> Lazzaro or Councilor can just attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=861.791s">I</a> think they have a little bit more flexibility not being on the subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=866.436s">And</a> then. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=869.206s">then</a> Council President Bears and then Council Vice President Collins are also even have even more freedom to go to any of the listening sessions, just not being on the resident services meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=884.396s">It</a> becomes a little bit more constrained with us three being on this subcommittee because no two of us can attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=892.141s">Yes,</a> Councilor Callahan.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=993.15s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=995.451s">So</a> Councilor Callahan, once you email the document when you're ready, but in the meantime, is there any other business other than figuring out who specifically is going to reach out to which groups?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1015.359s">It's</a> seniors, seniors, vets, high school and tough students, and then the five reps, the five community liaisons. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1026.451s">So</a> which is Portuguese, Haitian, Arabic, Spanish, and I forget what the fifth group.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1049.719s">I</a> didn't, okay, so you just sent it, so I'll wait a little bit for the email once it does come through.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1198.624s">Yeah,</a> I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1200.285s">I</a> was recording some of that, but I started looking through the document that you sent, which I just received just now. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1207.008s">So</a> I would appreciate if Councilor Tseng would forgive my lapse in attention.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1265.393s">Sorry,</a> so I have 10 groups total because Justin, Councilor Tseng just added Asian American communities to the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1273.46s">Yeah,</a> ICCM. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1274.501s">Asian.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1364.752s">I</a> actually do have a graphic that shows where historically city council has been represented in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1381.63s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1383.07s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1383.35s">So</a> do you think it would be productive to try to figure out what the next couple of listening sessions we're going to try to schedule over the next couple of months after the senior center and who's going to take charge of them would be?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1440.157s">Yeah,</a> so in terms of assigning who's going to handle which, I think there are a few obvious ones that I can think of. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1447.4s">So</a> I would handle vets. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1450.161s">I</a> think Justin would handle high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1452.922s">Tufts</a> would be handled by our esteemed counsel, Vice President Collins.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1462.047s">I</a> mean, yeah, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1463.569s">I</a> was just thinking about Tufts because she's an alum and I can't think of anybody else. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1467.293s">You</a> would do Tufts? <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1469.074s">I</a> could do Tufts, yeah.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1475.161s">Yeah,</a> just a few of the... I was just trying to think of the more obvious.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1521.045s">Yeah,</a> I'm just, I'm just writing them down for my own. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1523.887s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1525.648s">I'm</a> just like trying to. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1528.93s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1529.27s">So</a> Justin, oh wait, so sorry, Justin, you said the Asian speaking community liaison addition to high school students and tough students. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1539.016s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1540.737s">Arabic.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1542.27s">Wait,</a> but you said, is there an Asian American liaison?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1556.496s">But</a> that adds to number 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1558.096s">So</a> would you?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1598.533s">Okay,</a> so that leaves the Haitian community liaison, I believe.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1633.735s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1634.375s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1635.325s">Okay,</a> so I'll leave Anna with Haitian because Justin already has three. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1639.787s">So</a> right now the divisions I have between the nine original groups that were assigned were, Emily has already scheduled something with the seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1649.07s">Justin</a> has high school students, tough students, and the Arabic community liaisons. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1653.292s">I</a> have vets, veterans, and the Portuguese community liaison. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1659.314s">And</a> Anna has Spanish speaking, African American, <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1663.516s">Haitian</a> and the West Medford Community Center community liaisons.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1723.695s">Well,</a> that leaves Justin with four, me with two. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1726.338s">Let's</a> see if we're trying to divide it equally among the groups.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1756.068s">That</a> makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1757.495s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1758.015s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1758.276s">So</a> the final listing, Anna has Spanish speaking, African-American, uh, the West Medford community center, ICCM. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1765.96s">I</a> have the vets, Portuguese community liaison and Haitian community liaison, Justin high school students, tough students, Arabic speaking community liaisons. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1775.446s">And</a> obviously council is already scheduled something with the seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1779.168s">So</a> yeah.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1781.25s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1782.628s">Cool.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1784.229s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1785.469s">That</a> appears to be that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1789.491s">So</a> is there any other order of business in the seven minutes between now and the start of the Committee of the Whole meeting?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1798.719s">Yes,</a> sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1800.1s">Okay,</a> Continuous Town Halls.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1857.914s">This</a> does seem to be kind of getting into more like campaign strategy in certain parts of the document.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1889.198s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1889.598s">Would</a> it be possible to have what, to get like an edited version of the document where you kind of just take in the listening session stuff and then leave out the.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1962.993s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1963.393s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1964.954s">So</a> do we need to turn any thing that was discussed so far in this committee into an official motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1972.358s">Or</a> are we?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1988.987s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1989.908s">Cool.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1991.809s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1992.23s">So,</a> so otherwise, yeah, I have, I wrote down who's assigned to what and yeah, do we have any motions on the floor? <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=1999.855s">Motion.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kB9FUBQF7vM&t=2000.816s">Oh,</a> okay.

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=2328.594s">I</a> would like to refer to the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee mainly because that primarily covers Veterans Affairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=2334.9s">I've</a> also invited over the Veterans Services Director, Veronica Shaw, for this, but essentially this is a paper that would allow the Veterans Services Director to establish a program <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=2350.262s">under</a> which she may offer monetary incentives to landlords who choose to rent out to qualified veterans. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=2360.564s">I've</a> been asking KP Law for legal advice around this, as well as talking with the city's chief of staff around this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=2370.667s">So</a> yeah, I would motion to refer to the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3652.398s">I</a> have Google Maps open right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3654.8s">I</a> could share. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3655.32s">Yeah,</a> I was trying to pull it up.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3658.222s">Yeah,</a> I think that's so.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3878.862s">Director</a> Hahn, just for clarification, what board would grant the special permit? <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3886.044s">Would</a> it be this one or the Community Development Board? <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3888.804s">Or</a> where would they get that?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3939.12s">Council</a> President, I also have an additional question. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3942.624s">Just</a> to clarify on a point that was brought up by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3946.589s">So</a> he stated that if there's room that's taken up to display cars, the four cars that you intend to sell, there will be less <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3954.919s">space</a> that would be used to repair the cars or to work on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3960.683s">What</a> are your thoughts on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3962.564s">Are</a> you just not using that space within your shop right now to fix cars or what's the space currently being used for?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3986.753s">Okay,</a> so you don't use the space that you're proposing to use to display cars for anything, correct?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=3993.737s">Okay,</a> just to clarify that part.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4673.506s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4675.404s">Yeah,</a> I would also just like to say, I go to Pinky's a good amount here and there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4682.929s">What</a> I do like about it is the fact that they do have a temporary parking spot just off Summer Street that's right in front of the store. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4692.415s">So</a> just the idea that drivers would just come there really quickly, get pizza, and then go back with very little fuss makes a lot of sense to me visually. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4703.223s">So</a> I could see that, but obviously, <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4706.164s">hear</a> from the neighbors and the houses directly surrounding there, but you know, y'all make very good pizza. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=4714.287s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6000.713s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Scarpelli, so I, I do I do support this, this resolution, I did some googling on this prior to the meeting you know there were stories of homeowners falling behind on property tax payments the city seizing an entire house worth, you know, 400,000 plus dollars to pay off $150,000 debt just <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6024.704s">keeping</a> the difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6025.544s">So</a> my question has to do more with, so I couldn't find online, and this could just be a failure of Googling on my part, Senate docket number 2129, or the relevant bills in the state house that were supporting this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6041.952s">And</a> I also would like to see a <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6045.033s">It</a> mentions here to send a letter to support our state legislators. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6050.274s">I</a> would like to see a draft of that letter personally, or just some idea of the specific legislation in the state House and Senate, if there is any.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6953.941s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6954.561s">This</a> is basically a resolution to address some of the concerns brought up at the last council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6963.866s">The</a> idea behind this is pretty simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6965.427s">We've</a> discussed the newsletter very extensively and <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6969.449s">regular</a> council so far and the resident services public engagement committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6974.253s">The</a> idea behind this is basically just to have it as an agenda item during those meetings in which we plan to draft and finalize and release the newsletter. <a href="https://youtu.be/iBf2dgSfOhY&t=6986.021s">So</a> I would motion to send this to the resident services and public to reverse to the resident services and public engagement committee.<h2><a href="../2024-06-01_ziPfbtXDJSA/2024-06-01_ziPfbtXDJSA.html">City Council Planning and Permitting Committee 05-08-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=742.165s">Sorry,</a> this is just a general question, and this could be addressed by either Danielle or Alicia. <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=748.026s">I</a> just have a general question about the importance of really getting the definitions right, because it has been mentioned a few times. <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=754.968s">So</a> what is some of the complications and the consequence of having unclear definitions that you all have seen in the past that mean that we need to <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=767.43s">really</a> focusing on this right now and I'm asking that mainly just to get a just to get a better understanding myself of the process.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=962.233s">Oh,</a> absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=963.714s">Just,</a> you know, I was, I mean, having consistency across all of our zoning in terms of definitions is definitely something I understand, but I was just curious about what the real world consequences of having unclear definitions have been in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=981.585s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3100.787s">Canine</a> daycare perhaps.

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=3163.048s">Motion</a> to change it to doggy daycare.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4242.295s">Don't</a> wanna have you all repeat what you just said, but just kind of a basic question about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4248.179s">I</a> think it was one of you might've told me about that landlord in Somerville who just kind of kept on renting, like stuffing tenants into the same place and then charging them a thousand a month for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4259.026s">And</a> that just kept adding up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4261.628s">So</a> the two questions are, how often do you see things like that happening? <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=4273.016s">just</a> in your positions and what can this definition do practically to help you prevent that from happening in the future?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5502.753s">That's</a> infill zoning, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5504.334s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5505.575s">That's</a> gonna be part of this?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5610.225s">just</a> a technical thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5611.606s">So</a> I think at the end of this is going to say that we're going to start talking about ADUs pretty like pretty soon after this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ziPfbtXDJSA&t=5619.428s">So</a> I so will it and I'm not I'm not sure if the will the definition of tiny home necessarily be settled by the time we actually get to the ADU discussion because tiny homes are as it says here a part of they can be an ADU.

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=0.251s">Oh,</a> Matt Leming here. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=2.712s">This</a> is the first video slash blog post that I'm doing post-election. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=8.914s">So</a> we just had a local election in which ballot questions six, seven, and eight were on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=18.097s">To</a> recap, this was a question to <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=22.058s">fund</a> the building of a new fire headquarters, which is question six. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=26.2s">Question</a> seven was to put three million dollars towards the Medford public school system to level fund it, and five hundred thousand dollars to the Department of Public Works to let them hire a permanent road repair crew. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=41.867s">And</a> question eight was to put an additional four million dollars towards the Medford public school system to invest in things like arts and vocational programs and additional money for <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=51.451s">teacher</a> salaries, basically things to keep it competitive and improve and invest in the future of the Medford public school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=60.08s">So</a> the results of the elections came in. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=62.923s">Questions</a> 7 and 8 passed and question 6 failed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=67.648s">The</a> margins were pretty narrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=69.892s">So</a> question 7 passed with, this is the unofficial tally, it's not the official certified tally, but with the unofficial tally it was 14,847 for and 13,304 votes against. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=87.008s">Question</a> 8 passed with 14,664 and 13,518 against. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=89.75s">And</a> question 6 failed with 13,458 for and 13,965 against. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=93.033s">So</a> the ballot questions 7 and 8 passed with about 52% of the vote and question 6 failed about 49 to 51. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=116.917s">So</a> obviously I would have liked to see question 6 pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=126.593s">The</a> fact that the leadership of the firefighter union came out against it was most certainly what killed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=134.46s">I</a> think that there was probably a corpus of about a thousand voters or so who supported the ballot measures level funding the schools, but decided to go with the leadership of the fire union and kill the <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=150.737s">funding</a> for the fire headquarters. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=152.138s">So</a> I'm not really sure what the future of that project will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=159.104s">I</a> think that personally, I think that the next ballot, the next debt exclusion that we'll need to see is about is going to be for the new high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=170.574s">That's</a> coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=171.314s">That's</a> coming in the future, probably in the next couple of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=175.297s">And</a> that's really going to need to be the priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=180.12s">It's</a> a very expensive project. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=182.341s">The</a> Massachusetts School Building Authority will likely put a good chunk of funding for it, but the remainder will need to be paid for by the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=190.646s">And</a> the way that you do that is with a debt exclusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=196.87s">So</a> these results are pretty unusual, just in the sense that typically it's overrides that fail. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=209.925s">You</a> know, I did a lot of combing through the data, combing through the previous override votes that have gone through different municipalities since 1980. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=225.041s">They</a> have about a 41% passage rate overall, and during presidential election years, in the November general election, they have about a 35% passage rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=236.454s">So</a> this was pretty unusual, all things considered. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=240.018s">It</a> was really stacked against it, especially since this is Medford's first time having an override. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=245.563s">Debt</a> exclusions actually have closer to an 89% passage rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=250.887s">And</a> that's interesting, I don't actually know why that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=253.809s">I</a> think it's because when voters are looking at something on the ballot, like a building is something that you can physically imagine is going to be there, and debt exclusions are also temporary, so that's slightly more appealing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=268.318s">Typically,</a> whereas with <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=271.926s">overrides,</a> you know, when you're talking about things like teacher, teacher salaries, staff salaries, operating budgets, it's less tangible, it's something people can't really see. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=281.953s">We</a> were getting a lot of people commenting saying, you know, oh, you should be able to balance the budget, you should be able to, you know, work creatively with less, things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=294.683s">That's</a> not really something that we can't, you can do after a certain point. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=299.186s">If</a> a budget's just <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=301.42s">shrinking</a> and shrinking over time, especially when it's as small as Medford's, that's something that's really not feasible after a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=311.365s">The</a> override campaign, the team that was for the overrides passing really made this clear, and I think the messaging was very much like, our tax rates are extremely low, our operating budget is very small, <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=330.013s">After</a> a certain point if someone is starving, you can't just tell them to stop starving and then give them less food You need to actually give them food in order for them to survive and get better and that's something that That's really the situation that Medford was in Obviously, you know, obviously the votes were the vote was closer than I think most of us were expecting We didn't see <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=359.163s">You</a> know, I don't think any pollster really was able to effectively account for, you know, the sort of red wave that swept across a nation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=367.948s">Donald</a> Trump was elected to a second term and he won all the swing states. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=374.492s">And</a> I think we were also seeing that kind of shift happen within the very local elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=384.726s">Which,</a> going into it, I had a good feeling that these would pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=395.598s">I</a> was kind of thinking that it would be more like 60 40. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=399.419s">Um,</a> just given what I was seeing, given what folks were telling me at the doors, um, the fact that it was closer to like 52 48 did make me a little bit nervous, but it's also, I think it's, I think it's also, uh, just is really a Testament to the strength of the organizing team. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=418.386s">Uh,</a> the fact that we were able to, um, you know, the fact that, <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=423.606s">There</a> were so many parents and so many people who wanted to see an investment in their children's future, who were willing to put in so much of their time into this, and just really come up with a more positive message than what we were seeing otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=438.179s">Talking</a> about <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=444.905s">The</a> opposition is a little bit tricky because I didn't want to do that so much during the campaign. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=453.23s">Just</a> kind of giving air to the opposition's platform was usually just not good practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=458.473s">I</a> feel like now that everything is passed and we know what the vote totals are, I have a little bit more leeway to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=467.038s">But</a> it was something that we were dealing with pretty consistently, so <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=474.757s">Like,</a> I think what the opposition was going for was just a very targeted misinformation campaign. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=484.183s">You</a> know, and this was that <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=489.523s">ended</a> up undercutting them in the long term, because it worked with some of the population, like some of the electorate, but others just ended up realizing that they were being lied to very consistently. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=503.928s">And</a> I think there's a lot of smaller instances of this happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=508.369s">For</a> instance, their mailer said that it was a $37.5 million tax increase, which <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=515.506s">It</a> is, if you use crazy math, the actual increase would have been about $9.5 million a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=520.754s">The</a> $37.5 million number is not anything that actually exists in reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=531.033s">There's</a> also the whole free cash thing that they just kept repeating, which is basically they're saying that we don't actually have to have this tax increase, we could just pay for an override increase through our savings account, which is, again, that's not a thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=549.337s">You</a> can't just perpetually take money from your savings account, because then you just spend down your savings, and then you're left with zero dollars in the bank, and that's just not a good way to run a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=560.82s">And</a> this was explained dozens and dozens of times throughout the campaign. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=564.463s">We</a> did it in city council meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=565.904s">We</a> did it in, uh, you know, I did it in letters to the editor, but it was just something that they just kept repeating, which is, it's a messaging strategy. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=575.272s">You</a> know, if you just keep repeating a simple lie, eventually people will believe it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=578.994s">It's</a> propaganda. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=580.155s">So</a> I understood, I understood what they were going for. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=582.097s">Uh,</a> and I also think that there are legit, there are legitimate reasons to, <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=587.076s">the</a> override. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=587.697s">If</a> you're a senior on fixed income, that is definitely <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=596.531s">That's</a> definitely a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=599.093s">The</a> City Council, we're doing what we can to help people in that situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=608.138s">So</a> we're passing the maximum exemptions we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=611.8s">I'm</a> working on a program to give a housing incentive for veterans with a non-profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=619.764s">But</a> at a certain point, you just can't <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=621.952s">work</a> with a budget that continuously shrinks due to inflation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=627.377s">It's</a> just eventually every city will need an override and Medford was one of the last to do it so that's just that's just the situation we're in. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=638.388s">The</a> opposition campaign, I know something about the leadership of them, just because I pay attention to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=643.834s">I</a> think they kind of tried to make it an anonymous thing as much as possible, but I was kind of aware of some of the people who were involved in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=653.524s">It's</a> mainly a combination of former <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=657.148s">like</a> old guard politicians and former political candidates who just really do not like to see a progressive majority on city council and so they're just kind of this doing everything you possibly can to oppose that because you know obviously they're gonna try to run their own <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=675.563s">Candidates</a> and they want to weaken the current The people who are currently in office and just kind of make a ruckus around that as much as possible So that's obviously going on and then other people that were also involved in the leadership were of the of the opposition campaign were really just a couple of out-of-town developers and real estate agents who own literally millions of dollars in property like, you know, I looked it up on a <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=705.262s">I</a> looked it up online a lot of the people like a few of the people that are Listed as being on leadership of the override campaign on literally millions of dollars in property. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=713.349s">They</a> just don't want to see it taxed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=715.091s">So</a> There's I there was lip service kind of being paid to you know, some of the fixed income folk that were that are going to be affected by this but the people that were designing the messaging I don't think I <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=732.138s">I</a> don't think they honestly cared about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=734.341s">I</a> think that they really just want to, they're really just trying to find a pretense to oppose the people who are currently in office at all costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=745.034s">So</a> yeah, my opinions on that are a little bit... <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=750.635s">are</a> a little bit complicated because I do have like I do understand that anytime you come up with a tax increase it's not going to be It's not going to be kind of an ideal Sort of trade-off like you know you are people are going to be affected by it But on the other hand long term you just can't have a city budget that keeps shrinking And you can't just lay off 40 teachers and allow cuts to keep happening to our educational system. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=778.543s">That's</a> not a <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=779.383s">that's</a> not a way to run a city, and nobody else was actually proposing a clear solution to this that we didn't refute 2,400 times. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=787.806s">And</a> so yeah, I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=793.658s">Basically</a> the messaging of the pro campaign was just a lot better We were Generally working a lot harder We were more successful at fundraising And the odds just statistically the odds are really stacked against this happening, you know again, you had a huge red wave go across like coming across the country and And <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=823.962s">Yeah,</a> that generally means that when that happens, that there will be more people that are opposed to any tax increases happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=834.788s">But</a> I'm personally relieved that this happened, just because it means that we won't have to lay off a lot of teachers next year, and we actually will be able to see more investment in the public school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=852.593s">Yeah,</a> moving, so moving forward, what I also learned was that, you know, just running these local campaigns can be, can be a very stressful thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=864.721s">Like</a> I was just putting a lot of my personal time into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=868.343s">I</a> hope that the next time that I have to do this, it won't be quite so, <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=878.169s">quite</a> as much of an intensive process. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=880.251s">I</a> guess the first time we would ever try to pass these ballot measures, you know, you're trying something new, it would be, it'll be difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=892.319s">But</a> again, we are likely going to have to have a debt exclusion for the high school in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=896.062s">The</a> people currently in office and who are working on coming up with the plans for that high school made that very clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=902.906s">So</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=906.863s">But</a> yeah, so other things happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=909.664s">So,</a> you know, obviously, um, the red wave happened, uh, about something. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=916.886s">I'd</a> have to look at the exact number. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=918.686s">I</a> think something like 20, 25% of Medford, um, voted for, uh, voted for Donald Trump. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=925.948s">Massachusetts</a> is like the, uh, the second bluest state only to Vermont. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=931.07s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=932.848s">in</a> the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=934.829s">And</a> just like every other progressive politician, I've been thinking about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=940.593s">So</a> I consider myself a progressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=942.554s">I'm</a> also probably more in the moderate category than a lot of other politicians. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=948.338s">So</a> I'm the secretary of the Medford Democratic City and Ward Committees as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=956.443s">Longer</a> term, so, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=961.139s">Everybody's</a> trying to come up with their own take on sort of the on sort of the election I think the pollsters were saying that it was 50-50, but you know what we actually saw was again Trump really take everything like take all of the take most of the battleground states. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=978.533s">I</a> mean I'm more convinced that this was a Just a <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=988.156s">an</a> effect of a very bad post-COVID economy that affected most incumbent administrations. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=997.54s">So</a> there's a YouTuber who I linked to in my blog post who talked about the best and worst post-election takes, and I tended to agree with him. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=1009.986s">He</a> came up with two post-election takes on what happened that I thought were <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=1014.868s">reasonable.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=1015.488s">The</a> first was just that pretty much every incumbent government globally lost re-election this past year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=1024.091s">The</a> UK saw the Labour Party oust the Tory government for the first time since Tony Blair. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=1036.118s">Meanwhile,</a> every other incumbent government, whether or not they're left or right, has also been kind of following the same pattern. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=1042.864s">So</a> I tend to take that view on things, which is just that this was a bad time for anybody in office to be kind of holding the ball while inflation was as high as it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=1054.334s">I</a> also think that <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=1057.692s">Given</a> that, you know, Trump's in office again, we're probably going to see a lot of progressive organizing happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=1065.935s">I</a> think there will be a heightened interest in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=1068.295s">From</a> 2016 to 2020, we just saw a ton of <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=1073.117s">that</a> happening, a lot of people started to take an interest in local politics, got really involved in their community, and whenever you have someone who comes in, like, whenever, you know, your party has an office, you get pretty complacent. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=1089.428s">I</a> think that <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=1090.975s">The</a> progressives on council did see this happening during our terms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=1099.421s">I</a> think that when you have progressives have 6 out of 7 seats, then you do tend to get a little bit <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=1108.927s">Then</a> we we have been seeing Folks get a little bit complacent about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=1113.428s">I</a> think that the sort of Contention in this past the local elections that we just saw definitely mobilized a lot of people because they saw like, okay You know, you got folks elected. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=1123.891s">You</a> can't just kind of Leave them there You need to you know, continue it like show continuing support for the folks that you elect while they're trying to govern and <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=1137.275s">Um,</a> so I, so, you know, I think that it's. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=1143.92s">You</a> know, again, I'm a Democrat, so I don't really have that much of a positive outlook on where things are gonna be going, but I do think that it will really get people to pay a lot more attention to local politics, and it will get people to pay, to really be encouraged to get involved, and kind of like not be, <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=1170.995s">So</a> yeah, that's my take on what's sort of been happening in Medford over the past couple of months, as well as <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=1182.343s">nationally.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=1182.964s">I'm</a> probably not able to offer as much insight on the national stuff as some other folks, but I am very proud of the fact that we were able to get these passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=1196.695s">I</a> do, you know, understand that it's a pretty slim margin, so I think that probably reaching out to <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=1206.219s">other</a> folks in the community, especially those without as much computer access in different crowds that we have been engaging would be wise for the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=1215.144s">Seniors,</a> especially, tend to not look at their computers as much. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=1219.647s">They</a> get more information by word of mouth. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=1223.09s">So</a> really engaging with that community going forward will be pretty essential. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=1232.323s">But</a> yeah, so that is my post-election take. <a href="https://youtu.be/XAi78zu0WWM&t=1237.248s">Thank</a> you all very much for your continuing support and have a wonderful day.<h2><a href="../2024-06-01_yQHm3T4_jqM/2024-06-01_yQHm3T4_jqM.html">City Council Resident Services And Public Engagement Committee 05-07-24</a></h2>

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1909.969s">Is</a> it, this is just a question coming from a councilor going through his first budget process, but is it typical in other cities to have between 10 to 15% of the city's budget going towards health and or life insurance? <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1925.039s">Like,</a> is that it? <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1925.819s">That's</a> the biggest ticket items. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1927.24s">That's</a> typical, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=1928.961s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3162.549s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3163.109s">So</a> I know we've talked about this a little bit just over the phone, but I'd like to, one thing that I'm personally concerned with is just the amount of vacant buildings around Medford, vacant storefronts and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3175.68s">So,</a> and I've been looking into <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3180.242s">that</a> would allow the city to hopefully get a slightly better grasp on that problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3185.884s">Can</a> you talk a little bit about what extra technology or staff capacity the building commission would need in order to keep better track of the vacant buildings in the city and, you know, who owns them and what could possibly be done about that?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3264.814s">And</a> is there capacity to have a public interface of the vacant of vacant properties and people who may be interested in reaching out to the owners of them for. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=3275.512s">business</a> opportunities could get in contact with them directly.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=4161.141s">Oh,</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=4161.422s">Most</a> of my questions were answered in the succeeding conversation.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=4370.215s">a</a> lot of this is in the fee schedule and appendix A, I also did. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=4374.276s">There's</a> also a motion to request that legal advice as to whether the fee schedule could just be automatically updated in later years based on some index of inflation. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=4387.641s">I</a> think that we have a lot of legal questions coming out of council these days, so I was following up. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=4397.984s">with</a> the city's legal advisors and trying to get a specific answer to that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=4406.991s">The</a> turnaround time is always a little bit long for those, but it is in the works. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=4413.796s">Did</a> you ever receive the request from this council?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=4417.839s">I</a> did.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=4428.508s">And</a> to your knowledge, were there fees that hadn't been collected in the past? <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=4434.077s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=4514.557s">ballpark</a> and it's totally fine if you don't have this number, but like how much revenue do you think was lost by those practices annually, if you can even provide?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=6688.339s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=6689.279s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PaKgR4OfzgE&t=6689.639s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-06-01_TWmAoWQ2xQE/2024-06-01_TWmAoWQ2xQE.html">City Council 04-30-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1130.302s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1131.003s">So</a> at the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee, we first discussed the first April newsletter of the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1138.529s">So</a> I sent copies around of that or drafts around that to all of my fellow council members and flagged down potential edits to those, as well as a schedule that Councilors would go by month to month to draft the newsletter prior to submitting it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1157.165s">to</a> the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1157.966s">Most</a> of the committee session was dedicated to editing the newsletter, so it was a bit of a bit of a Word document session as I took in edits and suggestions in real time and tried to correct my own draft language there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1176.158s">Following</a> that, there was a <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1178.98s">motion</a> to send the newsletter to regular session, but that motion didn't receive a second, so we decided to, so we ended up voting on a motion to approve the newsletter entirely and send it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1196.249s">So</a> it was, so the first draft of it is currently on the Medford City Council page. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1201.671s">We're</a> currently discussing <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1203.416s">methods</a> of circulating that around the community with the communications director and the clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1209.123s">Additionally,</a> we voted to establish listening sessions, ended up voting to establish the subcommittee consisting of myself, Councilor Callahan and Councilor Tseng to <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1221.149s">organize</a> those in order to establish monthly listening sessions in which a few City Council members would meet up with the community of seniors, the community of tough students, veterans, as well as the five community liaisons in Medford in order to have City Council do active outreach to different members of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=1251.489s">And,</a> yeah, that was pretty much all we discussed.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2520.26s">How</a> much does business differ from Monday to Thursday versus the weekend, Friday, Saturday and Sunday? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2526.464s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2529.092s">Yeah,</a> like how much to share your figures, but yeah, just yeah, just just ballpark, like how much more people you see on the weekends versus the weekdays.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2563.506s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2564.146s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2564.427s">So</a> the Friday and Saturday hours would be the ones that would help that business the most?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2568.771s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2569.351s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2570.512s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=2570.873s">Any</a> further questions for the petitioner?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4391.224s">and</a> just to say a couple things about the CPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4394.326s">So</a> I'm not sure where the 25% number came from. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4398.388s">I</a> believe on the CPA, the minimum is 10% for open spaces, historic preservation, and affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4405.291s">Now</a> I understand that Cambridge requires 80% to go to affordable housing, but I believe that the reason that they do that is because they have money coming from other sources for historic preservation and open spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4418.977s">So</a> their operating budget is about <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4420.858s">five</a> times the size of Medford, they do have more money to throw around for, you know, building a playground or repairing a church or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4432.609s">So</a> I think that the use of CPA money within Medford is a little bit different from the use of CPA money within other communities, especially Cambridge, which, again, has a lot more funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4443.939s">And</a> the same really goes with Harvard and Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4446.801s">So</a> Harvard's endowment, like you were saying, is above $50 billion. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4449.823s">Tufts</a> is $2.4 billion. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4451.785s">So</a> when we're talking about money here, it's like Cambridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=4456.548s">And</a> I do admire a lot of what Cambridge has done with affordable housing, but we're really talking about another order of magnitude in terms of funding.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6741.206s">Yes,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6742.246s">I</a> would like to emphasize the point that there was a motion that Councilor Tseng was absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6747.03s">He</a> was on vacation at the moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6749.251s">So</a> there are four people of the five committee members of the most recent Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee Councilors Scarpelli through the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6756.517s">You</a> let your objections to the newsletter be known, which were you consistently let everybody on this body note since we've been discussing the newsletter. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6764.662s">Um.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6765.603s">But</a> then at 8 34 PM, you then left the meeting without notifying anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6771.148s">And</a> because of that, like I was chair, so I didn't think it was appropriate to second motion from the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6777.494s">And</a> obviously, Councilor Callahan disagreed with the motion to send it to the regular, um, to the floor because there was the opinion that the perfect cannot, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6790.51s">be</a> good, can't be the enemy of the perfect, whichever way that goes, and that we needed to get a newsletter out in a timely way. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6797.213s">If</a> you had decided to stay at the meeting and attend these meetings consistently, we would be debating this at the floor.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6804.737s">Apologies.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6806.258s">If</a> Councilor Scriabelli had decided to stay at the meeting and hear the rest of the discussion, then we would be voting on the newsletter on the floor right now, and I hope that in the future, resident services and public engagement committees <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6817.827s">We</a> can do that second. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6819.369s">I</a> know that it just in response to some of the discussion about public fear and outrage in response to some of these, I would like to point out that a lot of the more recent <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6834.468s">concerns</a> and emails that we've been seeing were the result of a text sent around to many other, to most residents in the city, or a huge number of them from the Greater Boston Real Estate Board, which has obviously consistently opposed these measures in other cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6848.619s">So</a> I think that that should be noted. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6853.743s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6854.163s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=6856.725s">Councilor</a> Callahan.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7463.104s">I'd</a> also just like to point out a few things about the process, since this is a resolution to discuss City Council subcommittee processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7470.665s">So</a> what we're doing in the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee is we have a continuing resolution, which is a resolution to innovate in the City Council's communication processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7486.168s">And</a> so that basically means that we come up with <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7489.029s">a</a> number of ideas, one of which is the newsletter. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7491.53s">And</a> so in earlier committee meetings, we had motioned and agreed to, as a committee, come up with a schedule by which people draft the newsletter, and then every month have a different city councilor, not necessarily somebody on the committee, if they want to volunteer and have the time to put forward a draft of the newsletter, which would then be edited at a committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7512.424s">So</a> if there are concerns, I mean, I think that the, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7518.608s">Vagueness</a> of resolutions or the specificity with which individual papers say that we're going to, you know, do X, Y or Z in committee is a continuing concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7529.118s">Obviously,</a> that's been a concern with this with this very agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7533.562s">But</a> if it does make, I mean, we obviously can bring forth a another. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7540.669s">resolution</a> that more specifically states that we're going to put out a newsletter every month via committee for consideration at the regular meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7550.738s">It's</a> just that with communications it is necessary to be timely and get something out there every month because events happen every month and we need to be consistent in our communications and <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7565.191s">we</a> get criticized for being intransparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7568.412s">And</a> the newsletter is a way to address that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7571.393s">So</a> it's important to be timely. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7573.474s">So</a> thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7576.215s">And</a> that's all I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=7577.276s">Councilor</a> Callahan.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8587.027s">I</a> said no. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8588.348s">There's</a> another item. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8589.008s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8609.527s">Councilor</a> Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8611.069s">I'd</a> just like to point out that I second the motion because we still have to get to 24097, which actually discusses the home rule petitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=8619.114s">We</a> were still on the subcommittee processes and we hadn't been really discussing that, so that's all I have to say.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10387.907s">No,</a> when I've chaired meetings before, I've definitely like not noticed like which side of my or you just picked the hand that went up last. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10395.361s">No,</a> so just to be a bit more clear about the practicalities of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10399.463s">So</a> if the Affordable Homes Act does end up including a provision for us to implement a local option for a real estate transfer fee, the home rule petition proposal in Medford would be moot. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10412.207s">There</a> just wouldn't really be any point in filing that because we would then have, we would then have it by default what the state gives us. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10421.571s">So</a> we would likely have to file <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10424.472s">another</a> resolution into a regular meeting in that case and just drop the Home Rule petition if we do get it from the Affordable Homes Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10433.16s">So</a> hopefully that just clarifies sort of what the process looks like because <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10440.873s">The</a> 18 Home Rule petitions that have been filed, if you actually go and read them, and they're all on the State House website, they're all kind of slightly different and they're a little bit, they just have very different provisions depending on what individual city councils discussed at any given time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10458.681s">And</a> so if the Affordable Homes Act is passed, all of those would probably just be rejected. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10465.126s">outright</a> officially because then, you know, everybody would have what the state gave them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10471.953s">That</a> being said, just to, again, repeat what my colleagues have already stated, there is a definite point in filing these. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10481.135s">The</a> fact that 18 other communities all filed Home Rule petitions very likely is telling the State House that affordable housing is an issue, and all of that effort by local legislators then led up <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10494.878s">to</a> what Governor Healey's proposing with the Affordable Homes Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10498.26s">So</a> the relationship between local and state politics is often a bit of a black box, but yeah.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10675.332s">Justin,</a> can you try saying something? <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10678.133s">Can</a> you hear me?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10957.188s">Martha,</a> you could also try to click on the little arrow next to the microphone button. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10962.331s">It</a> could be that your input is wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10964.812s">So</a> sometimes Zoom selects a different input than what's the default on your computer. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWmAoWQ2xQE&t=10970.155s">So</a> that could be the issue.<h2><a href="../2024-06-01_Imw9nvnGj3M/2024-06-01_Imw9nvnGj3M.html">City Council Public Works and Facilities Committee 04-24-24</a></h2>

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=991.037s">To</a> be clear, I'm supportive of the electrification of vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=994.058s">That's</a> not the angle I'm coming at this from. <a href="https://youtu.be/Imw9nvnGj3M&t=996.138s">So</a> I just want to be clear about that.

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=944.414s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=945.374s">And</a> the second question, which is sort of related. <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=949.536s">So</a> I noticed the distinction between approval of a project by the community development board and sort of lower threshold for approval by just the planning department, the administrative review. <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=960.161s">And</a> one proposed change that I'm trying to make to the AD ordinances to sort of reduce that, just for instance, from a community development board <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=973.326s">review</a> in all cases to just administrate a review by the planning department. <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=976.928s">I</a> guess, are there other sort of, in your analysis of our ordinances so far, do you sort of notice other cases where something that normally would have a, would need a permit by the community development board would better be suited to just be reviewed at the staff level? <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=993.313s">I'm</a> just kind of thinking like smaller projects, maybe. <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=998.255s">What's</a> your sort of informal take on that so far?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=4304.302s">Yes,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=4305.743s">We</a> have, we recently instituted an affordable housing trust fund last year, which is about 30 years too late to be fair, but is there any, what are the usual sources of income for affordable housing trust funds that you know about so far? <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=4323.807s">We've</a> identified a few potentially, if the transfer fee goes through, that could be one, also CPA funds, and we were working on linkage fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=4333.177s">Are</a> there any other common sources of funding that you can think about?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=4398.006s">Many-</a> Sorry, what? <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=4398.807s">Cell</a> towers? <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=4399.548s">Cell</a> towers.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=4433.576s">You</a> said rental fees?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=4436.597s">Okay,</a> short-term rental fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=4437.717s">Yeah,</a> Airbnbs. <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=4439.477s">Okay,</a> so that's something that we're legally able to do is charge Airbnbs like 50% to put into the Affordable Housing Trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=4446.418s">But</a> we already charge fees.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=5237.134s">Uh,</a> yes, so question, so I saw I saw some of this happen when I was on the CPA and we're funding the walk link court redevelopment. <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=5246.678s">So,</a> you know, the CPA funds were a necessary requisite to get state and federal funding is there, but. <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=5255.407s">Part</a> of my concern with funding affordable housing this way is it does sort of mean that somebody trying to put together a funding package is just putting up a lot of overhead, keeping up with these different applications and the requirement of all these applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=5270.87s">Is</a> there any way, just at the local level, like possibly dispersing funds from an affordable housing trust that you can <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=5278.092s">feasibly</a> and without breaking the system, reduce the burden for people that are trying to apply for all these different grants just to fund the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=5288.157s">Just</a> your thoughts on that in general, I'd appreciate.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=5351.185s">No,</a> no, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=5353.406s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=5719.873s">Why</a> are insurance costs going up?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=6164.332s">Two</a> questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=6165.133s">The</a> first, what are recommendations that you would have for both making projects more predictable for developers, which is something you've touched on a few times in the presentation, and second, to decrease timelines, which is these delays can oftentimes disincentivize development completely. <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=6186.03s">So</a> I'd love to hear your thoughts on those two items.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=6326.803s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=6328.664s">Second</a> question, this is a little bit more big picture, but I would be interested to hear the thoughts of experts on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=6336.528s">So</a> I did read the Boston Globe Spotlight series on the fact that in greater Boston, one unit of housing costs between $500,000 and $600,000 to build. <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=6347.913s">I</a> have a blog, and I ended up quoting that article on that, and it was, you know, the reasons, of course, were very complicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=6355.579s">Fewer</a> people are going into construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=6357.761s">The</a> overseas cost of copper goes up. <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=6361.344s">Zoning</a> is too restrictive on the local level. <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=6364.066s">And</a> in general, the picture it seemed to be painting was that more and more developers are just having trouble making the equations work, which you sort of touched on here, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=6375.636s">What</a> is just your picture on how that's going to evolve? <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=6379.939s">Do</a> you think that it's going to hit the point where it's not going to be feasible at all to sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=6389.212s">build</a> any sort of affordable housing on the private market? <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=6392.654s">What</a> factors do you see that could potentially improve that? <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=6396.737s">I</a> know you mentioned greater, like the federal government taking this a bit more seriously than they have in the last 20 years, but just your thoughts on the feasibility of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=6407.665s">I'd</a> like to hear.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=6464.77s">So</a> the fact that a lot of companies have kind of made, put manufacturing overseas, which just makes things harder to help.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=6565.575s">What</a> areas has that been the most successful in the United States?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=6592.432s">Every</a> so often I'll read about like 3D printed apartments and whatnot on the news. <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=6597.48s">I</a> think that's probably a bit more of an extreme example of what you're talking about, but things like that I haven't seen quite as much around in the greater Boston area.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=6742.009s">And</a> one final question. <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=6745.73s">I</a> think one issue that we've been seeing in Medford, I know, but also pretty much like a lot of other areas of the United States is a large amount of investor capital going into the housing market and generally speaking, private <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=6761.478s">private</a> equity seeing real estate as a return on investment more than anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=6766.261s">And</a> one thing that I would like as a local politician as a way to sort of distinguish between people who actually live in their houses and even people who maybe live locally and own as opposed to a company out of New York that's making like a shell <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=6784.873s">that's</a> the company buying up a bunch of apartments and kicking out all the tenants, flipping them and jacking up the rents, which is something that is happening more and more regularly in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=6798.85s">Do</a> you know of any strategies that other communities have had this kind of like <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=6804.657s">fight</a> that general problem or any strategies of distinguishing between one kind of buyer that actually does plan to live in the home or at least will have a face-to-face relationship with the people that live in their homes as opposed to those who mainly just see it as an investment.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=6930.39s">There's</a> short term rentals are a big part of the problem, but it's also generally an investment, even in longer term luxury housing, as opposed to focus on affordable housing, mainly because luxury housing is seen as being more profitable. <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=6946.661s">So</a> is there?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9NPhwNPODcU&t=7312.978s">Motion</a> to adjourn?<h2><a href="../2024-06-01_0Eph4NzrdME/2024-06-01_0Eph4NzrdME.html">City Council Committee of the Whole 04-23-24</a></h2>

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=2343.294s">This</a> is more just a curiosity question, but with the health insurance, is there any possibility or is it feasible at all to switch health insurance providers or is that just a non-starter?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=4298.474s">Correct.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=6037.057s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0Eph4NzrdME&t=6039.138s">Yes.</a> <h2><a href="../2024-06-01_ES1ix-enmPA/2024-06-01_ES1ix-enmPA.html">City Council Resident Services And Public Engagement Committee 04-23-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=0.389s">resident</a> services and public engagement committee, April 23rd, 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=7.011s">Clerk,</a> would you please call the roll?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=24.688s">Okay,</a> so. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=26.95s">First</a> paper on the agenda to 4015 resolution to discuss modernizing council communications and outreach strategy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=36.037s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=37.317s">The</a> so on the current agenda packet, um, pursuant to the motions that were <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=50.367s">I.</a> Asked Councilors if they be willing to draft or if they were willing to get on a schedule to draft a, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=66.804s">ended</a> up creating a schedule of those who had who replied if there are any proposed changes tonight that any Councilors would like to make more than willing to hear them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=82.684s">We</a> also, I also submitted a draft of the Medford City Council newsletter, which once it is approved in committee, we will be able to then circulate it around. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=100.219s">Councilor,</a> Council Vice President Collins submitted some recommendations to me after the release of the agenda, which I placed in <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=110.828s">this</a> year and this year draft of the document essentially just asking for some more consistent language as well as links to the website for some of the for some of the ordinances projects that were mentioned in the draft as well as <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=130.59s">just</a> smaller things like use of the word committee, to be clear, and use of, and the addition of dates to each of the items that were worked on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=140.332s">If</a> any councillors have recommendations or anything that they would like to add to the newsletter, I would be more than willing to hear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=150.175s">Councilor</a> Callahan.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=272.421s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=274.022s">So</a> just, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=275.783s">And</a> the other two you had mentioned, I'm writing this down. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=278.245s">We're</a> take out the second mention of leaf flower ordinance.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=290.654s">Planning</a> and permitting, page 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=293.075s">Discussion</a> on disability notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=297.205s">Oh,</a> I think, yeah, so that was removed.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=334.059s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=335.079s">Uh,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=335.78s">So</a> how an initial meeting about, okay, let me just, just kind of thinking here, um, send a paper to committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=347.463s">Let's</a> see.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=409.815s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=411.836s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=413.836s">Councilor</a> Lazzaro.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=454.043s">My</a> thoughts on that are, I mean, we would call it <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=458.527s">So</a> this first newsletter, first up, is going to be a bit odd because it is the first one, but I'm sort of trying to mention the key points that we've done since the beginning of the term. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=470.953s">Future</a> newsletters, I wouldn't really imagine, would have <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=475.595s">quite</a> as much as this they would just cover the last month but I don't I don't I also don't really think that we would need to necessarily stick to the calendar month that we're going it would like my in my perception would just be like what have we done since the last newsletter so we would be like writing it in that month but it would be for like since the last newsletter these are the things that happened yeah I mean that's that's just kind of my initial thinking I mean we could <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=503.63s">you</a> know, be strict as to only covering the events that happened in April or May and so on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=510.155s">But,</a> I mean, I also don't really see why we can't be a little bit more flexible about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=518.941s">And</a> I see a hand raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=521.102s">Is</a> that, is the iPhone Councilor Scarpelli? <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=523.884s">Councilor</a> Scarpelli.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=695.202s">So</a> a lot of this was discussed at the last resident services and public engagement committee, which you were not present at, so.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=716.079s">Yeah,</a> there's the other again that there is a standard set of city listservs that would go out to We could investigate other Potential listservs that go out to so we're talking with the senior center about theirs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=732.208s">I</a> mean the you know, the point is that we do we do need to have a product to send to different outlets if we are going to Communicate what City Council is doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=742.674s">So</a> any other questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=745.126s">Councilor</a> Lazzaro.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=869.172s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=870.573s">This</a> is a newsletter that City Council is trying to circulate through the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=877.156s">That's</a> what this is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=878.616s">Councilor,</a> sorry, Councilor Bears.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=989.369s">I</a> am prone to make
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=994.637s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1049.36s">in</a> the process of updating and vetting our zoning ordinances with the city's zoning consultant and associates, which has worked with the city of Metro previously, including on our comprehensive plan, could be linked to. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1061.329s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1108.271s">just</a> stop share for a moment so I can check my email without it being broadcast.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1147.287s">Okay,</a> and I'm seeing also additional in my email, additional recommendations from Council Vice President Collins.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1178.076s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1179.899s">Council</a> Vice President Collins.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1410.599s">So</a> I'm looking at what you just emailed me, and I just copied and pasted that into my draft document. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1416.444s">So</a> is everything you just mentioned in that email, or could you forward the recommendations to me?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1439.045s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1439.506s">Cause</a> cause yeah, I, I don't want to use like all the meeting time while everybody watches me edit. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1446.11s">So</a> I just do one, but that's a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1448.611s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1449.932s">Um,</a> but I did just like copy and paste. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1451.693s">I</a> did just copy and paste those in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1453.738s">In</a> the meantime, Councilor Callahan.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1582.935s">Yeah,</a> so I think that we don't have to have the exact draft 100% figured out, like the exact formatting 100% figured out for the first one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1592.702s">So</a> what I just like to focus on timeliness for this particular draft, just to make sure that we have something out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1601.868s">And</a> then in future ones, as we kind of get into the swing of things, we can come up with a more standardized format as we see what people like. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1609.013s">So</a> I do agree that that is, <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1612.015s">I</a> do agree that having upcoming projects in there would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1616.318s">I</a> also heard another recommendation from Council Vice President Collins, for instance, that we include the paper numbers in there just so that people can cross-reference it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1625.485s">It's</a> just that I got a lot of very last-minute input here, so researching all the paper numbers personally takes a bit of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1636.333s">Councilor</a> Lazzaro?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1858.187s">So</a> on the draft schedule, you're assigned to do the next one.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1869.571s">I</a> look forward to your draft. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1870.751s">I</a> look forward to it.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1876.013s">I</a> do want to emphasize, this is the first newsletter. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1880.534s">We</a> really don't need to overthink it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1882.955s">I</a> know I, but it's like you said, perfect can't be the enemy of of good in this case. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1889.922s">So</a> I'm hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1891.503s">So,</a> I think that there's a reasonable amount of work I could I could do on this draft prior to going to the to the regular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1898.57s">But</a> I think a good part of having it rotated and again, we did have I. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1904.856s">Send</a> an invitation for all Councilors to, uh, who wanted to volunteer to draft a newsletter for a given month and have it be edited by everyone else. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1915.689s">And</a> those who volunteer are currently on the schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1918.613s">So</a> it is a opportunity for people to kind of, like, put their own practices into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1923.319s">Councilor</a> Callahan.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=1943.387s">It</a> should be in the agenda.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2002.37s">You're</a> the only other person here that can second one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2004.712s">So</a> it's up to you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2016.022s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2018.285s">Okay,</a> so do we have any other. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2020.866s">Okay,</a> so the first off there was, there are some additional edits as you can see on the screen from Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2030.472s">So,</a> I, again, I don't want to use this entire time to just to just do that considering also we have another item on the agenda to get to. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2040.273s">Yeah,</a> yeah, yeah, so she sent me some edits earlier and this is just some different phrasing of, and I could also, you know, but yeah, yeah, this is just some different phrasing that she wanted when I incorporated her edits earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2057.038s">So</a> it's just, it's just wording issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2058.618s">Yep.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2090.342s">Okay,</a> so a link to upcoming meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2092.844s">So,</a> I think what I'm going to do is if this is motion to be approved out of this committee directly to be sent out, then I'll just incorporate these edits on my own time and then send it out in addition to the other edits, obviously, that are in the suggestions right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2117.299s">So</a> meetings is one.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2132.577s">OK,</a> so just like email for the clerk something, whatever, whatever is, you know.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2143.421s">So</a> my understanding is that the links to the upcoming meetings for Zoom, and the clerk could correct me on this, is that they're basically only generated a week beforehand, and there are technical reasons for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2153.969s">So</a> if this is a monthly newsletter, I don't know if we'd be able to put all of the links.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2254.255s">So</a> I think for the initial one, probably the best we could do is just like, here's the clerk's email if you would like to opt in. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2260.019s">Yeah,</a> OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2261.24s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2263.642s">OK,</a> cool. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2269.155s">Any</a> further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2272.237s">Any?</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2302.566s">So</a> by approving it, you'd mean send it, yeah, send it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2306.148s">With</a> the edit as amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2308.57s">What</a> is that?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2333.153s">Okay,</a> so we have a motion, two motions on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2340.615s">Clerk.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2343.616s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2343.996s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2344.717s">Wait,</a> sorry.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2368.607s">So</a> on the motion, Councilor Lazzaro, to approve the drafting schedule and approve the newsletter to be sent out, <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2377.911s">as</a> edited during this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2380.774s">All</a> those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2381.535s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2382.836s">All</a> those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2384.238s">Motion</a> passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2386.38s">On</a> the motion by Councilor Lazzaro to get feedback from DPI. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2394.128s">All</a> those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2399.212s">All</a> those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2401.153s">Motion</a> passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2403.074s">Okie</a> dokie. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2405.836s">These</a> late night meetings with three people. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2410.059s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2410.759s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2413.021s">And</a> that is that 24-073 offered by Councilors Callahan, Councilor Tseng and Councilor Lazzaro resolution to establish city council listening sessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2425.385s">Any</a> discussion on the floor regarding this one? <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2428.926s">Councilor</a> Callahan.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2517.614s">Do</a> we have a second on those?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2520.095s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2520.981s">I</a> have a motion by Councilor Calhan to form a subcommittee to establish listening sessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2531.224s">Is</a> there any discussion from Councilors?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2569.028s">Yeah,</a> there are three person. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2570.909s">There</a> are three people subcommittees with only three voting members. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2574.591s">But</a> I think any is pretty much as long as long as it's an open meeting that anybody can attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2582.214s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2583.194s">Yeah.</a>

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2694.869s">Who</a> are the, what are the five community liaisons? <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2699.271s">I</a> know that, do you know them off the top of your head?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2727.931s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2730.862s">Okay,</a> I guess the other question I had is just open meeting considerations with the listening sessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2737.188s">So</a> the listening sessions, would they be here or would they be? <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2743.213s">Yep.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ES1ix-enmPA&t=2762.454s">Okay.</a>

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=0.959s">Hello</a> everybody, this is City Councilor Matt Leming just offering another update on one of my projects that I've been working on behind the scenes. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=10.326s">It's</a> a term that I've been throwing around a bit in some of my blog updates and communications. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=16.671s">It's</a> called the Transportation Demand Management Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=21.634s">For</a> this video, I'm just going to spend a little bit of time explaining what it is, the purpose behind it, and why I think it's important for the City Council's zoning recodification that we're currently undergoing. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=34.544s">So,</a> I was at the West Medford Community Center last week, just talking to folks there and just trying to understand more of my constituents' concerns, and something that they brought up, which, you know, you very frequently hear about, is the City Council's traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=52.293s">Greater</a> Boston has too many cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=56.036s">This</a> can be dangerous sometimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=58.918s">This</a> can lead to congestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=62.92s">People</a> really don't like to wait for long periods of time when they're on the road, and they don't like to see so many cars on the road during rush hour, which is just a problem that's getting worse and worse over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=81.918s">Now,</a> one thing that they were bringing up specifically at the West Medford Community Center was traffic going through West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=88.302s">Now,</a> a lot of that is due to the fact that we have a ramp that goes right off I-93 and sort of drives traffic <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=97.828s">through</a> Medford Square and from there into West Medford, so the traffic patterns are really not that great. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=105.95s">And</a> the other issue behind that is the fact that in Greater Boston we just have too many cars on the road, period. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=113.153s">And</a> this is related to the fact that our MBTA is really not <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=121.415s">uh</a> the best um there's a youtube video there's a youtube channel that i'm a really big fan of called wendover productions which went into the problems with the boston's subway system specifically it's kind of a radial design so if you're commuting into downtown boston um it's great <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=141.432s">But</a> if you're trying to get from one part of Greater Boston, so the suburbs Outside of downtown Boston and you're trying to get from one area to another You basically have to go into downtown Boston then go out of there to the another part of Greater Boston So oftentimes people just opt to drive instead of use the subway so I'm pretty aware of the nature of a lot of these problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=167.043s">The</a> issue is that as a city councillor, there's only <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=169.725s">so</a> many levers that I really have to work with, you know, I don't really have power to <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=176.506s">reduce</a> the number of cars on the road immediately, and trying to find another, trying to redesign the interstate highway system so that we can get an alternative ramp off of I-93 is just a state and possibly federal project that would take years and years of advocacy and work on both my part and the part of our state and federal delegation. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=203.198s">So</a> those are issues which could come up in the future when there's sort of a political window for it, but for now what I'm trying to do is focus on the things that I can focus on, and that's where transportation demand management would come into play. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=223.73s">What</a> the heck is this? <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=224.891s">A</a> TDM program is something that city planners often learn about during their master's degree, so it's a bit of a policy-want kind of a thing that is a little bit tricky to sell to the public and to get them to <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=242.645s">and</a> to get everybody to understand, but basically it is a method to account for demands in traffic in any sort of new building that comes into Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=256.66s">In</a> other words, if <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=259.986s">somebody</a> wants to come into Medford to build a very large residential building that'll bring in a hundred new people, then there's going to be presumably demands on the traffic patterns going through the area that that building brings along. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=279.596s">So</a> you can imagine a hundred new people could bring in, you know, 50 new cars to the area, which will obviously just congest the roads more. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=287.368s">And</a> so a transportation demand management program is a way to get developers who are impacting traffic in this way to come up with concessions as well to offset the presumed demand that their new developments would bring onto the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=309.264s">This</a> is a program that they've implemented pretty successfully in the city of Everett and in some of our neighboring communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=318.798s">And</a> the way that it looks is if, for instance, you wanna build a casino in the area, then the people that are designing the casino and developing that, they could decide to either say, you know, this is a normal development, we're gonna go through the normal routes to do this, or they could opt to say, no, this is a transportation demand management development. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=348.565s">and</a> if it's a TDM development then they would do then they would perform a study that would anticipate how many new cars and how many new like basically just and how many new roads would be required by the new casino and if they find out that if they find out as a result of the study that this casino would you know put <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=375.875s">100</a> new cars on the road during weekend hours, then they could offset that by paying for a shuttle that would presumably be able to encourage some people to take a bus instead of going in their cars all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=397.62s">Now,</a> these sorts of concessions, these sorts of demands, they can take a number of different forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=404.92s">You</a> can measure demands on traffic and transportation in terms of the parking that a building requires. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=417.208s">You</a> can measure it in terms of the number of bike racks that a building has by it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=425.353s">You</a> can measure it <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=427.013s">in</a> terms of where its location is on the road, and therefore how much its location will affect the timing of the time it takes certain cars to get around it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=440.344s">So</a> there's a lot of different ways that new developments can impact transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=444.768s">So</a> these sort of things get complicated in the actual implementation of it, and that's why it ends up being a little bit difficult to explain to the public exactly what goes into these programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=456.716s">From</a> my perspective, I see the benefit of TDM as being 1. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=462.44s">It</a> gives developers a way to predict exactly what variances they would need in zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=472.767s">And</a> they tend to like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=475.622s">TDM</a> programs are implemented in a sort of credits and debit system. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=482.129s">So</a> in other words, if they come in and they say, okay, we know that we will have this kind of negative impact on the traffic, therefore we're going to offset that by <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=493.33s">you</a> know, offering a number of credits. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=495.51s">And</a> so maybe we're going to offer, you know, a hundred MBTA passes to all of our residents that are in our new building. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=504.232s">Or</a> maybe we're going to put X number of bike racks next to our building in order to support the bike infrastructure and thereby take the, reduce the number of cars that are on the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=513.394s">And</a> this credit and debit system is, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=518.618s">made</a> very clear from the outset. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=520.398s">So</a> by putting x number of buy cracks, you can incur one credit, which would offset a debit that is incurred by having 100 extra units in a particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=541.332s">The</a> benefit for a developer is that there's sort of like this automated way of dealing with zoning variances, which otherwise they would have to account for by going through the Zoning Board of Appeals. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=553.775s">So</a> the Zoning Board of Appeals basically means that if a developer wants to, for instance, <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=560.114s">reduce</a> parking minimums that are required by the building, which would be a debit because that would mean that those cars would need to go somewhere else. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=569.162s">They</a> would normally have to go through the Zoning Board of Appeals, which is a board that meets monthly and it can be a little bit subjective and it could really draw out the timeline that these projects take. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=581.772s">With</a> a TDM program, all of that is handled, all of those variances are handled at the staff level. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=588.137s">So</a> you end up having a very predictable system for developers that ends up shortening the timeline it takes to get variances in zoning that they require, and therefore it helps them to predict how long it's going to take for a development to get off the ground, and then saves them money, and that really incentivizes them to build in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=613.657s">I</a> met recently with a group called the Lower Mystic Transportation Management Association, which is a group of developers that supports each other and sort of allows them to collaborate on different TDM initiatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=636.206s">Now,</a> they're mostly active sort of in the <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=639.607s">Sorry,</a> backing up a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=642.45s">The</a> TMA is a method for developers to contribute and get credits in this TDM system. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=650.158s">So,</a> in other words, if you want to offset your traffic impact, one way to do that is to pay for a shuttle. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=661.488s">Paying</a> for a shuttle completely on your own tends to be very expensive, but if you have three different developers that collaborate through a TMA, then all of them could just contribute a fraction of the cost to the same shuttle and therefore offset <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=678.632s">their</a> development impact in that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=680.514s">So</a> it's sort of a system that allows collaboration in that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=684.438s">And</a> the Lower Mystic TMA has been pretty active and successful in the Everett area, so they've been able to encourage a lot of development over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=698.251s">But</a> they haven't really <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=700.73s">been</a> able to expand very successfully over to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=703.791s">And</a> that has some pretty definite consequences for Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=707.092s">So</a> they have currently an on-course shuttle, for instance, that runs mainly between Everett and Charlestown, because those are two areas that are contributing actively to the TMA. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=718.997s">But</a> Medford, even though it sort of contains the most land area of the Lower Mystic, <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=730.103s">TMA</a> jurisdiction, it really doesn't get any shuttles coming regularly into our area because we don't have a lot of developers that are sort of actively contributing to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=743.949s">So</a> what is actually required to get a TDM into Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=749.932s">And</a> this is what I'm currently dealing with right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=753.653s">From</a> a city council perspective, they're sort of like the high level <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=758.399s">encoding</a> of the, they're sort of like the high-level writing of the TDM into our ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=763.804s">And</a> this is what would require these automated zoning variances that TDMs typically allow. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=771.13s">And</a> so that's what I'm working on right now as part of our zoning recodification plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=774.653s">We</a> had a planning and permitting committee last week where we're just sort of going over some of the parts of the, some of the zoning recodification <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=785.833s">projects</a> that would happen over the next year, year and a half, and TDM was one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=793.077s">And</a> so just writing, writing it explicitly into the ordinances that TDM is a method for, is a legitimate method for zoning variances by which we could get around the Zoning Board of Appeals for those applicable projects is what is necessary at the City Council level. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=812.789s">Concurrently,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=814.387s">The</a> details of our specific credits or debit system, what this actually looks like in practice, most of that is implemented at the staff level. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=823.775s">So</a> it would be sort of a project between Medford's Transportation Department and our Office of Planning, Development, and Sustainability to conduct a study <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=836.326s">that</a> would sort of get into what specific credits and debits would be most beneficial for the city of Medford, as well as sort of getting into the practice of encouraging developers to join the Lower Mystic Valley TMA. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=855.716s">So</a> that's kind of where we're at right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=860.139s">I</a> think the practical issue that I'm kind of running into this is that <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=864.561s">These</a> studies tend to be pretty cost-heavy, they tend to incur a lot of staff time, and Medford has a very low number of staff compared to other cities as it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=877.347s">So</a> I'm currently trying to encourage the staff of PDS, for instance, to do some nexus and linkage fee studies, which will be very beneficial for bringing in revenue in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=894.158s">but</a> it also is costing a lot of staff time and a lot of money to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=899.225s">So</a> part of what I'm doing is touching base with the lower Mystic Valley TMA, <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=911.263s">Trying</a> to sell this idea to the public Explained explain it to explain to staff how this program has benefited our neighboring communities And why I think it's applicable applicable as well and would bring similar benefits to developers in Medford while also balancing that with the realities of being a city that has relatively low <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=937.351s">staff</a> to implement these projects because we have pretty low revenue per capita compared to a lot of these neighboring municipalities that are able to support these programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=951.056s">So</a> this is just one project that we're <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=955.398s">getting</a> into and that we will be pursuing over the complete zoning recodification process that City Council is pursuing over the next year to year and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=969.729s">There</a> will be plenty of planning and permitting committee meetings about it that are all open to the public, plenty of room for public input, public feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=981.383s">and</a> plenty of room to allow other folks to offer their ideas, to get input from residents, staff, developers, other interested parties. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=997.01s">And</a> yeah, no, that's about all I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=1003.154s">For</a> this update. <a href="https://youtu.be/xAAMVdU5sYY&t=1004.115s">I</a> hope that this helped to explain the one of this like very wonky sort of programs and Have a great two weeks Later bye<h2><a href="../2024-06-01_ZuNkVVK6Cjg/2024-06-01_ZuNkVVK6Cjg.html">City Council Committee of the Whole 04-17-24</a></h2>

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=1929.207s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=1930.708s">My</a> initial question was related to the inclusionary zoning and whether it could be lumped in with the nexus study for the linkage fees, but I believe that Alicia just answered that. <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=1945.035s">My</a> other question was related to the TDM study, which is more of a hypothetical at this point because I don't think any <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=1955.78s">any</a> like solid movement has been made on staff to get that through. <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=1959.341s">But</a> does that necessarily, does the TDM study necessarily need to be done before the ordinance itself is put in place? <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=1971.923s">Because</a> my impression is that just from reading over the TDM ordinances and other municipalities, as well as the staff level implementation of the program, that the ordinances not <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=1984.446s">quite</a> as heavily dependent on the contents of the study itself as the as inclusionary zoning might be.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2082.885s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2084.565s">With</a> TDM, my impression, and I should say that I'm perfectly aware that I've been asking your office to do a lot of different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2096.97s">I</a> was talking to Todd about TDM as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2104.013s">My</a> impression with the ordinance is that it's needed to specifically allow exceptions zoning variances without going through the ZBA and that's something because TDM does allow applicable projects to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2121.905s">It's</a> just that. <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2123.526s">In</a> order to sort of get past the ZBA, you would need it to say so in the ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2127.987s">But</a> the lower level staff implementation of this is actually where you start getting into the point system trade-off that's really the meat of any TDM program. <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2140.05s">And</a> I will also say that I have spoken, we are talking with <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2146.391s">the</a> lower Mystic Transportation Management Association. <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2151.235s">They</a> are very interested in expanding to Medford, but they also have been aware since previous efforts in this have flopped that the ordinance part of the TDM program is very important to making it work in a particular area.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=2201.22s">I</a> can also say that I added most people to this, to the draft ordinance, if you're interested in looking over it.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=3708.982s">Yep,</a> so I would like to motion to have the committee chair send around the request for input from members of the council on any policy items combined with a request to get an update from the Department of Planning, Development and Sustainability by the end of June on the status of funding and procurement for these studies discussed, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=3732.588s">There</a> was a previous motion that was passed that essentially asked for an update from them by May for the linkage fee study. <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=3742.772s">So</a> just wanted to point that out for the second one.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=3749.835s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=3750.956s">And</a> I will amend that to May. <a href="https://youtu.be/LzzLsOJuQBA&t=3758.089s">Although</a> if Alicia doesn't think that that's feasible, I'm perfectly willing to hear feedback on that from her.

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=48.978s">My</a> favorite place to eat is, I'd say, Oasis Cafe. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=54.383s">I</a> have a cup of coffee of theirs right now, and I also like to get the pollen de chuva, which is the little doughnuts that they sell there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=64.572s">I</a> typically will just go there and read a magazine every morning.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=101.034s">Sure,</a> I can get into some of the nuts and bolts of that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=106.439s">So</a> basically, the real estate transfer fee is a proposed policy by which any time <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=117.21s">property</a> above a certain price threshold or with certain exemptions is bought and sold within the city, between 0.5 and 2% of that would go into the Affordable Housing Trust. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=133.99s">Now,</a> this is a proposal that has been proposed in 18 other communities. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=143.436s">Cities,</a> by default, do not have the option to implement the real estate transfer fee on their own. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=148.939s">They</a> need to petition the state for that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=151.021s">So</a> they've requested that the state give them the option to craft a real estate transfer fee policy, and Medford <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=161.647s">recently</a> introduced a resolution by which we're going to develop our own Home Rule petition, and if it is successful and if we can agree on one, we will then pass that along to our state delegation and hope that it passes the State House. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=181.146s">Concurrently,</a> there's also a few other things happening with this. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=185.71s">So,</a> Governor Mara Healey is working with the State House as well to craft the Affordable Homes Act, and she is pushing to have a real estate transfer fee option by default in there, by which <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=201.043s">If</a> it is included in the AHA, then municipalities within the state would get the option to implement their own real estate transfer fee by default. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=212.126s">And</a> so in that situation, presumably all the home rule petitions would be rejected and everybody would just get the option to craft the transfer fee on their own. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=221.448s">This</a> is pretty pertinent because we've seen in different cities in Massachusetts and across the country and the world that <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=231.07s">Real</a> estate speculation has really taken off. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=237.372s">The</a> housing market's broken, supply is constrained, and it takes a lot of money to fund the development of affordable housing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=246.176s">A</a> recent analysis by the Boston Globe's Spotlight team found that in greater Boston, it takes between $500,000 and $600,000 to make <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=258.5s">to</a> develop one unit of housing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=261.102s">The</a> reasons for that are very complicated, just it's reflective of the state of the economy, the shortage of labor, but we're at a point right now where there's historically been very little investment in this area and we need to come up with every revenue stream that we can to show that we're serious about addressing this problem. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=284.922s">So</a> that is an explanation of the nuts and bolts of it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=289.685s">Depending</a> on the municipality, there tends to be a lot of exemptions to these things. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=294.529s">So</a> the debates around this are typically, you know, what are the thresholds above which the real estate transfer fee would apply? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=304.596s">So</a> typically municipalities will say, you don't, they might say, you know, this only applies to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=314.003s">Residences</a> above a million dollars, or others have proposed to have an owner-occupied exclusion, exclusions for vulnerable seniors, so on and so forth. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=325.568s">Cambridge</a> proposed one that has exclusions for first-time homebuyers. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=329.19s">So</a> it does tend to be crafted so that it doesn't target the average homeowner. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=334.072s">It's</a> really targeted more towards high-end real estate and speculation. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=340.195s">So</a> that is the sort of nuts and bolts, what we're seeing in City Hall at the moment. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=349.222s">And</a> yeah.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=359.029s">So</a> typically, yeah. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=360.47s">It's</a> typically split between the buyer and the seller in most proposals. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=368.135s">A</a> lot of proposals are structured as having a 2% fee. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=371.997s">I've</a> never seen a proposal that has more than 2%. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=375.339s">And</a> it's split. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=376.54s">And</a> the way it's structured is 1% is paid by the buyer, 1% is paid by the seller. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=383.244s">If</a> there is an exclusion for vulnerable seniors, for instance, then in that case, the vulnerable senior selling the house wouldn't pay their 1%, but the buyer would still pay their 1%. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=395.991s">And</a> again, these are all just proposals, what I've seen in other, what I've seen other municipalities say.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=614.964s">We,</a> at the March 12th meeting, we had a resolution to discuss the formation of the homeroom petition, and the resolution was about, was four lines long. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=628.973s">We</a> debated it, we heard public comment, the meeting lasted until 1am, and we ended up voting to refer it to the Planning and Permitting Committee. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=639.841s">What</a> would then happen is at a planning and permitting committee meeting, one of us would introduce a draft of what the home rule petition would look like. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=651.633s">It</a> would then be debated by different members in the planning and permitting committee and then <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=656.795s">Presumably,</a> if we end up agreeing on it, it would then be referred out of committee to another regular session where it would then be voted on, then signed off by the mayor and handed to the state delegation. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=675.344s">That's</a> the full process. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=677.325s">We're</a> at step one. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=679.235s">It</a> was originally introduced at the February 20th meeting, but it was tabled at that meeting. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=684.14s">So,</a> you know, there was a bit of a delay prior to it actually being heard for the first time in regular session at all on March 12th.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=721.568s">So</a> affordable housing is a, it's a legal term. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=725.189s">Uh,</a> it's actually defined under Massachusetts general law. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=728.71s">It</a> refers to, it refers at the, uh, at minimum to housing that people that is only occupied by people whose household income is at 80% of area median income. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=741.673s">So</a> in Medford, that would be, I think between 80 and $90,000. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=745.514s">Um,</a> and there's, there's other standards for it too. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=749.615s">So</a> there's a standard that I've heard, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=752.896s">that</a> I've heard referred to as a deeply affordable housing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=755.318s">And</a> that's where it's for very low income people who put no more than 30% of their income towards rent and the rest is subsidized. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=767.847s">And</a> so that's where you start getting into like section eight housing, for instance. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=771.41s">So</a> when we say affordable housing, it's actually referring to a very specific legal term. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=778.074s">Now,</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=778.955s">My</a> colleague, Council Vice President Collins, and the previous City Council only implemented something called an affordable housing trust last year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=790.386s">Now</a> this trust is basically it's a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=795.37s">pool</a> of, it's a pool of money that is used for affordable housing needs. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=800.274s">And</a> this could be development, it could be helping to, you know, if you're trying, if like for instance somebody wants to sell an apartment complex or a house, it's, you could potentially encourage them to sell it to an affordable housing non-profit with some money from the trust. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=818.488s">uh</a> if that's that's a perfectly legitimate way of using it uh or you could use it for i mean pretty much anything that would help affordable housing needs in the city but the point is medford is really kind of uh behind the ball uh behind the curve on this one you know there have been other other communities implemented affordable housing trusts <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=841.11s">30,</a> 40 years ago, and this whole time, these trusts have been collecting money to supplement affordable housing efforts, and Medford really needs to come up with the infrastructure to fund our own.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1073.574s">Yeah,</a> and just to get a little bit more into the nitty gritty numbers behind the chapter be chapter 40 be a 10% requirement so the as of 2020 Medford's housing production plan said that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1090.64s">we</a> are about 671 units short of that 10% requirement. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1096.623s">Now</a> that's, I think, that's partially going to be mitigated by the Watling Court development. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1100.644s">That's</a> partially going to be mitigated by some of the 40B developments on on Fellsway in the future. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1107.808s">But</a> the point is that that 10% is very much a, is still very much a minimum and we're not even at that even if those, even if those do come through. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1120.793s">The</a> housing market is a little bit unique because in terms of just economics because the supply and like normally these things are kind of mitigated by supply and demand. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1137.641s">The</a> problem with <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1139.382s">real</a> estate, especially in places like greater Boston, is that the supply is oftentimes artificially constrained, be it sometimes that's by zoning laws, sometimes that's just by cost, and oftentimes it's just by the cold hard reality that you can't make more land. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1161.017s">And</a> so what's sort of been happening in <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1164.859s">recent</a> years is that a lot of people, like a lot of people, sort of private equity have been investing in real estate almost as like a gold bar. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1178.008s">So</a> just basically a storage of wealth. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1180.63s">And</a> in <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1181.63s">really</a> high-end areas like New York, London, this has led to a lot of vacant units. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1191.375s">I</a> don't think that that's really quite as direct a problem in Medford, but because of our proximity to some of these areas where there is very high-end real estate, it tends to raise the price. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1207.422s">Basically,</a> what that means is that <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1209.711s">It</a> is very much a priority for us to do something about the supply issue and try to come up with as many means as we can to raise the supply so that, you know, it's not just biotech workers, lawyers, white collar workers who can afford to live here. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1230.704s">It's</a> service workers, teachers, the people who repair our roads, who fix our infrastructure, who are able to afford to live here, and just make sure that they have a place here and they're not going to be priced out in the long term.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1397.953s">And</a> another thing that I do want to emphasize about this proposal is that the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1406.164s">The</a> real estate transfer fee proposal whatever form it does take it is one tool that city that city councils and other forms of local government have to address the housing crisis and. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1420.905s">The</a> housing crisis is a very complicated issue. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1425.63s">It's</a> affected by everything from zoning ordinances, which City Council is working to completely redo this term, to the local labor shortage. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1437.484s">There's</a> just fewer people going into construction these days. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1440.247s">That</a> is a reality. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1441.488s">to</a> the price of copper overseas, which is something that, of course, we have very little impact on. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1449.971s">And</a> this is just one single potential revenue stream to put into the Affordable Housing Trust. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1460.434s">There's</a> a lot of other things that we're doing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1465.156s">One</a> thing that came up, for instance, was this idea of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1468.657s">infill</a> zoning which would allow us to put units that are smaller than normal in between pre-existing buildings even if they're not necessarily within zoning regulations. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1485.484s">One</a> thing that we discussed this past week in City Council is updating Medford's linkage fee ordinance to add affordable housing to that so that developers <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1497.709s">that</a> are building in Medford would have to pay a certain amount into the Affordable Housing Trust. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1505.417s">One</a> thing that's also come up quite a bit is the Community Preservation Act, which is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1512.178s">One</a> of the very, very few existing sources of funding for affordable housing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1517.722s">This</a> is a fee that's paid by residents of Medford to go towards affordable housing, open space, and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1528.23s">and</a> recreation and historic preservation projects. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1531.751s">About</a> 2.4 million dollars over a three-year period of CPA funds are being used for the Walkling Court redevelopments and so that's pretty much <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1545.195s">the</a> only source of money that I know that Medford has put towards these developments. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1551.918s">And</a> that's still only about 2% of the full cost of the Waukland Court developments overall. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1559.342s">The</a> rest is coming from state and federal grants, which should give you an idea of just how pricey these things are. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1568.646s">So</a> the point of me saying that is that <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1572.608s">You</a> know, the real estate transfer fee, it does tend to get a lot of attention, but it's just one potential tool in the toolbox of that city council has some impact over which can potentially address the housing crisis.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1702.246s">Yeah,</a> and the other corollary to that too, and this is why I got into the Walkland Court funding example, is that a lot of funding and a lot of help for affordable housing does come from outside sources. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1718.215s">So</a> like I said, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1720.128s">Of</a> the, you know, hundred million plus price tag on the walkley court redevelopments only 2% of that came from Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1727.532s">Well,</a> that not the other 98% would have never come to Medford if we had not ourselves put forth a 2% and this is a way of saying that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1736.917s">the</a> state and federal government are more serious about dedicating resources to a community if they know that that community is itself serious about addressing this problem. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1745.443s">So,</a> you know, if we end up going through a zoning recodification, we come up with multiple revenue streams for the affordable housing trust, we show that we're serious about building, then suddenly, you know, HUD, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1759.977s">state</a> government will say, okay, Medford is really serious about actually trying to address this housing crisis. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1767.122s">We</a> can see that they're not just putting lip service to this problem. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1771.144s">We</a> should put more grant money to them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1773.466s">So</a> this is, so, you know, these <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1778.742s">Yeah,</a> when you're looking at fixing the housing crisis, you really need to look at the bigger picture. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1783.544s">It's</a> like, this is not just potentially a few hundred thousand dollars a year going into a trust. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1791.407s">This</a> is us showing other entities that we're serious about doing this, and therefore those other entities will then be more serious about helping Medford out in the future, and thus more money will come to the community.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1846.87s">It</a> really, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1851.477s">It</a> really affects things locally here. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1854.699s">So</a> I know that Councilor, Council Vice President Collins can speak to this a little bit more, a little bit more intimately since she has done work on this previously. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1864.764s">But</a> what I can tell you is that the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1867.781s">The</a> same evening that we were going to just debate the initial resolution to introduce a discussion of the real estate transfer fee home rule petition, that same day I received a letter that was signed by 21 tenants from 208 Main Street and Brooks Park Apartments who had been told <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1892.133s">that</a> they need to be, that they had to leave their homes by the next month because their properties had been acquired by a real estate, a realty group, Charles Gate Property, Charles Gate Realty, which had, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1913.311s">basically</a> acquired their apartments, wanted to renovate them, flip them, and then told them that they had to leave. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1920.834s">They</a> didn't show any plans to actually let them return at the same rents. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1927.036s">And</a> this is something that could have been <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=1936.459s">Fix</a> and addressed earlier if Medford had put more resources to affordable housing 10 years ago, but we've frankly we've never been serious about it.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=2522.994s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=2523.394s">Yeah,</a> and it's <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=2526.552s">It's</a> very important for residents who are interested in these things to keep themselves in the loop, to let your representatives know, not just if you don't support things, but if you do support things as well. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=2543.461s">I</a> think that people are more incentivized to come to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=2549.824s">City</a> to council meetings to oppose certain things. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=2555.367s">And</a> it's very useful to have people that <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=2560.616s">You</a> know, just that come along and make their voices heard if they are in support of a given initiatives. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=2568.939s">It's</a> also just very important To have to make sure that you yourself are informed about the issues. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=2577.682s">I</a> know that there's a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=2579.943s">bit</a> of a, there's a lack of local news coverage within a lot of these municipalities that kind of like prevents that for a lot of people. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=2590.629s">But</a> we are trying to increase transparency and make it so that people do have some resources to figure out what City Council is up to. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=2602.956s">We've</a> updated the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=2605.598s">agenda</a> and city council page to make those more accessible. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=2609.501s">I'm</a> chair of the resident services and public engagement committee which is working on a monthly newsletter that we're going to start publicizing next month. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=2619.468s">I</a> personally have a website newsletter and a blog that I maintain on them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=2625.393s">MattLeming.com</a> just to offer my own very editorialized opinions on kind of what's happening, what City Council's working on, and just the bigger picture behind these things. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=2639.464s">A</a> lot of this, a lot of the things, the tools that City Council <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=2645.832s">can</a> use to address the housing crisis is enactable at the local level, like zoning recodification. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=2653.675s">But</a> as we've been talking about in this episode, a lot of it also goes back to the state level. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=2659.858s">So</a> writing your representatives and saying that you are in support of the Home Rule petition passing through the state house is also really critical for having <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=2673.398s">for</a> having a city council with all the appropriate tools at its disposal to address these issues.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=2693.696s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=2693.996s">So</a> any home rule petition that is sent can be, to be clear, in order to send it in the first place, you do need a majority vote. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=2703.242s">And</a> then the mayor also has to sign off on it in order to officially send it to the state delegation, which is the state representatives and senators that fall inside of the municipality's jurisdiction. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=2718.151s">The</a> state is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=2720.692s">free</a> to pass it or ignore it as they please. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=2724.534s">And</a> generally speaking, you do need a minimum of a majority vote, but it's more health. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=2733.939s">It</a> makes a better case to get it passed if it's unanimous or a super majority at the very least.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=2757.954s">It's</a> been a lot of fun. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=2759.655s">But</a> thank you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=2761.138s">Thank</a> you, Danielle. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=2762.018s">Thank</a> you so much for having this very important outlet for local journalism in the community. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/724N6yWtTWCRRyKf72Rfgw?t=2770.683s">And</a> I look forward to the newest season of Medford Bites.<h2><a href="../2024-06-01_X875ms8gt_4/2024-06-01_X875ms8gt_4.html">City Council 04-02-24</a></h2>

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1462.608s">Sure,</a> I just, just to be clear, I'm not a voting member of this committee, so I don't think that my, I didn't want to prioritize my comments, but while we have a pause here, I'd just like to point out that I think when we say under-resource and under-staffing, I would just like to say that it's not just about the number of staff there, just backing up the conversations that we had about the finance department. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1486.938s">This</a> is also partially an issue of software. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1489.619s">A</a> few weeks ago, I went to the, you know, there was like a had like an hour to go before a city council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1495.345s">So,</a> some of the people working the elections there decided to show me what their day to day was like, and they showed me the software that they're using to enter. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1506.537s">Voter</a> information into their computers and it was a ridiculously slow process given the resources that they had and this was something that absolutely necessarily had to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1517.688s">So</a> that's so <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1521.812s">be</a> able to invest not just in more staff members, but in an updated infrastructure that would allow the existing staff members to do their jobs more efficiently would also be very critical for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1535.343s">I</a> would also like to echo what my colleague Councilor Scarpelli was saying about the idea that the 42,000 voters that the city <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1546.372s">currently</a> has on its registered voter list is very likely not up to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1552.599s">I</a> looked at it myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1553.84s">There</a> were former roommates that I'd had that moved out of the city years ago on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1560.327s">But</a> again, I think that we should be <a href="https://youtu.be/DqskVFQ6bhM&t=1567.737s">we</a> shouldn't necessarily be blaming the elections department for not doing um uh for deprioritizing tasks that aren't uh aren't necessary for the for the next election but i do i fully agree that there are a lot of things that need to be updated in terms of data so thank you yes just on this question of inactive voters and the size of the voter registration list i just think it's important to note that one

href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=131.594s">I'm</a> just joining on zoom at the moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=133.775s">It</a> would be, uh, good to have a copy of this shared on screen if that's that's possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=141.236s">Um</a> but generally so generally speaking, the 1st 2 4056, which just brings the linkage fees, um, in compliance with the state acts. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=152.179s">It</a> has a couple of, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=154.659s">It</a> has a couple of changes that sort of range from sort of basic housekeeping stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=159.702s">For</a> instance, I believe it was 90. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=162.284s">It</a> was, hold on, just scrolling down to the exact places where I saw these. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=169.689s">It</a> was 94-10-1. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=177.753s">2.2</a> and the 94-10-3-2 and 94-10-4-2. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=184.377s">There's</a> like some very basic errors in the linkage fee ordinance where it says provide a fund for police and fire facility capital improvements through a linkage grant too. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=193.483s">And</a> then all of those all the linkage fee ordinances for police and fire and sewer <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=203.228s">All</a> of them said to donate it to the Parks and Recreational Facilities Trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=207.73s">That's</a> just a basic copy and paste error that's present in our linkage fee ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=213.712s">So</a> I offered corrections to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=217.414s">I</a> also offered corrections in, and these sections all repeat, by the way, like essentially these four language fee ordinances are basically the four language fee buckets that are specified in chapter 94-10 are all sort of copied and pasted from one another. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=234.868s">So</a> I just, there's a lot of repeating changes, but in 94-10-1-2-3-4.4, if you'll <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=251.048s">Yeah,</a> so if you just scroll down to like 9410. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=253.329s">I'm</a> sorry, just kind of like going on my own one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=261.294s">Yeah,</a> this would be the page that I'm specifically looking at looking at at the moment is page 4. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=273.254s">Yes,</a> yes, right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=274.535s">So</a> it says, so in this it says calculations of linkage fees may be based on the methodology established by previous studies that outline methods for an escalating linkage fee formula. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=283.703s">So</a> the purpose of this is to explicitly allow a mechanism to let future updates of linkage fees be tied to something like a consumer index fund because the Office of <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=298.996s">Planning</a> development and sustainability tells me that the study to actually recommend raises to these linkage fees, which we another resolution that went through the regular council meeting, ask them to conduct another 1 of those studies. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=314.454s">Those</a> are very expensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=315.635s">So</a> this is a mechanism to just sort of let them rely on 1 study. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=319.099s">and</a> then update it based on a predictable formula from year to year. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=323.402s">This</a> basically explicitly allows the Office of Community Development to explicitly update the linkage fees without having to do another expensive study every three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=333.609s">Other</a> changes to this basically take the explicit power to change linkage fees away from the Community Development Board while still letting the Community Development Board have power to <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=349.479s">to.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=350.02s">Offer</a> regulations around the linkage fees themselves and the authority to conduct public hearings while giving explicit authority to update linkage fees to the mayor and the Office of Community <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=371.699s">Um,</a> and that's the special act. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=373.92s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=374.72s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=375.12s">So,</a> to be clear, the special act that was written in 1989 has no mention whatsoever of the community of the community development board. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=383.642s">Um,</a> it only gives authority to update linkage fees to the mayor and the office of community development. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=389.904s">So</a> I tried to look, like, parse through this as carefully as I could and just tried to find language that where it said the Community Development Board has the power to update linkage fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=400.691s">And</a> I shifted that back to the Mayor and the Office of Community Development. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=404.694s">There</a> is still language in here saying that the Community Development Board gets to set certain regulations and also conduct public hearings. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=412.679s">But</a> for the most part, it's a shift of power back to staff because, again, <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=416.501s">One,</a> the Community Development Board never was given authority by the state in the first place to update linkage fees, and two, they never did it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=422.744s">And</a> that's another thing that's made more clear here is if you'll go to page, to the top of page five, <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=433.28s">Yep,</a> right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=435.683s">This</a> kind of just changes the language from no more than three years, which is a little bit unclear, to at least every three years that it requires the linkage fees to be updated. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=447.479s">Again,</a> this is exactly what it says in the States Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=449.782s">It</a> says that <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=450.703s">every</a> three years linkage fees need to be updated which the community development board which was given this authority previously never did and according to the states act they never had the authority to actually do so this just this really just tries to bring it in more in compliance but it does give the community development board the authority to give public notice and public hearing so that the linkage fees can still have public input <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=479.377s">which</a> I think is reasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=481.059s">It</a> just doesn't give them explicit authority to actually update them itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=489.345s">Let's</a> see. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=490.966s">Then</a> I believe those are all the updates that are strictly related to 24-056. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=503.416s">The</a> related to 24-057, which starts on page 11. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=512.958s">It's</a> just, it's basically, a lot of it is besides like some slight change to the language behind 94.10.5.1 around the purpose of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=523.806s">It's</a> like basically all these linkage fee sections are just copied and pasted. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=527.649s">So</a> this is really just a copy and paste section around adding a fifth linkage structure to the, sorry, adding a fifth linkage bucket to the, <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=539.237s">existing</a> linkage fee structures. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=540.698s">And</a> so this gives explicit authority for the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability to put linkage fees into the Affordable Housing Trust, which needs sources of revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=552.244s">And</a> so there's really not a whole lot to this section that's different from the previous four sections. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=558.967s">It's</a> really cookie cutter language. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=562.509s">So,</a> yeah, I think the <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=566.545s">The</a> more important thing about this is actually the implementation of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=572.809s">So,</a> once we put this language in here, and we pass it all explicitly, just let the affordable housing trust be funded by linkage fees, which again is explicitly allowed by the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=585.576s">as</a> was reviewed by KP Law, then it would be up to the Office of Planning, Development, and Sustainability, which I've been in correspondence with them about, to conduct a linkage fee study that would, one, update the normal linkage fees, two, figure out what the linkage fees ought to be for the Affordable Housing Trust, and three, come up with a reasonable formula for <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=612.34s">updating</a> these linkage fees every three years so that another study doesn't explicitly have to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=618.505s">That's</a> about all I have to present these changes, and I look forward to hearing from my colleagues as to what they think of this.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=952.298s">Well,</a> the absolute next step is, so I just noticed some very basic housekeeping stuff in this draft that I submitted, which is, and so I'd like to, so I was just going through it right now, and I noticed that I, in rewriting, in writing the affordable housing bucket 94-10.5, could you, Councilor Bears, could you scroll to page 14, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=981.561s">Where</a> am I screening it? <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=983.162s">Yeah,</a> I might have, just really quickly, I might have left some references there into 94.10.4, oh, sorry, 94.10.1, when they should be changed to 94.10.5 in the fifth one. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=992.43s">So</a> there's just a lot of repeating text here that... I see one here, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=1007.526s">So</a> 10, five, six, uh, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=1010.887s">So</a> just, uh, I guess, motion to correct the references to, uh, in 94, 10, five to 94, 10, one where appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=1025.25s">Cause</a> again, it's just some very basic drafting drafting errors. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=1031.692s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=1034.575s">I</a> think I counted. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=1036.717s">I</a> counted three. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=1038.459s">But</a> could I just motion to have them all sort of?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=1082.208s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=1085.453s">But</a> other other than that, like, again, at the ordinance level, I don't think that there's really the the only the only sort of thing that I can think of is potentially some the relate likes, whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=1102.569s">If</a> somebody has any strong opinions about the relationship between the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability and the Community Development Board, I know that I shifted around a few of the, in this draft here, a few of the powers from one to the other, again, giving the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability the explicit authority to update the linkage fees themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=1126.243s">So</a> if there are any recommendations from PDS to change those, then I would be amenable to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=1133.652s">But</a> otherwise, I think that other than that, and those are very minor, <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=1144.079s">Errors</a> that I just pointed out. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=1145.679s">I</a> can't think of a whole lot else that would really need to be done with the ordinance itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=1153.441s">Most</a> of the important steps, once this is passed, would be at the implementation phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=1157.721s">So</a> I would love to hear from PDS about this, if they have any thoughts themselves.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=1451.42s">second</a> um just my understanding of keeping in committee for what reason sorry what would it be sorry if we're going to report it favorably out um what would we report it back to regular to a regular session or would how would this be included in the zoning like what motion would be yeah so favorably not favorable we just reported that doesn't we don't really do that but we would just report it out
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=1532.353s">Councilor</a> Levee. <a href="https://youtu.be/rdoYPQwM75Q&t=1534.433s">Yeah,</a> I think, and I need you to clarify this, but I think that that would be part of the process that Council President Bears was talking about.<h2><a href="../2024-03-24_3AfRpiGISgA/2024-03-24_3AfRpiGISgA.html">On the real estate transfer fee meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=0.217s">Hello</a> everybody, City Councilor Matt Leming here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=2.898s">I'm</a> just going to provide another video update to accompany my blog post. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=7.841s">I'm</a> mainly going to be talking about the very recent March 12th meeting that we went through this past two weeks and just really getting, just kind of sharing my thoughts on some of the broader political changes in Medford, where I think we're going and just have my own feelings about some of this stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=25.629s">So</a> to provide a bit of a recap, <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=28.346s">At</a> the February 20th City Council meeting, I put forward a resolution to discuss the formulation of a real estate transfer fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=37.21s">Now,</a> this is a fee that typically has a lot of exemptions. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=42.432s">It's</a> not designed to target the average homeowner, but on certain real estate transactions, you would get to charge up to 2% of that, 1% to the buyer and seller. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=55.333s">between</a> 0.5 and 2%, which would then go into the Affordable Housing Trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=60.976s">Some</a> versions of this exclude owner-occupied properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=65.838s">Some</a> versions of this only apply to properties above a certain threshold, like a million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=71.861s">There</a> are different forms of being discussed at the state level. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=74.062s">18</a> other communities have <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=75.823s">already</a> passed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=77.365s">It's</a> only one of the ways that City Council is proposing to fund the Affordable Housing Trust, which is something that we really desperately need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=88.756s">So</a> this was originally meant to be discussed at the February 12th meeting, or sorry, the February 20th meeting, and at that meeting they sort of got overtaken because <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=100.003s">We</a> had we were dealing we ended up dealing with the mayor's proposal to remove the fire chief from civil service. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=106.055s">So</a> a lot of people actually showed up to the February 20 meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=108.85s">hoping</a> to talk about the real estate transfer fee, but we ended up spending the entire meeting hearing about the fire chief issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=117.54s">So</a> that ended up getting tabled until the March 12th meeting, and normally it wouldn't have sat for so long on the agenda, but we had an election in the meantime, and so basically there was three weeks in between <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=131.287s">meetings</a> where this very important issue which was again at the time just four lines of text just ended up sitting on the agenda for a very long period of time with no discussion and even the city councilors couldn't really say you know what it was what their own thoughts on it were discussing with their colleagues because it's meant to be discussed in city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=151.813s">And</a> so this meant that there's a lot of time for a lot of misinformation to circulate in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=157.995s">Some</a> people <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=160.11s">I</a> think a lot of people thought that we were going to, at the March 12th meeting, pass a 2% tax that would just apply straight up to any real estate transaction in Medford, which was not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=175.814s">That</a> wasn't what we were doing at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=178.275s">It</a> was a very preliminary tax to, or it was a very preliminary discussion to <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=186.155s">pursue</a> one potential avenue of funding the affordable housing trust, which, again, we really need to fund, which would only apply to certain real estate transactions and definitely not be targeted at the average homeowner. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=202.486s">And</a> so I think a lot of people showed up to that meeting kind of hearing from their neighbors that, you know, this and that was what city council is going to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=210.632s">So</a> they showed up in opposition to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=212.894s">And</a> then a lot of people showed up just <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=215.106s">you</a> know, having thought about what they're going to say for several weeks anyway, um, more or less understanding the policy and just being opposed to it regardless, which, you know, I can take, I can take opposition to policies that I propose. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=227.59s">I</a> think it's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=228.17s">I</a> just want people to have correct information when they do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=232.691s">And</a> so this all, this all is kind of coming into the, in like there's, there's a lot of sort of context that's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=238.012s">That's</a> happening around Medford as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=239.953s">So</a> earlier that day in the March 12th meeting, um, just at, <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=244.307s">at</a> 12 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=245.008s">I</a> received an email. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=247.37s">Again,</a> this is several hours before the March 12th meeting, which everybody on City Council really knows is going to be a rough night. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=255.456s">I</a> received a letter, which was signed by 21 tenants at 208 Main Street in Brooks Park Estates, where they are basically being kicked out or asked to evict their apartments because <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=271.329s">their</a> apartments had recently been purchased by a realty company. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=277.616s">And</a> the realty company, you know, wanted to flip the apartments, make them <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=283.422s">make</a> them presumably jack up the rents and just tell them, you know, leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=290.967s">The</a> realty group told us that the tenants would have the option to return to the apartments after the renovations were done, but they didn't do anything to provide local housing in the meantime. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=303.256s">They</a> just told them to leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=305.317s">And</a> they didn't provide any promises to provide those apartments at the same rents they were before. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=310.801s">And</a> I pressed them on this over email. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=313.092s">Now,</a> previously, when the previous owner was selling off Brooks Park and 208 Main Street, others had attempted to make it so that that sale would be made to an affordable housing non-profit, which didn't have as much money to give. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=328.92s">and</a> not to this realty company that it ended up going to. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=331.981s">Medford</a> would have preferred the former case but we just didn't have any money to actually put towards that because we didn't have a funded affordable housing trust at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=339.865s">Other</a> communities have had affordable housing trusts that they've been funding for decades and decades and so therefore they can <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=346.287s">pay</a> for a lot of these cool housing projects around town, like community land trusts, co-ops, and really just address minor things, not minor things, but more transactional issues like this one, where if you're gonna sell off an apartment complex, does it go to a group that's a non-profit, or does it go to a group that really just wants to make money off of it and doesn't really care about the tenants and the property? <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=373.96s">And</a> so I was going to this meeting perfectly aware that if a policy like this had been instituted 30 years before, we wouldn't have to be dealing with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=383.887s">And</a> I was also perfectly aware that this policy relied on that will future, like preventing future evictions from happening down the line would rely on this policy passing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=396.356s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=399.028s">And</a> I think this, due to the way that Medford's distributed, people aren't always kind of aware of like the full, the full picture of what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=406.651s">And</a> this is another thing that I wrote about in the blog post, because, you know, there's a lot of talk about like the new composition of this city council, you know, people saying it's, it's, it's all renters. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=416.654s">It's</a> not homeowners. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=418.714s">Um,</a> so you don't really understand what we're going through. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=420.615s">That</a> was like a lot of the rhetoric that we were hearing in the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=423.856s">Um,</a> what, and, <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=427.276s">if</a> you sort of look at the, if you sort of look at the geography of Medford, you kind of see how the, like how housing is distributed and how the representation of city council has kind of shifted this, particularly in this, particularly in this past election to, uh, people that live in just in a completely different area. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=447.685s">So</a> typically it's sort of like most city Councilors have kind of come from <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=453.403s">uh,</a> the northern part of the city, um, kind of like the North Northwest part where there's like a lot of suburbs, a lot of like kind of spread out, um, homeowners. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=462.29s">And</a> there's been maybe one person previously who's come from South Medford and one person who's come from Wellington, um, just over, just over the, just over the years, at least since 2005. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=473.539s">Now,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=477.023s">Four</a> city councilors are renters in South Medford, four out of seven, which is huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=484.194s">And</a> the one city councilor who now does live sort of in the suburb areas, <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=492.827s">she</a> runs the homeless shelter over in Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=496.128s">So</a> she's very intimately aware of some of these housing issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=499.429s">So</a> the point is that the new city council really cares about housing issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=504.011s">We're</a> really intimately aware that the affordability, that the housing market is crazy right now and affordability needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=515.634s">And</a> this <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=519.402s">The</a> real estate transfer fee issue, in my mind, it's something that's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=522.624s">It's</a> something that needs to be passed in a form that's acceptable to most of the city, because it really would benefit all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=533.593s">It's</a> also not the only avenue that we're pursuing at the moment to fund the Affordable Housing Trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=538.076s">I</a> think that some of the linkage fee proposals that I'm going to be discussing on Tuesday in committee will do a lot more in the near term to fund the Affordable Housing Trust, <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=547.901s">but</a> I'm going to pursue every possible avenue that I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=553.907s">Just</a> in general, I mean, I think if people wanted to, they could, you know, see the meeting itself, how it went. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=562.314s">It</a> was very contentious. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=564.656s">I</a> really like to, I really prefer to keep these discussions on the merits of the issues themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=572.514s">Obviously,</a> that's not what happened at a lot of the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=576.017s">I</a> think that you know, it's more of a cultural and a generational Divide that's happening at the moment I'm trying my best to bridge that however, I can obviously a lot of people from You know a lot of people don't necessarily like this policy, but it's also something that <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=599.738s">I</a> think would be beneficial to the city as a whole, because Medford's also done very little to fund affordable housing in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=608.382s">We</a> had a 15-minute recess, you know, in the middle of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=611.123s">In</a> the middle of the meeting, I ended up taking a break. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=615.404s">During</a> that, I ended up putting myself just physically inside of the crowd that <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=622.289s">I</a> would say most of whom showed up, the people who showed up in person were opposed to this, and I just tried to engage with the issues with them as best I could, you know, at the very least. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=634.017s">just</a> wanted to have correct information as well as context about other projects that City Council is working on at the moment to get this through. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=641.982s">Whatever</a> the reasons, I don't like to see people alienated or feeling alienated from City Council, and I don't like it when people are coming in with wrong information about policies that we're pushing forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=658.194s">And</a> I'm going to try to do what I can to bridge the various, very obvious political and generational divides that have happened in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=667.36s">At</a> the same time, my bottom line is that there's a lot of people in the city who are very real, who are in reality very disempowered. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=678.228s">So</a> those 21 tenants and protecting their rights to stay in their homes is the absolute bottom line for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=683.771s">I'm</a> going to be doing <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=685.05s">whatever</a> I can to fight for them and to make it so that we have the resources to deal with that in the future, make it so that Medford isn't so hamstrung in affordable housing issues that we can't take more steps to prevent <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=705.867s">other</a> groups from being evicted, because this is already happening around the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=711.148s">It's</a> not just 208 Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=713.509s">This</a> happened two years ago with Bradley Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=715.85s">If</a> you just Google forum posts, you can see large real estate <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=725.199s">management</a> companies just jacking rents up like 500 a month and effectively pushing people out of their out of their apartments and It's and those people that have to go through that Oftentimes aren't empowered oftentimes aren't knowledgeable enough about city politics to show up and make themselves heard at a City Council meeting so those are the people that a policy like this would Would really would really benefit So <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=755.453s">So</a> yeah, dealing with meetings like that, it's not the easiest thing in the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=762.782s">We're</a> perfectly aware that a lot of people don't, that a lot of people showing up. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=769.991s">Most</a> people who show up to a city council meeting don't show up to voice support for what we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=777.959s">We</a> really, really appreciate it when people do show up to support the initiatives that are being passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=784.005s">But</a> the negative motivator in these things can obviously be a lot more powerful. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=794.415s">when</a> we're dealing with those sorts of meetings, most city councilors, and I know this from conversations, end up losing sleep over it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=801.917s">Just</a> kind of being, you know, just engaging like that with the public can be a stressful thing, but it's also necessary to have conversations like these. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=819.78s">moving</a> forward, it's necessary to really listen to people when they're talking in order to try our best to help those people not feel as alienated as they are right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=842.053s">But</a> yeah, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=846.295s">There's</a> a lot more that can be said about this topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=851.152s">And</a> yeah, I hope that everybody tunes in for future city council meetings and can come along to show, to tell us what you think about not just the development of the real estate transfer fee, but also other policies that we're working on in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=875.02s">You</a> know, there's a lot of things that are happening in terms of zoning, linkage fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=880.063s">I'm</a> personally working on making development easier around the city through a transportation demand management program. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=887.867s">I've</a> been reaching out to other residents who are affected by airplane noise, which is a thing that I've really been hearing about a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=895.531s">So</a> yeah, no, I think that hopefully things will sort of calm down from here and we can have more productive conversations moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=904.22s">Yeah,</a> in any case, thank you all very much for your continued engagement and support. <a href="https://youtu.be/3AfRpiGISgA&t=910.328s">And</a> yeah, have a wonderful week.<h2><a href="../2024-06-01_pd_lLQvQtEk/2024-06-01_pd_lLQvQtEk.html">City Council 03-19-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=46.522s">I</a> found them favorable.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=52.586s">I</a> found the records in order and move to approve them.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=240.701s">Yes,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=242.222s">We</a> discussed Councilor Tseng's paper to develop a <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=247.586s">more</a> comprehensive communication strategy for City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=250.868s">In</a> particular, we decided to adopt a monthly newsletter and that motion, we passed a motion to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=261.834s">So</a> the way that that is going to <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=265.676s">work</a> is councillors will be on an alternating schedule, taking turns drafting the newsletter, after which it will be approved at the monthly Resident Services and Public Engagement meeting, and we will then meet to approve it, amend it as necessary, and then send it out to <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=288.705s">the</a> appropriate avenues as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=294.767s">Steve</a> Smearty was there, so we talked with him as well about developing this newsletter and general communication strategy. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=303.729s">Councilor</a> Lazzaro also agreed to develop some social media, to draft some social media <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=311.433s">to</a> bring to the next to the public engagement meeting next month as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=317.339s">So</a> I sent out a request to my colleagues to develop the calendar that we will then be relying on to <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=326.028s">to</a> rotate responsibilities for drafting the newsletter. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=328.87s">I</a> decided to draft the first one to provide an example of the formatting, which will then be discussed at next month's meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=335.473s">And</a> I would like to thank my colleagues who have responded thus far that they are willing and able to draft newsletters in the coming term. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=343.897s">And</a> I would also encourage those who have not found time to <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=347.964s">do</a> so to, if they're willing and able to, to do that as well.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2593.507s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2594.508s">Councilor</a> Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2594.968s">This</a> is just a question of accident, kind of wondering this, and I would like to know the answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2601.753s">I've</a> been wondering it for a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2603.114s">So</a> if a firefighter is sick, why could, is it an option to get like a doctor's note, some form of documentation? <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=2611.98s">Could</a> that be?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4719.69s">That</a> is so that's that's everything for that's that's 24 hours.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4737.035s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4737.415s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4737.776s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4739.226s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4740.367s">Council</a> President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4741.607s">So</a> this is the first of a three part series of linkage fee resolutions that I'm bringing to the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4749.411s">Basically,</a> this is a fairly simple one. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4753.152s">Linkage</a> fees are fees that developers pay to the city, um, in order so that we can benefit the police and fire department, um, parts of facilities, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4766.198s">or</a> sorry, roads and traffic facilities, parks and recreation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4769.801s">So</a> Medford has four linkage fee buckets at the moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4774.364s">These</a> were established via an act that was passed by the state in 1989 and implemented in Medford in 1990. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4782.069s">By</a> ordinance, we're required to update these fees every three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4787.813s">I</a> mean, in our ordinances, it requires the Community Development Board to do that every three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4794.837s">It's</a> just that <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4796.178s">the</a> community development board has never done that so this is this act is really just kind of asking politely for the community development board and in conjunction with the office of planning development and sustainability which used to be the office of community development to please conduct a study to update those linkage fees so that they can be um <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4821.84s">you</a> know, raised for the first time in about 34 years and potentially add a lot of new revenue to the city from developers. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4836.403s">Strictly</a> speaking, the Medford City Council under our own ordinances and the State Act does not have the authority to update the linkage fees ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4843.865s">So</a> this is really just a request to other boards and offices of the city to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4852.788s">The</a> other aspect of this is that I believe a reason that they haven't done that is because it takes the studies to actually, in order to update the linkage fees, you need to hire someone to conduct a study to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4868.038s">Those</a> studies are oftentimes pretty expensive to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4873.041s">So,</a> I can imagine, but that's a very small cost compared to what we would end up gaining in the long term by actually updating our linkage fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4881.865s">So,</a> this also requests that any new study conducted also <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4891.448s">have</a> some kind of an escalating formula so that they can be updated every three years without having a new expensive study. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4897.491s">Other</a> cities like I believe Watertown have done the same thing by connecting their linkage fees to the consumer price index. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4903.074s">I've</a> had meetings with KP Law about sort of what <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4908.517s">other</a> municipalities have done around this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4911.439s">I've</a> attached a memo regarding that in this package itself, which addresses not just this resolution, but also the other two resolutions in this package as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=4925.647s">That's</a> my presentation of the first of the three resolutions, and I would motion to pass this.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5076.498s">So,</a> I have been discussing this pretty extensively with the office of planning, development and sustainability and what folks there believe is that the reason I mean, the reason it hasn't been updated is because. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5090.439s">Medford</a> what they believe in the office and I've also passed this by KP law is that Medford has a kind of a unique linkage fee structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5099.204s">And</a> so finding a consultant who's actually who's qualified to undergo the study that's necessary in order to raise <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5107.109s">the</a> linkage fees an appropriate amount because the issue with just raising it on our own is that a developer could say they don't like that, just challenge it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5116.06s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5117.242s">So</a> that's another reason that I've also requested that the City Council make sure that we include that in <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5126.192s">That</a> in our upcoming budget money for such a study to to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5130.956s">I</a> think I think it's more to do with just capacity in the office to pursue only so many different projects at once. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5141.704s">than</a> it is anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5145.268s">And</a> this is going to be the subject of an upcoming resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5148.231s">But</a> there's also a bit of confusion, I think, about whose authority it actually is. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5152.535s">So</a> the state act says that it's the Office of Community Development, which is now the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability, and the mayor to update the linkage fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5161.365s">But</a> our ordinances include the Community Development Board, <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5164.788s">Um,</a> so they don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5166.789s">So</a> the state act that's a lot that gives us the right to have linkage in the first place never mentions any community development board in there, but it's kind of split in our ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5174.732s">But</a> that that's that that is something that will come up in the next. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5177.633s">All</a> right.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5251.193s">And</a> I would like to second Councilor Scarpelli's motion.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5262.777s">I</a> think that the, I think I originally motioned to pass it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5266.238s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5266.718s">And</a> I can't, I don't, it was seconded.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5329.685s">Yeah,</a> and from my conversations with the folks in the Office of Planning Development and Sustainability, they said that it does fund a substantial number of projects with the roads and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5342.728s">What</a> Alicia Hunt told me is that, and this is what makes her think that the linkage fees right now are too low, whenever she does talk with the developer and she presents the linkage fee to them, like how much they'll have to pay, they never give her any pushback. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5356.496s">You</a> know it's a good sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5359.557s">Good</a> sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5362.697s">So</a> she thinks that they're compared to like a lot of other cities are probably far too low and we're missing, missing a lot of potential revenue.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5414.073s">Not</a> a precise one. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5416.755s">But</a> I've heard speculation from people who have kind of done work with linkage fees in the past, and people have said it could increase three to four times just informally, like when I was talking to KP Law. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5433.966s">The</a> guy that I was talking with, he worked with linkage fees and other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5438.569s">He</a> was like, yeah, you haven't updated this since 1990. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5441.13s">You</a> go up like 10, 15 times. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5443.351s">I'm</a> not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5445.412s">So</a> it'll be some kind of an order of magnitude just considering how long it's been since we've actually updated it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5451.895s">But</a> that's what the study is for.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5771.263s">Councilor</a> Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5773.204s">Sorry,</a> just just to clarify some of the issues that were brought up between the between the title. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5778.088s">So</a> it's a bit of a weird thing because the state act specifies the office of community development, which Medford used to have until they were merged. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5788.956s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5790.597s">Uh,</a> in order to so there's a in the letter from KP law, which is also the agenda packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5795.819s">There</a> is a recommendation that we change the, like, in order to, like, truly be in compliance with the state act, we need to request that the state act be changed to specify the office of planning development and sustainability instead of the office of community development changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5812.564s">Changing</a> requesting a home repetition to change a state act is. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5816.865s">It</a> may be necessary that we have to do that to change the wording of the state act, but I'm going to try to see if we could do that at the council level and get things done a little bit more quickly.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5862.242s">There's</a> also the question of the escalating fee aspect as well, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5866.624s">So</a> if we have to amend the State Act in order to allow for that, which we may or may not have to do, but might as well submit other changes to the titles in the State Act as well.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5946.671s">Give</a> me one second. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5949.712s">It's</a> on page 13. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5950.213s">There's</a> a bit of a mix up in the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5958.716s">Page</a> 13 of 27 on our current document. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5960.237s">The</a> text of this resolution is under the 24-0471, so it's kind of like it's... Got it.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=5999.011s">Yes,</a> so this was, so, <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6001.713s">This</a> was in response to the fact that the Community Development Board has not actually never did update the linkage fees every three years since it was established in 1990. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6016.025s">I</a> noticed that the State Act specified that these recalculations need to happen at least every three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6022.791s">The</a> Medford's municipal codes states that they need to happen no more than every three years, which is kind of like a confusing wording thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6030.818s">As</a> I was looking through the linkage fee, or sorry, the other part that is a little bit strange is that the state act only specifies the mayor and the office of community development. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6044.91s">As</a> having the authority to update linkage fees, not the community development board. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6050.635s">So,</a> I think that the community development board probably should have some. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6054.638s">Role</a> to play in terms of public hearings, especially, but it seems to give authority to the community development board to actually do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6061.604s">Instead</a> of the office of community development, I couldn't really figure out specifically. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6066.708s">why</a> that was, but also just in looking over the linkage fee ordinances, there were just like a lot of other things that did need to be updated. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6072.953s">So</a> there's a, there's a typo in there because we have four different trusts. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6077.256s">They</a> all specify, like you have like a lot of texts that sort of copied and pasted four different times in chapter 9410. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6084.201s">It</a> turns out that they all specify technically that we have to put linkage fees into the parks and recreation trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6094.372s">All</a> like, so that's, it's just parks and recreation is copied and pasted four times under the, you know, police and fire, water and sewer, et cetera, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6104.557s">So,</a> which I think is just, and I noticed that when I was going over the linkage fee ordinances with the fine tooth comb. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6113.461s">So</a> there's kind of a lot that has to be updated there to really get the specifics. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6119.703s">Which</a> section is that in? <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6121.524s">that</a> I believe, it's not the one that's quoted here, but it's, I had like a Google Drive, like I had a Google Drive folder at another time that I could go to to find it.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6144.121s">One</a> moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6146.543s">It's,</a> hold on, I'm looking for,
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6170.515s">Yeah,</a> it was... I'm just looking. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6173.157s">I</a> believe it was repeated in... Okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6180.717s">Sorry,</a> I didn't expect to have to do this in real time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6183.039s">You</a> don't have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6183.78s">You</a> can come back later. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6185.221s">Point</a> is I was just going through it with a fine tooth comb. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6190.606s">I</a> think that it does need to be looked over in order to just kind of like get some of the different authorities right and get the wording right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6198.554s">So</a> I would motion that this paper be sent to the admin administration and finance committee.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6225.963s">So</a> I ran it by the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6231.848s">Alicia</a> told me that she, Alicia Hunt, Planning Director, told me that she would hand it to the head of the Community Development Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6239.574s">I</a> never heard any response from them specifically.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6373.829s">The</a> third in the three-part series of linkage resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6379.21s">This</a> one is a very straightforward one. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6382.67s">This</a> was another part of my discussion with KP Law. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6385.011s">They</a> said that <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6386.052s">based</a> on their reading of the State Act, we are able to have a fifth linkage bucket for affordable housing, which is commonly done in many other communities in order to fund affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6399.64s">We</a> just established an affordable housing trust last year, which is currently being set up. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6403.942s">So</a> this is a very <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6405.203s">straightforward</a> resolution to add a fifth linkage bucket as well to Medford's ordinances in order to add another revenue stream for the affordable housing trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6426.22s">I</a> would motion that this be sent as well to the <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6429.402s">and</a> finance committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6431.424s">I</a> would also motion to request that the, uh, study we requested the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability earlier that that study also include. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6445.014s">Um</a> uh, additional, uh, an additional study about the addition of of affordable housing to the linkage
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6560.89s">The</a> other concern there, I do respect the idea that this could potentially be taking revenue streams away from other sources. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6570.438s">But</a> if linkage fees are going to be updated for the first time in 34 years, and they could potentially be raised by an order of magnitude, I think that overall, this would be adding enough revenue not only to the affordable housing trust, but to the other four currently existing linkage buckets as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6590.113s">pulling</a> revenue away from these other sources in any case. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=6595.278s">But</a> thank you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7576.198s">I</a> just want to say that I do sympathize with a lot of the comments that were made by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7582.381s">Murphy.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7583.542s">We</a> are working on a good landlord tax credit proposal, which would incentivize landlords who willingly keep lower rents. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7595.187s">And</a> I also sympathize with a lot of the issues that this country tends to see with Section 8 housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7607.492s">The</a> state of affordable housing is not, it's not simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7613.456s">And</a> there's no one silver bullet that can be done to fix it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7618.92s">I</a> think a lot of the conversation that we do have here is, you're doing one thing, why don't you do something else? <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7628.646s">We</a> do need to do multiple things in parallel to even make a dent in this problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7635.911s">Trying</a> to do that with a few resources that we have at this level. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7641.696s">Another</a> point that was made by Mr. Castagnetti about the supply and demand problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7646.079s">Another</a> issue with that is that real estate is one issue where the supply can be uniquely constrained just because you can't make <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7658.976s">you</a> can't manufacture more land. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7660.617s">If</a> there are demand for iPhones, for instance, you just be able to make more iPhones and just create as much of them as you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7666.28s">There's</a> only a very limited supply of land and given a lot of things like zoning, different regulations, there's only so much you can build on that land, whereas <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7680.427s">Yeah,</a> so the supply is constrained, whereas demand can just keep going up and up and up. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7684.748s">And</a> that's a lot of what we're seeing these days, especially with different changes in the economy and an increasing population. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7694.01s">I</a> would also recommend looking at the Boston Globe's spotlight series on the rising costs of development of housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7702.473s">Again,</a> they said it costs between $500,000 and $600,000 to build one unit of housing in Greater Boston these days. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7708.595s">The</a> reasons are, again, not simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=7711.46s">Some</a> of it's local, some of it has to do with the state of the global economy, but this is just one small part of the many issues that people have brought up tonight.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=9555.846s">I</a> just wanted to offer my general sympathies on people trying to stay informed on city council and city government just in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=9573.473s">As</a> Councilor Tseng said, we are working on several initiatives at the moment to keep people informed a bit more of a comprehensive manner, but I think a lot of people also discover that to really. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=9586.263s">Unfortunately,</a> the state of things is that without any local news to really understand what's going on, it kind of has to become like a hobby or part of your. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=9593.528s">Social</a> life so you have to like know, you know Which subreddits which Facebook groups to go to which YouTube channels to look on to find which pieces of information and a lot and I <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=9607.467s">I</a> don't like it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=9608.967s">That's</a> kind of like the state of affairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=9610.988s">But</a> realistically, a lot of people that are super involved in the city do have a number of these different sources and people they talk to to sort of figure out how these things work. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=9622.23s">So</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=9622.43s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pd_lLQvQtEk&t=9622.51s">Great.</a> <h2><a href="../2024-06-01_wtwrOMEbog0/2024-06-01_wtwrOMEbog0.html">City Council Committee of the Whole 03-19-24</a></h2>

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1662.983s">I</a> guess just to offer my own point of view on the question, as part of my campaign website and whatnot, I maintain a blog and a newsletter myself, and that's just <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1678.089s">pretty</a> much the form where I say whatever's on my mind is directly as informal as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1682.832s">But</a> there is a distinction between that and something coming out of an official government body, in my view. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1688.314s">I</a> personally would see the newsletter as just straight up facts about what is actually being discussed in City Council, what we're doing, what we're voting on, what we have voted on. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1703.903s">And</a> I think that if <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1706.844s">if</a> we were voting on something that were coming out of my personal campaign website that there would obviously be a lot of disagreements on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1714.366s">But</a> if we're as a city council voting on something that is just supposed to be very fact based, then that's everybody can agree on, you know what we're discussing and what we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1727.208s">So</a> it's really just the goal would really just to be keeping keeping people informed of current activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1732.509s">Councilor</a> Callahan.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1762.427s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1762.807s">Yeah,</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1763.467s">A</a> motion of Councilor Callahan to have Justin Tseng read all the motions.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1828.322s">I</a> personally think newsletter is the best, the best description for that kind of thing.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1833.245s">Cause</a> well, I feel like people that are more like certain generations would understand a newsletter is like an email older generations might understand the newsletter and it's more original, like physical things. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1846.371s">It</a> could be. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1847.772s">I</a> think that's pretty much the clearest word we're going to get out of this multi platform.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1863.716s">I</a> get what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1864.736s">I</a> definitely understand what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1866.618s">It's</a> just that it's one of those things where I feel like attempts to come up with another word would just make it a bit more muddled. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=1875.607s">That's</a> just me, though, personally.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2018.622s">Did</a> you get the original email? <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2019.403s">I</a> got the original.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2069.901s">I</a> think at this point... I just had a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2073.684s">This</a> could be something that Steve can answer, but in terms of getting the email list, what would... Is there any... I understand we just talked about opt-in laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2083.553s">Maybe</a> this was covered earlier on in the meeting, but where would we get the emails from? <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2088.277s">Would</a> we be like... Yeah, Councilor Callahan, the clerk.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2211.59s">Sorry,</a> I just saw that Steve had his hand raised on Zoom.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2537.268s">the</a> social media accounts would all be maintained through the clerks up as I imagine.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2637.27s">Yeah,</a> I do like just just kind of something that's on my mind while we're talking about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2642.473s">I</a> do feel like we do need to treat each social media platform as sort of an environment in itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2647.536s">So</a> there's plenty of precedent for having city council type pages on like Facebook, for instance, but I feel like. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2656.861s">reddit</a> is kind of a different environment for that sort of a thing it's where a lot of people get their information but like an official reddit posting it yeah it is definitely like the specific policy is definitely up for discussion uh councillor i thought you were first okay councillor callahan um if we really want for this to get to as many people as possible um i suspect that we need to
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2740.05s">I</a> definitely agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2740.931s">I</a> just with with each platform, I think that it would be good to have a specific strategy in mind to look at what other folks have done for that, because with what's that we would need a way to get lots of different phone numbers for that, which may not have a moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2754.88s">That</a> is pretty that could be a very intensive process. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2759.363s">But</a> I definitely hear your point about different communities and, um, what? <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2763.125s">Not</a> using these different social media platforms. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2765.126s">Councilor</a> Lazzaro.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2804.808s">Mr.</a> Smearty.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=2944.817s">I</a> feel like a survey would be kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=3036.013s">On</a> the motion, do we have a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=3038.074s">Seconded</a> by Councilor Tseng.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=3181.452s">The</a> motion of Councilor Tseng, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=3212.132s">We</a> don't have to do a roll call, by the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=3213.753s">Yeah,</a> we can just move to join and approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=3218.095s">Councilor</a> Callahan.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=3227.401s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=3229.742s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=3231.443s">On</a> the motion by Councilor Callahan to join and approve the other five motions. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=3237.646s">All</a> those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=3238.907s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=3239.727s">All</a> those opposed?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=3262.572s">That's</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=3263.353s">Sorry,</a> I literally just looked up. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=3268.647s">I</a> just wanted to move the question on the, because we, we, we motioned to join them. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=3274.952s">We</a> didn't actually vote on them.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=3278.875s">Oh,</a> nevermind.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=3289.391s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=3289.791s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=3290.452s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=3292.154s">It</a> was something. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=3294.015s">Anyway,</a> I would like to recognize my esteemed colleague, Councilor Tseng.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=3411.027s">Yeah,</a> I can work with you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=3413.609s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=3416.492s">And</a> do we have any further comment from members of the public? <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=3423.499s">Seeing</a> none, do we, Councilor Callahan?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=3427.401s">Do</a> we have a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=3429.303s">Okay,</a> on the motion by Councilor Callaghan, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro to adjourn. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=3436.171s">All</a> those in favour? <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=3437.712s">All</a> those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=3438.413s">Nay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=3438.713s">The</a> motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/4GMpYr5oF1s&t=3440.936s">Have</a> a good night.<h2><a href="../2024-06-01_XMyVKWwRIL8/2024-06-01_XMyVKWwRIL8.html">City Council 03-12-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6085.503s">Motion</a> to move the question.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6747.241s">Thank</a> you, and I'd like to thank everybody for waiting so long across two meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6751.986s">It's</a> unfortunate that we did have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6753.928s">Can</a> everybody hear me okay?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6760.409s">OK,</a> so what I'm going to talk about is what we're actually voting on tonight, why there is a housing need in Medford, Massachusetts, and how this helps that, and why this particular policy is unlikely to affect seniors, average homeowners. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6777.64s">It's</a> really more targeted at high-end real estate deals. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6782.163s">Hey,</a> excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6784.644s">Excuse</a> me. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6786.971s">Excuse</a> me.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6798.114s">So</a> at the state level, Governor Healy and many of our neighboring communities have proposed different forms of a real estate transfer fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6807.182s">This</a> is because Massachusetts is in a housing crisis right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6811.446s">Medford</a> in particular needs to build 671 more units in order to even meet a minimum 10% affordable housing requirement mandated by the state of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6820.894s">Each</a> of those units cost between $500,000 and $600,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6825.718s">to</a> fund and to build and it was only last year that we even instituted an affordable housing trust which would be able to dedicate revenue towards putting towards addressing that problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6842.193s">I</a> have right here a letter <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6844.315s">from</a> 21 residents of 208 Main Street, in which they say that they are being evicted right now because a major real estate company bought up their apartment complexes and told them they have to get up by next month if Medford had been serious about funding, any form of affordable housing 10 years ago, they, this would not be the case for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6867.332s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6869.033s">Currently</a> we have the Community Preservation Act funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6872.357s">Before</a> I was elected, I sat on the Community Preservation Act, or sorry, on the Community Preservation Committee, and we were able to dedicate maybe $800,000 a year to fund <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6887.877s">to</a> fund affordable housing developments. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6891.418s">We</a> ended up dedicating about $2.4 million to walk link or but we only pay 2% of the price tag for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6899.582s">So</a> we need more revenue streams in order to put any sort in order to build up any sort of corpus of money that can be dedicated to affordable housing residents are being priced out of the city, and we need to more actively engage that now. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6915.908s">What</a> is what is being voted on tonight? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6918.812s">What</a> is being voted on tonight? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6920.214s">Many</a> residents, I believe, came here tonight under the belief that we were voting to pass a 2% tax on all real estate transactions in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6931.608s">That</a> is most definitely not the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6934.091s">That</a> is not the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6936.975s">Because</a> what this is, is a resolution to discuss the transfer fee to develop it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6945.387s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6946.148s">And</a> there's different forms that these transfer fees can take at the state level what Governor Healy is pushing for. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6952.256s">is</a> is a transfer fee that wouldn't tax any price below $1 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6957.401s">So</a> if you sold $1 million property, you'd pay zero if you sold a $1.2 million property $4,000 split equally between the buyer and the seller. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6968.011s">That</a> is one example of a transfer fee policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6970.574s">neighboring</a> communities have submitted transfer fee policies that <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6973.797s">exclude</a> seniors transactions between family members and owner occupied residences completely. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6979.842s">So</a> in other words, under these different examples of a transfer fee policy, if you lived in a home and you were selling it to somebody else who also intended to live in that home, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6990.151s">it</a> wouldn't it would not apply to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=6992.454s">Okay,</a> this is really meant to address the situation like the one being experienced by the residents of 208 Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7000.564s">Now,</a> the trouble that we've gone through with this is the fact that <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7005.089s">This</a> was originally on the February 20 agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7008.714s">And</a> it was because there was a lot going on in that meeting it was tabled until today so that allowed three weeks for it to sit on the city council agenda, and a lot of misinformation <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7020.211s">was,</a> I believe, spread around the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7022.674s">It's</a> an unfortunate timing issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7024.776s">Something</a> this important should not be sitting on an agenda without any discussion for this long. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7029.4s">And</a> so I know what my personal ideas about what a real estate transfer-free policy should look like, but because of a meeting law, I don't know what my colleagues as of yet think. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7039.13s">We</a> haven't been able to discuss it amongst ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7042.634s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7043.315s">Now,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7048.237s">The</a> point is that even if the vote on this is successful tonight, we're not passing real estate transfer fee policy, we are passing a resolution to discuss and develop it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7058.344s">And</a> this will then contain a number of exclusions, etc, etc. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7062.947s">Now,</a> even if we were to develop one, we were to pass it, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7067.29s">It's</a> and so on. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7068.391s">This</a> is a home rule petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7069.671s">It</a> does not mean that Medford would then have a real estate transfer fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7073.494s">What</a> it means is that we would ask the state to pass it and the state may or may not choose to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7079.277s">And</a> if the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7081.819s">No,</a> listen. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7086.121s">Okay,</a> they may or may not choose to pass it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7088.763s">If</a> they do, we still don't have a real estate transfer fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7091.586s">We</a> get the option to then develop our own. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7095.169s">Now</a> 18 other communities have requested a real estate transfer fee from the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7101.494s">None</a> of them have even been debated yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7104.056s">The</a> version that Governor Healey is trying to push in the Affordable Homes Act may or may not give us the option by default. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7113.624s">So</a> that is what is happening tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7117.727s">We're</a> not discussing anything like rent control or any of the other home rule petitions that people have brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7124.331s">This</a> is a resolution to find out, do we want a real estate transfer fee? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7129.415s">What</a> exclusions would be in it? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7131.576s">Because</a> at the end of the day, Medford really needs to be serious about addressing the affordable housing situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7138.761s">People</a> come to us a lot and they talk about the roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7141.283s">They</a> talk about improving the schools and <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7143.884s">and</a> a lot of other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7145.985s">The</a> fact of the matter is that Medford increasingly is pricing out the working class, and those are the people that repair our roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7152.208s">Those</a> are people that improve our infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7154.349s">They</a> can't afford to live here anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7155.83s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7157.991s">So</a> that's what this is. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=7160.632s">Now,</a> thank you. <a

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9864.67s">I</a> mean, I wouldn't say it's impossible that the state would approve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9867.473s">But</a> even having having the home rule petitions like this come to the state house from multiple communities does really emphasize to, um, the state government that this is something that communities really need help on. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9881.105s">I</a> just like to touch on to, um, two other points because I was conversing <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9890.473s">this</a> is a particular item that I think that I think has received a lot of outsized attention compared to a lot of other things City Council is doing when it comes to affording the to funding the affordable housing to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9899.758s">We're</a> not definitely not putting all of our eggs in this basket. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9902.68s">Later</a> on in the agenda, I have three resolutions to update linkage fees, which haven't been updated since the 1990s. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9911.285s">There's</a> other things that are going through committee right now related to shortening the <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9918.809s">that</a> there is a window that developers have to sit on property, which would therefore shorten the overall development time. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9926.073s">It's</a> just that this particular resolution, I think, just due to some unfortunate, um, timing and obviously poor optics. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=9935.459s">What</a> was the three weeks in between meetings has just received, um, a lot of
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11390.134s">Any</a> answers?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11392.195s">Go</a> ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11394.056s">The</a> basis for a lot of these programs is often money. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11397.637s">So</a> Somerville has a community land trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11399.678s">It's</a> just that they've had an affordable housing trust since like the 90s. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11402.52s">So</a> it's been accumulating money for years so that they could actually do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11406.321s">I</a> hear a lot of, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11407.822s">programs</a> like that that could address the housing crisis, the basis of it is always money, which we again we literally just instituted an affordable housing trust last year and this is one of the revenue streams we're investigating for it.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=15048.978s">Go</a> to Councilor Leming then we'll go back to public participation Councilor Leming know I was just saying that we should move on to the next.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17091.541s">It</a> was just a minor point. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17093.082s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17094.583s">But</a> again, we haven't actually discussed the details of what this would look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17098.786s">I'd</a> have to go to the committee to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17100.347s">But</a> in other transfer fee proposals, transfers between family members where usually no cash is actually exchanged or it's pretty standard to exclude those from consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17114.057s">you</a> know, and if you gave a, you know, million dollar home to your child, like they're not giving you a million dollars for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17123.444s">So</a> there's no cash sort of tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17126.166s">So</a> that would, I just want to put that out there that typically in these proposals, those are exempt. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17131.95s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=17876.392s">I'm</a> glad someone reads them.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19191.614s">What</a> a, what an evening it's been. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19194.338s">So,</a> so I just would like to address some of the just sort of reiterate what I said earlier in my initial comments which is to say that the. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19209.153s">The</a> way that this got broken to the public was really not ideal, and I do wanna recognize that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19219.321s">Normally</a> something like this would be put on the agenda, discussed at a council meeting, and then a lot more public information would come out then, and then something a little bit more solid would be developed in committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19233.826s">What</a> happened was our February 20 meeting, we ended up, you know, addressing the fire for the firefighter issues and of course that just ended up pushing the whole meeting to past midnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19248.094s">So</a> this was tabled. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19250.235s">And</a> then we also had the election on March 5 so that <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19254.917s">was</a> another delay and basically just it meant that there was three weeks where again, this was on the agenda with zero details to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19266.928s">And</a> Councilors here were also a little bit hamstrung in terms of what we could promise the details would look like because again, we hadn't actually discussed it yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19274.676s">I</a> was trying to <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19278.339s">I</a> was trying to write on my website about what different RETF policies could look like, what the process was, and just generally try to clarify things there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19288.745s">But</a> again, it was difficult because I can't promise anything because the proposal itself hasn't been developed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19294.968s">I</a> do wanna, I would like to recognize that and acknowledge that the way that this was broken to the public, especially in this instance, wasn't ideal. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19306.55s">And</a> we do have a lot of improving to do in that space. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19310.271s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19746.013s">Yeah,</a> what's that piece of paper? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19747.394s">I've</a> been curious all evening.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19773.786s">I</a> gotcha.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=19923.004s">This</a> is only like the first resolution on the agenda.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=20341.628s">I</a> am so sorry.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=21132.705s">Okay,</a> so basically this is, this is sort of supposed to be three resolutions but I think it was, it was now I'm just getting emotion table until the next meeting table to the meeting on March 19 Councilor living seconded by Councilor gala.<h2><a href="../2024-06-01_LgKMjmYyikc/2024-06-01_LgKMjmYyikc.html">City Council Committee of the Whole 03-06-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=680.776s">Yes,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=681.516s">I</a> submitted a brief list of budget recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=685.802s">I</a> wanted to make it a little bit more of a focused a couple of focused items because I. <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=694.212s">You</a> know, I didn't want it to be too redundant to some of the issues and very important issues that my colleagues brought up concerning the staff concerning the budget for the schools, for instance, but these, but I just like to make sure with these relatively modest requests that we have money set aside for three studies that I believe will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=717.807s">for</a> the long term financial health of the city, a linkage study, which should be coming into, which should be brought up at the council meeting next week in order to update the linkage fees in the city, a nexus study, which will determine how much to charge the developers to put into <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=742.99s">affordable</a> housing and a transportation demand management study, which would also be carried out by the planning office in order to implement at the staff level the transportation demand management program, which is currently in the planning and permitting committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=761.554s">The</a> rest is just really repeating what was said before about the need for more and permanent election staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=772.196s">which</a> I think the last, the previous election and the fact that we've had a lot of loss in that department has really shown the importance of. <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=782.822s">A</a> permanent salary for one community social worker who has been on a sort of a revolving set of funds for a while now, it's a very important position. <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=796.969s">And</a> I had a conversation about having increased salary for the part-time library workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=805.752s">That</a> is a position that I haven't seen a whole lot of advocacy for or mention of just previously in other city conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=813.874s">So</a> I thought it would be useful to represent them in some of these budgetary priorities.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3445.424s">Yes,</a> I just like to thank the, I just like to riff off what my colleagues were saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3453.083s">The</a> problem that we're facing is not misallocations of funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3456.984s">It's</a> the fact that Medford doesn't have enough funding to begin with. <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3460.726s">We</a> have one of the lowest operating budgets for any major city of our size in the state of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3467.508s">And</a> so we are not going to get everything that we discussed and wanted to tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3475.471s">One</a> point that I would like to make is that there are a few <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3479.372s">There</a> are a few items that were discussed that I think would substantially help with growth and getting more revenues in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3486.581s">And</a> I think that it would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3491.187s">Good</a> to prioritize those those particular items. <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3495.352s">So,</a> for instance, I'm going to. <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3497.896s">I</a> think this will be more of a discussion point next week, but I'm going to strongly insist on having the money for these studies, the linkage fee study, for instance, that we could update those because that's something that in particular will help us get more revenues into the future and hopefully get us out of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3516.656s">get</a> us out of this problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3518.377s">And</a> a lot of the financial software that was discussed, I think falls into the same category. <a href="https://youtu.be/LgKMjmYyikc&t=3524.04s">So</a> when it comes to priorities, we should be looking at things that long-term will help with more revenue and more growth in the future.

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=0.211s">Hello,</a> my name is Matt Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=1.633s">I'm</a> one of your city councilors here in Medford, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=5.176s">For</a> this recap, I'm going to be talking about a couple of the housing proposals, specifically home rule petitions, that were discussed at recent city council meetings and which will be discussed in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=17.189s">I'm</a> going to discuss what these policies are, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=21.954s">Why</a> they're practically needed in Medford and why many of them at this point are state level debates Just as much as they are local. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=30.802s">So</a> to recap at the February 14th planning and permitting committee We discussed a home rule petition for rent Stabilization. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=39.27s">This</a> is was something that was put forward two years ago by councillor Collins and councillor bears which <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=50.51s">which</a> is basically asking the state for permission to implement rent stabilization, a softer form of rent control. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=55.972s">Essentially,</a> it prevents landlords from raising rents by more than 5% in a given year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=62.933s">At</a> the February 20th meeting, we were supposed to discuss a Home Rule petition for a real estate transfer fee that was tabled until March 12th, because by the time we actually got to that point on the agenda, it was midnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=79.165s">And</a> that will be coming up as a point of discussion next month. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=87.051s">Real</a> estate transfer fee, that was brought forward by myself and Council Vice President Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=93.435s">It</a> is essentially a tax for buying and selling homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=101.18s">Now,</a> there will be a lot of exemptions into this, but essentially, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=105.212s">It</a> means that if you decide to sell a home, you put 2% of that into the Affordable Housing Trust, which was only instituted in Medford last year and currently doesn't have any substantial revenue streams. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=123.875s">Real</a> estate transfer fee almost definitely will have exemptions included in it, including for vulnerable seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=132.863s">So</a> if you're a vulnerable senior and you are trying to sell your home to pay for, for instance, a nursing home, you will not have to put any money into the Affordable Housing Trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=146.897s">you</a> are giving the home to a family member, a transfer of convenience, and there's no actual cash transfer going on there, so if you're giving it to your <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=158.109s">child</a> for instance, you do not have to put money into the Affordable Housing Trust because again, if there's no cash, then you're not just gonna put $24,000 and you don't have $24,000 in your bank account, but you want to give a home that is worth $1.2 million to a family member, then you don't suddenly have to come up with that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=181.517s">And</a> it almost definitely will <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=184.097s">apply</a> to only homes above a certain price. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=187.1s">So</a> the normal threshold that is typically thrown around is homes that are above a million dollars will be subject to a real estate transfer fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=197.329s">Anything's</a> cheaper than that, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=199.932s">So</a> the <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=202.439s">Real</a> estate transfer fee is a proposed tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=209.943s">If</a> the Home Rule petition passes city council and is then signed by the mayor and passed to the state, that does not mean that Medford will get a real estate transfer fee, and the same is true <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=224.444s">for</a> any of these home rule petitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=226.906s">What</a> they mean is that the state would then give us permission potentially to implement it, our own real estate transfer fee in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=238.916s">So</a> to offer some context here, 18 other communities have put forward their own home rule petitions for real estate transfer fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=248.625s">If</a> this makes it through, Medford would be number 19. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=253.736s">Currently,</a> none of them have passed yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=257.201s">What's</a> happening at the state level is the governor and leadership in the state house are working on the Affordable Homes Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=269.989s">This</a> is a very big piece of legislation that is meant to address the housing crisis in the state of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=278.376s">One</a> piece of that legislation could be a real estate transfer fee option. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=283.42s">It</a> may not look like <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=285.041s">everything</a> that I've just talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=286.643s">Again,</a> it could be a 2% tax, it could be a 0.5% tax, it could come in a different form, but if the Affordable Homes Act does end up including that in its final form, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=303.218s">then</a> all of these Home Rule petitions would essentially be moot. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=307.099s">This</a> Home Rule petition would have a practical effect if the Affordable Homes Act didn't include the local option for a real estate transfer fee, but the state decided to just pass all of the Home Rule petitions that communities have brought forward to them in one slate. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=327.162s">My</a> personal opinion is that this practically offers our state delegation evidence that towns and communities and cities around Massachusetts really want the real estate transfer fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=341.647s">They</a> really need mechanisms to fund affordable housing in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=346.288s">If</a> you go around Medford, the absolute bare minimum that you can find for any house in the city is $600,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=352.53s">Currently,</a> we have <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=357.232s">almost</a> no money going to affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=360.493s">The</a> city council approved on February 20th the final zoning approval for the Loughlin Court redevelopment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=371.657s">That</a> is a project that cost over a hundred million dollars and only about two percent of that is being paid for by the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=382.52s">The</a> rest is state and federal grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=386.542s">The</a> city's putting forth about $2.4 million from our Community Preservation Act funding, which is a fund that also goes towards historic preservation and open space projects around the city as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=402.058s">And</a> again, we're only putting 2% towards that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=408.02s">Other</a> communities like Somerville, they're able to fund things like a community land trust, which is where the city buys a bit of property and is able to put affordable housing on that because they've had their own affordable housing trust since the 80s or 90s, I think, and they were able to just fork out millions of dollars from that to fund these affordable housing developments within the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=434.631s">Medford</a> never did anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=438.678s">What</a> would I like to see for the city, you know, bigger picture in terms of funding the Affordable Housing Trust? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=448.38s">Again,</a> we instituted the AHT, I should say the previous city council instituted the AHT in the last term, it's still being set up, we're still looking for applicants to actually sit on the board of it, and we need funding <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=465.023s">We</a> need revenue streams in order to actually build up money over time in the Affordable Housing Trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=470.567s">The</a> real estate transfer fee is one potential mechanism of doing so. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=476.551s">And</a> frankly, it's not entirely clear right now that the state will approve that, and it's not entirely clear that if they do approve it, sort of what the policy will look like in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=493.283s">Almost</a> definitely Community Preservation Act funds will go to the Affordable Housing Trust so that it can accumulate over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=502.39s">One</a> other mechanism that I am looking to implement, which I'm preparing a resolution for the March 12th meeting related to this as well, are linkage fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=513.278s">Medford</a> has linkage, which is basically money that developers have to pay whenever they build anything in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=523.678s">Right</a> now it goes towards things like water and sewage and roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=528.601s">It</a> does not go towards affordable housing at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=532.763s">This</a> is because, again, Medford didn't even have an affordable housing trust until last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=537.405s">So</a> something else I'm going to be doing is asking Medford, sorry, the Community Development Board specifically to update its linkage fees, which haven't been updated since the 1990s. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=549.871s">So</a> that's very relatively little money coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=553.884s">from</a> those and I'm going to be asking them and I'm going to be working on an ordinance which would make it so that some of those linkage fees, some of the money from developers, will also go into the Affordable Housing Trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=566.186s">So</a> that is what's going on with a lot of these Home Rule petitions right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=573.147s">My</a> personal opinion about some of the state-level debates is I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=583.565s">I</a> think that the real estate transfer fee would pass through the state before rent stabilization does. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=592.831s">And</a> it is unclear to me whether either of them will, but the scenario where the state ends up saying, okay, Medford, you can implement rent stabilization, but we're not going to prove the transfer fee is very unlikely in my mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=611.549s">What</a> I'm also looking at right now is sort of the likelihood of this real estate transfer fee being passed in the first place. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=621.077s">I'm</a> trying to talk to people that sort of know about this to keep up with it and just trying to really see what we end up being allowed to do in the first place. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=631.414s">My</a> intention behind putting out this Home Rule petition is to give the state delegation in Medford tools to show the leadership in Beacon Hill that, yes, communities really need to put more money towards affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=649.498s">And</a> that is something that Medford has completely failed to do in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=654.5s">So</a> that's where I'm coming from here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=660.94s">You</a> know, to be totally honest, that's about all I have to say about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=670.19s">I'm</a> looking forward to what people bring to the meeting on March 12th when we actually do get to discussing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=681.038s">Apologize</a> to folks that sat for a long period of time at the February 20th meeting But didn't actually get to talk about any of these homeworld petitions And it should be brought up pretty early in the meeting on March 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZL-_poc40go&t=698.556s">So</a> thank you very much Thank you for listening and have a have a wonderful week<h2><a href="../2024-06-01_2ZL6NUGzWwk/2024-06-01_2ZL6NUGzWwk.html">City Council 02-20-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2052.689s">Councilor</a> Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2054.91s">Thank</a> you, and I also ask that I'm just gonna... That's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2060.432s">I'm</a> just gonna talk, and I'm going to...
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2081.971s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2082.471s">So</a> I got messages from about 30 people opposed to this, including three or four from firefighters. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2090.114s">I</a> ended up having long conversations, you know, with two of those firefighters. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2098.558s">I</a> had dinner with another one on. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2101.679s">Friday,</a> Thursday, and I even went to the South Medford fire station and rang their doorbell and tried to start a conversation with the fellow there who obviously wasn't expecting to talk to a city councilor but the point that I'm getting at is that <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2119.712s">City</a> Council, just like the rest of, like many other people in Medford, has been in a bit of an information vacuum about the nature of what's been happening with union negotiations between the mayor and the leadership and the firefighters union. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2135.376s">And</a> so what I'm trying to say is that <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2139.737s">We</a> didn't really know too much about what was going on behind closed doors compared to the rest of the public until last Thursday when this came onto the agenda and suddenly became in the interest of both parties to put as much information about what's been happening behind closed doors for months. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2158.476s">as</a> possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2159.496s">So</a> I did talk to the I did talk to the mayor, I tried to talk to different firefighters, I tried to get past a lot of the spin. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2170.458s">A</a> lot of you know, obviously, during the union negotiations, union contract negotiations, relationships fell apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2178.88s">And</a> there's a lot of there's a lot of bad blood that's going around. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2182.981s">And</a> I heard a lot of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2185.161s">And</a> so what I'm going to say is, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2187.982s">What</a> I'm going to try to do is make my thinking about this as transparent as I possibly can, and so I'm going to say the points that appeal to me most for voting down, and then I'm going to say the points that I see in favor of this, and then I want to listen to public comment after that, and I'm not going to say anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2211.332s">The</a> point in opposition to this that meant the most to me was the morale in the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2216.797s">There</a> are promotional issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2218.639s">If</a> you bring in somebody from the outside, firefighters cannot advance in the normal routes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2223.763s">I</a> hear that loud and clear that so I received an email from a firefighter. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2231.77s">Dan</a> Craven, and I think he phrased it best. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2234.931s">He</a> said, four promotions normally happen in this scenario. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2237.932s">Firefighter,</a> Lieutenant, Captain, Deputy Chief each get promoted to fill the vacancies created by the Fire Chief's retirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2243.594s">There</a> are already established promotional lists for Deputy Chief, Captain, and Lieutenant. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2247.135s">The</a> Mayor has instead called upon your Honorable Body to remove the Chief's position from civil service law so that she can hire him outside the Medford Fire Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2254.797s">which</a> would in turn effectively nullify the normal promotions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2257.659s">I</a> take that very seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2258.88s">He</a> then goes on to talk about all of the studying that's required for these tests, why they're so difficult to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2266.485s">And</a> I've also heard about the behavior that from the mayor personally, which obviously didn't appeal to a lot of people during this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2274.39s">What</a> I'm going to say that I need, if I am going to vote against this, I absolutely need to be convinced of a few things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2282.355s">First,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2283.536s">the</a> sick time situation as my colleagues have both brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2288.638s">Now,</a> I have tried to ask as many firefighters about this as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2294.699s">I</a> have been told that they actually were sick and I'll be perfectly honest, 21 out of 23 people call in in a day and then they come in later, I don't believe it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2308.163s">I'm</a> just gonna say that I do not believe it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2313.052s">I</a> have, otherwise when I try to ask about that, I think that there's some ongoing, you know, potential litigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2321.356s">So</a> people have been advised to not talk to me about what's happening behind closed doors. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2326.279s">And</a> one in my position in this is that we absolutely cannot have, we cannot have the fire department making the five o'clock news about these issues, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2340.706s">That</a> is my bottom line. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2342.387s">I</a> understand morale issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2343.567s">I</a> understand everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2345.188s">I</a> do not want to see the Medford Fire Department with a culture that encourages these kinds of issues like sick time and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2355.671s">And</a> if <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2361.016s">If</a> an outsider can fix the culture that encouraged that, then I would vote for an outsider. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2371.346s">The</a> other thing that, the other thing, and this was a fact that was confirmed by both sides, I specifically asked this of both the fire department and of the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2381.576s">Now,</a> one issue is that the civil service <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2385.6s">test</a> is fair, it allows for promotions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2388.521s">I</a> was told about, you know, a situation in 1999, where two people took the promotional exam to go from deputy to fire chief, one of them was less popular, but scored higher, that person became fire chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2401.843s">This</a> past time, three to four people signed up to take the exam, only one of them actually took it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2410.933s">Okay,</a> so if you're telling me that it is a competitive process to be fire chief, then that is not something that given that fact that I believe now I have heard I've heard that fact has been confirmed to me by both sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2428.626s">What</a> I have heard from <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2431.488s">why</a> that was from the mayor was that folks wanted to select their friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2436.932s">What</a> I've heard that that was from the fire department is that it is a big decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2443.917s">People</a> need to talk to their families about whether or not they want to take the advancement exam and so on. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2450.302s">I</a> even talked to one of the deputy chiefs that signed up for that but did not take it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2456.766s">But</a> the point is that <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2459.503s">It</a> did not convince me that it was a competitive process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2463.909s">So</a> that being said, the morale issue is something that I do take very seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2473.818s">I</a> don't expect what I just said to appeal to everybody in this room, but my goal here is to make my thinking on this as transparent as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2480.804s">That's</a> where I'm at with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2482.145s">I've</a> tried to talk to as many firefighters as I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2484.887s">I</a> hope once all of this blows over, I can hang out with you all some more, maybe do a Q&A session, just try to make City Council a bit more accessible and transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2498.678s">But</a> that's my thinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2502.381s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=2503.642s">And</a> I look forward to listening to members of the public.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4494.062s">The</a> two things that I brought up were first off the issue of the sick time abuse that occurred in early February. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4500.545s">The</a> point that I was bringing up was that I <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4522.819s">need</a> to be convinced that whatever future leader that is hired, is appointed, does not lead the fire department to a position where they're making the five o'clock news in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4539.645s">That</a> to me is the bottom line behind, like even beyond a lot of the morale issues that have been brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4547.528s">My</a> perspective is that, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4552.045s">doing</a> this would lead to people thinking that they could never make it to the top, which obviously affects motivation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4560.568s">But</a> at the same time, if you bring an outside officer to lead a new unit, that is more effective at inducing culture change than having somebody that has spent their entire career in that particular body. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4580.956s">So</a> I have not seen anything that can convince me that the current civil service process will effectively address any sick time abuse issues that are currently happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4599.929s">That's</a> where I'm at right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4608.268s">And</a> I don't think this was another point that I brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4610.889s">It</a> wasn't necessarily a question, but it was kind of supporting that point was the fact that there was one person who actually took the exam this past time to go from deputy to higher chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4625.814s">And</a> so I don't want to speculate as to the reasons for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4629.195s">Four</a> people signed up, one person took it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4631.255s">That</a> is a fact that has been established by both sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4633.716s">But</a> to me, that is evidence against <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4637.117s">the</a> idea that the civil service position, when applied every single promotional round, would actually hire competitive leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4650.68s">Those</a> were the specific points that I brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4653.72s">Now,</a> to my colleague's point about, you know, potential litigation here, I do respect that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4662.622s">I</a> do respect that this is not something that firefighters of the union can necessarily speak directly to. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4672.849s">Again,</a> I have asked folks that I can find, and they typically have referred me to either representatives from the union or union lawyers, which that's the response that I've gotten. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4688.584s">Those</a> are my thoughts. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4690.184s">That</a> is the result of where... That's the result. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4694.986s">Basically,</a> to summarize, if an outside leader can keep the fire department from making the news with corruption allegations in the future, then I will be voting for an outside leader.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4727.029s">That's</a> a fair point. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4742.239s">So</a> I think the nature of the point of who went to the news is like, okay, so it was the mayor that presented the news release there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4753.367s">And</a> I thought about that too, like clearly the idea here is the mayor, like, there's the sick time issue that happened, the mayor brought that to the news. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4766.976s">And</a> so, this absolutely is a situation where <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4771.459s">The</a> mayor brings something to the news. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4773.621s">It</a> is public points against the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4777.544s">There's</a> totally political maneuvering here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4780.986s">Here's</a> the thing, if the fire department is gonna do that, you can't put yourselves in a position where somebody can give your actions to a local news source and it's worth reporting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ZL6NUGzWwk&t=4794.082s">Okay,</a> does that make sense?

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=661.188s">Part</a> of this is not so much to ask questions, but I previously was on the CPC, so I just felt like adding a little bit more context about the nature of the potential relationship between the CPC and the Affordable Housing Trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=675.351s">Typically,</a> affordable housing projects that come before the CPC are just <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=681.332s">you'll</a> get like a big project once every couple of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=683.734s">So</a> the Walkling Court development was, I mean, I think that that would, the final price tag for that would be over 100 million, of which the CBC is donating $800,000 this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=698.768s">And</a> the trouble with the CBC, and please correct me if any of this is inaccurate, but it's just, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=707.264s">is</a> that they have to spend a certain amount from taxes every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=712.125s">The</a> benefit of the Affordable Housing Trust in this case is that it allows money to be collected over time so that when one of those projects does come along, you could end up then putting towards a greater amount of capital towards that project. <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=726.429s">There</a> was a bit of trouble with multi-year funding towards the Walkland Court redevelopment that the CPC was running into during my time there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=733.831s">I</a> think that <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=735.851s">I</a> think that the issue that we're sort of seeing with the Affordable Housing Trust and potential revenue streams into it is volume. <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=744.495s">So</a> the CBC will be a very important feeder into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=750.398s">It</a> is, however, like I said, the walk-in core, just for an example, I believe, and again, correct me if I'm wrong, but that's something over $100 million the CBC takes in <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=763.564s">Again,</a> just ballpark here around $2 million-ish a year, of which a third of that can go to affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=771.528s">So</a> if we are going to be able to fund affordable housing developments like that, the CPC could be an important source of funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=780.133s">However,</a> it is necessary to have that coming from <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=785.193s">different</a> areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/dcCBbf5sPdI&t=786.814s">So</a> this will come up in the regular meeting, so I don't want to just sort of clarify the CBC and the Affordable Housing Trust.

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1105.629s">And</a> apologies, Chair, I just have one more question, though I don't, I'm not, I don't know, this is a Medford specific thing, so this is just like for later in the meeting of somebody else. <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1119.233s">What</a> would the candidate locations for Medford be if it were a learning center? <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1125.715s">like</a> what locations.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1910.859s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1912.0s">So</a> two questions, just about what Marianne said. <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1915.703s">So</a> with the regional funding issue, I mean, does that, sorry if I misunderstood sort of what you were saying there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1925.531s">Would</a> that imply that if warming centers were like band together and apply for like a block grant in that model, they'd be more likely to get funding? <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1933.036s">So</a> that's just like my first question, like try to understand that situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1936.859s">And</a> the second is, I mean, is it possible that Medford has less of a homeless situation than some of the surrounding communities because we just lack resources compared to those communities for the homeless? <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1953.389s">So</a> we're sort of just like, <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=1955.421s">putting</a> the problem off to our neighbors.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=2013.014s">I</a> guess I was just asking if there's a future possibility with that in mind, or if this is already a thing, like having all the warming centers and greater Boston sort of apply as a group and split the funding, or is that not a thing?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=2045.093s">I</a> remember I had a conversation with Nisha over a year ago where she was talking about some of these regional funding issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=2054.74s">But</a> it's interesting to see how it evolves over time.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=2950.052s">Sorry,</a> just a minor part. <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=2952.532s">Are</a> the requirements for a daycare and a warming center in terms of the physical space similar? <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=2957.873s">So</a> if something's eligible to be a daycare, is it basically eligible to be a potential warming center?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=2981.874s">Yeah,</a> well, I'm just asking because, I mean, potentially if, like, you know, if Alicia's office approached a church at one time and just found that they couldn't be a daycare for some reason, then potentially you could go back, you could, like, circle back to them and be like, hey, would you maybe want to be a warming center? <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3000.843s">Anyway,</a> that's just a thought popped into my head.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3356.116s">Sorry,</a> where are the communities that were using illegal, where physically were they, that were using illegal heating systems?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3371.053s">I</a> was just asking Alicia where physically the communities that were using illegal eating systems were that refused to go into shelters.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3740.792s">2nd.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=3971.902s">I</a> was just asking if we could, Chair, if we'd be able to screen share the governing agenda, if one of us has it.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4270.307s">Well,</a> it bugs me because it's not an ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4275.591s">The</a> resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4276.611s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4277.872s">But</a> I did submit that as an ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4281.835s">So</a> that is my language. <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4284.697s">I'll</a> make sure that it's updated. <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4287.059s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4287.679s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4288.14s">So</a> I just want to put that out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4291.122s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ciyF6x2BC3o&t=4823.166s">Would</a> that require knowing what the budget is?

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1946.686s">Just</a> a thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1948.306s">Councilor</a> Tseng, how fast can you <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=1952.051s">I'll</a> stop.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2201.301s">Is</a> there any answer saying is there any, any other presentation you'd like to make on this.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2240.455s">Councilor</a> Scarpelli.

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2671.774s">Councilor</a> Lazzaro.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2711.129s">I</a> have a question, actually.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2717.091s">Oh,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2718.971s">So,</a> I mean, do you think that these trainings would involve people talking at the Councilors or would involve more in-depth discussions? <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2729.874s">Because,</a> I mean, my understanding is that it's essentially an informational session. <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2734.575s">What</a> would the format look like in that sense? <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2744.828s">Councilor</a> Lazzaro.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2758.034s">Yeah,</a> I just wanted to kind of get a sense of how much interaction, just like inner discussion among the councillors there would be, or if it's more of an information sort of thing.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2864.206s">Oh,</a> sorry, I didn't see the cameras. <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2868.607s">No</a> worries. <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2869.407s">Oh,</a> I'm so sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2872.068s">The</a> little leaves in the corner were camouflaging your hand.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2938.797s">Is</a> there a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2940.297s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2941.958s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=2942.498s">Clerk,</a> please call the roll.

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=3019.779s">Do</a> I? <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=3020.88s">Okay,</a> well, it's my first meeting, everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=3024.683s">You're</a> doing great. <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=3027.405s">I'm</a> asking for your flexibility here as I try to wrap everything up in about, <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=3034.168s">about</a> eight more minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=3037.21s">Okay,</a> so is there, okay, 24-006 resolution that each council committee review the 2024 to 2025 council governing agenda as amended at the January 24th, 2024 committee of the full meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=3053.918s">Is</a> there any discussion on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=3066.172s">Councilor</a> Tseng.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=3111.882s">Councilor</a> Callahan and Clerk, I know this is a, is it possible to get the relevant part of the governing agenda up on the screen, have it handy in a digital form?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=3129.761s">Yeah,</a> go ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=3131.162s">And</a> Councilor Callahan.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=3292.125s">Okay,</a> so you mentioned the cheapest apps, the point person for the data equity and open data laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=3297.047s">I</a> mean, is it... I mean, do you think it would be appropriate to go, like, you know, do another request for sort of information about this? <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=3304.81s">I'm</a> not even sure how that would be phrased.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=3425.307s">Do</a> you think it would be good if those discussions are done one-on-one, or can we just ask Francis about that the next time?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=3464.875s">Okay,</a> that's all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=3467.296s">That's</a> everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=3468.077s">I</a> have a and we are right at 659. <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=3473.641s">Do</a> I have a motion to adjourn?

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=3659.233s">So</a> do we want to discuss the governing agenda? <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=3661.635s">I</a> feel like the governing agenda is something that we might want to take. <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=3666.759s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=3668.757s">Are</a> we still allowed to look at it in future resident services and public engagement meetings?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=3683.536s">Yeah,</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=3684.096s">I'm</a> just, I'm just not, I'm just not, I'm still like, sorry, I'm still like not, not, not a hundred percent clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=3688.38s">I</a> like what the consequences of totally, totally cool.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gDDTQFTjREc&t=3774.986s">You</a> can't say, no, I said, do we have a second?

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=0.571s">Hello,</a> this is Matt Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=2.233s">I'm</a> a city councilor in Medford, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=5.835s">I'm</a> just trying some of these YouTube recaps to offer another way to do outreach for my constituents over in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=17.144s">And</a> I'm going to try this a few times, see how it works out, see if people generally like these sort of recaps, and then see how it goes from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=25.471s">So</a> this past City Council meeting on February 6th, there is probably enough material to go through that to occupy several different videos, several different blog posts on my website. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=38.142s">But</a> what I want to cover now is the first resolution that I proposed at a Medford City Council meeting, which is the resolution to decriminalize plant medicine. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=48.623s">Now</a> this is a pretty simple resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=50.945s">It</a> basically says that entheogenic plants such as psilocybin, ayahuasca, ibogaine, mescaline-containing cacti, things like that should be decriminalized by law enforcement officials in Middlesex County and Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=70.62s">This</a> is not a strict ordinance that will outright <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=76.805s">I</a> shouldn't say, it's not a strict ordinance that will outright require them to decriminalize that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=80.966s">City</a> Council doesn't have the authority to do that, but it does officially ask them to make it the lowest priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=86.547s">So,</a> you know, don't dedicate resources to arrest people who are growing these things on their own. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=96.31s">That's</a> not the same thing for people who are attempting to sell them for financial gain, but strictly it decriminalizes just growing it on your own for your own use. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=106.103s">Now,</a> this is part of a wider thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=110.866s">It's</a> meant to support a state-level initiative, so Medford is the eighth town to pass this. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=117.03s">Somerville,</a> Cambridge, Northampton, Eastampton, Amherst, Salem, and Provincetown also passed very similar resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=124.935s">Senator</a> Jalen has a bill going through the <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=128.865s">Massachusetts</a> State Senate right now, which would outright decriminalize the use of these different entheogenic plants. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=139.07s">You</a> know, it doesn't legalize selling it for a financial gain, but it just it just decriminalizes growing it on your own. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=145.673s">And</a> so that's the bill that would outright make that legal at the state level. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=150.716s">What's</a> going on right now, and the reason that this bill is so timely, is because there is a <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=158.301s">And</a> there's an effort on the part of an organization called Baystaters, which is trying to really push Beacon Hill to pass this. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=168.069s">And</a> there is another group which is attempting to legalize these sorts of plant medicines through similar means. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=178.897s">through</a> a completely different mechanism, similar decriminalization, but legalize them through a totally different mechanism, which is by collecting signatures from individuals around the state of Massachusetts to make it into a ballot initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=195.321s">Now,</a> the difference between the two of these is that passing it through the state house would just make it so that anybody's able to grow their own versions of these plant medicines. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=204.964s">The</a> ballot initiative, <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=206.988s">would</a> make it so that people that go through a course are able to prescribe and go through therapeutic sessions with these sorts of medicines, but it wouldn't outright decriminalize them. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=225.492s">Now,</a> the reason that this is not favorable is because it's been tried before in Oregon, and the effect of having this sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=237.096s">convoluted</a> system where only certain individuals are able to give out these kinds of medicines is that the price of these <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=247.121s">things</a> like psilocybin, psilocybin, ayahuasca, ends up skyrocketing. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=251.603s">So</a> right now in Oregon, if you want to take psilocybin or other kinds of entheogenic medicines for something like PTSD, addiction, and recent studies are showing that these are some of the most effective treatments for these, if you want to take that in the state of Oregon, it would cost you upwards of $3,500. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=275.112s">Now,</a> it doesn't take anywhere close to that to actually produce. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=279.202s">and</a> grow these things on your own. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=282.963s">But</a> because they're regulated in a certain way and because state lawmakers can't get rid of something that was passed by a ballot measure, now Oregon is kind of stuck with this system where it's regulated by an unelected commission that was put there through a direct vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=303.428s">And</a> right now a similar initiative is currently underway in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=311.47s">So</a> this resolution, I'm very glad that it passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=315.712s">It</a> is a way to show support to just making it so that people can grow these things on their own without having any kind of an <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=326.42s">an</a> unelected commission or weird regulations happening around it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=330.204s">And</a> I really think that's the best way forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=333.887s">More</a> generally speaking, this is a way to advocate for more nuanced drug policy in Medford and the state of Massachusetts generally. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=344.657s">So</a> for a long time, <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=348.617s">drugs</a> have been regulated out of a sense of fear, and basically all forms of illegal drugs, from marijuana to the harder stuff like narcotics, were pretty much put into the same category. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=364.66s">I</a> think this was done due to a lack of public education, this was due to fear, this was due to a hard-on-crime kind of an attitude, but it was not <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=377.723s">done</a> out of any kind of nuanced science-backed policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=383.766s">So</a> what's really needed when enforcing different kinds of regulations on drugs these days is to have policies <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=393.9s">that</a> are based in science, that are based in very contextualized studies of the individual drugs that are being regulated. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=403.044s">We've</a> started to do that in recent years with marijuana. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=405.565s">So</a> just this past week, I went to the ribbon cutting for Theory Wellness, the Theory Wellness dispensary on Mystic Avenue in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=413.688s">And</a> this came after decades and decades of marijuana being criminalized and people being thrown in prison for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=422.827s">Now</a> this also comes on the wake of the fentanyl epidemic that America is currently going through, which went on the heels of the opioid crisis that we also went through that was caused by Purdue Pharma. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=442.165s">So,</a> I've read about these issues extensively, I've read Empire of Pain by Patrick Roddick Keefe, great book, and I've seen comments from people who say, okay, you're decriminalizing certain kinds of drugs now, is that a slippery slope? <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=458.854s">And</a> I really don't think it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=461.4s">you</a> know, these different, these other kinds of plant medicines, as they're called in the resolution, you know, ayahuasca, mescaline-containing cacti, psilocybin. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=473.369s">I</a> think that they are at a level above marijuana. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=479.053s">But</a> they are not the kinds of things that cause public health epidemics in the same way that narcotics do. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=488.182s">So</a> I don't think that they should be criminalized in exactly the same way. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=491.985s">When</a> we're dealing with different kinds of drugs, we need different kinds of policies behind them. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=497.13s">And</a> that is an important thing to keep in mind when crafting any sort of legislation. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=504.431s">More</a> generally, this past Tuesday was interesting for me because this was my first resolution of any kind that I tried to pass, and I did a couple of things wrong, which is why anybody that tuned into the meeting might have been a little bit confused by how things went. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=524.471s">This</a> is a non-binding resolution, it's more of a request to the Middlesex County District Attorney and the Chief of Police asking them to deprioritize something. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=539.329s">And</a> so when it was introduced, what happened was I gave a speech on it, I said why I think it should be passed by the city council, and then I just kind of did nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=549.701s">And</a> so then a colleague of mine who wanted feedback from the chief of police, he made a motion to send it to committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=556.187s">Now,</a> I know that this is a very timely resolution and sending it to committee could delay it for months, so I didn't really like that turn of events, but I had also made the mistake of not immediately pushing the question on it, of not immediately trying to pass making a motion to pass the resolution itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=574.898s">So</a> that was on me. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=578.859s">Initially,</a> it was sent to Committee 5-2 with me being one of the dissenting votes on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=585.562s">But</a> after, at the end of the meeting, one of my colleagues, Councilor Collins, who ended up seeing that I was not happy with how that <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=594.972s">came</a> about, who saw that this was just, you know, a first time Councilor who wasn't, you know, who, you know, didn't realize that I should have, you know, pushed forward, made a motion to pass the resolution immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=607.634s">She</a> ended up invoking something called Rule 28, which says that if you voted yes on something earlier in the meeting, you could call it back to a vote again if you want to change your vote on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=619.536s">So</a> she had voted yes on to send it to committee so that she then brought it back. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=624.348s">And</a> we ended up passing the resolution six to one with the only amendment to the resolution being that it would come with an official request for feedback from the chief of police. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=634.734s">So</a> it ended up working out. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=637.256s">It</a> was a little bit bumpy, but I was very proud that I got one resolution passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=643.899s">It</a> was for an initiative that's very complicated, but which I really, really believe in. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=650.163s">And</a> yeah, <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=654.304s">I'm</a> a new city councilor and I'm learning a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=656.566s">So</a> I hope that this video provides some insight into the background of these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=664.011s">I'd</a> really be interested to know if y'all like this kind of in-person <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=670.775s">in-person</a> recap instead of just having it written in a blog post. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=674.518s">So</a> just let me know what you think, either via personal email or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=681.263s">And</a> yeah, I'm looking forward to the committee meetings next week and the next regular meeting on the 20th. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=689.749s">So</a> have a great week, guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/JksQuBga2uU&t=692.771s">Later.</a> <h2><a href="../2024-06-01_GOUOtu3l1ks/2024-06-01_GOUOtu3l1ks.html">City Council 02-06-24</a></h2>
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=18.709s">Present.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2357.503s">Yes,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2358.764s">So</a> this is, I'd like to thank the council for considering this very long text. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2365.952s">Essentially,</a> this is just a resolution to decriminalize plant-based medicine. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2371.539s">You</a> know, these are not the same as opioids that cause a public health crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2378.426s">They</a> are non-addictive. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2379.887s">They</a> have been shown to be able to treat things like PTSD and addiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2386.01s">This</a> has already been done, as it said, by seven other Massachusetts communities, so we would be the eighth. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2391.954s">This</a> is meant to first encourage local law enforcement to deprioritize this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2400.138s">I</a> don't believe that this council has the authority to outright <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2403.08s">to</a> decriminalize it, and it is meant to support the state-level initiative to do just that, which is currently being sponsored in the Massachusetts Senate by Senator Jalen. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2415.391s">Just</a> to clarify one part of this and offer a little bit of context is in the part of the reading that was waived. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2423.799s">This</a> resolution calls that the Bedford City Council, sorry, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2428.543s">to</a> do well so okay so basically there are there's just for a little bit of context there are a couple of different ways to decriminalize this one of them and another avenue that is currently being pursued is a signature collection method which would basically create a an unelected commission that would add its own that if passed in massachusetts would add its own regulation to these plant medicines this has already been passed in <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2458.291s">Oregon,</a> and long story short, it's made the price of these plant medicines go between $1,000 and $3,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2465.316s">So</a> doing things this way through elected representatives would just help to decriminalize it and not create this sort of artificial price. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2476.683s">So</a> I think that this is a very important step forward to creating a nuanced and science-backed drug policy in the state of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2485.549s">And</a> I'd like to thank this council for considering it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2488.971s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2489.872s">Councilor</a> Callahan.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3215.626s">I</a> just want to clarify that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3218.307s">So</a> the US military is regulated federally. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3223.45s">So</a> I am personally subject to urinalysis several times a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3226.772s">So</a> I haven't personally tried these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3229.053s">But</a> in my day job, I'm also a neuroscientist. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3233.876s">So</a> I don't study plant medicine directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3237.137s">So</a> my colleagues have. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3238.618s">And</a> I've talked with experts who have also <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3244.361s">uh</a> specialize in this themselves so I would so I think that if you know if this were to go to committee for further discussion we like um I guess I guess my I guess my <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3261.142s">My</a> concern with that is that this is more of a statewide issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3269.125s">And</a> so it's really trying to support it at that level. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3275.747s">I</a> would assume that if seven other Massachusetts towns have also passed similar resolutions, then they're <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3284.15s">their</a> law enforcement is not so uniquely different from Medford that Medford has some unique public health considerations specific to this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3294.996s">So</a> I and you know, if it were all if it were referred to committee, I would also encourage us to speak not only to law enforcement, but to also, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3303.681s">public</a> health experts, people who specifically study this, people who specifically study this, and other stakeholders as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3312.826s">I</a> personally would like it to be voted on tonight, but obviously if that isn't the will of this council, then it would go to committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=3324.633s">Councilor</a> Callahan.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4336.374s">I'd</a> just like to say that many members of this community, people I consider to be very close friends have encouraged me to vote in favor of this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4345.062s">What</a> I will say is that <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4356.093s">I'm</a> an officer in the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4357.915s">military.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4358.596s">The</a> Hatch Act does technically allow reservists to comment on these sorts of matters when not on active duty. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4367.846s">It</a> is my belief, however, that even though I do commend my colleague for writing a <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4376.909s">very</a> thorough and very well said resolution that voting on this resolution would adversely impact my ability to do my job. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4388.717s">So</a> I just want to put that out there, and I will be abstaining from this. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=4398.444s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Leming.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14238.615s">Yes,</a> so is it sorry? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14243.779s">So</a> I didn't do this with my last motion is appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14245.96s">Just</a> start by motioning to refer to admin finance motion to refer to admin finance on the motion of Council.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14261.474s">So,</a> this is a so basically going going around Medford, I think it's pretty clear that we have a bit of an issue with vacant storefront properties not only storefront properties like in West Medford that have been <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14276.893s">unoccupied</a> for a year and a half, going on two years, but also storefront properties that are effective, that are just not open consistently or often. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14292.586s">This</a> was a policy proposal that I brought up door-to-door continuously when people kept talking about the fact that stores are just not occupied and generally found <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14303.696s">I</a> couldn't find a single person who actually opposed it when I was going door to door. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14308.5s">Now,</a> I'm going to be the first to say that this is a nuanced issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14315.086s">The</a> reason that people choose to create or choose to leave property unoccupied is <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14323.493s">there</a> could be a lot of different reasons for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14325.514s">And</a> so I hope that in committee we're able to craft a policy that can incentivize businesses to open up shop to, or sorry, incentivize landlords to open up shop to good businesses around town and thereby boost the revenue in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14346.465s">What</a> we would like to avoid is <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14349.406s">you</a> know, businesses just deciding to rent it out to like, you know, a random, a random pawn shop or something so that we just have those springing up left and right around town or just, you know, another another kind of business that I don't want to insult by just bringing up an example. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14366.979s">But</a> the point but the point is, like, I don't want to insult pawn shop owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14370.862s">I</a> shouldn't I shouldn't have said that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14373.223s">You</a> know, but but but yeah, I hope that my point I hope that my never going away. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14379.994s">Yeah,</a> I hope I hope that my my point is heard there. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14384.935s">But,</a> uh, you know, uh, in any case, uh, I would just I just think that this is an issue that Medford City Council really needs to, uh, really needs to address and be active about at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14399.218s">So</a> I welcome any discussion on motion.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14415.145s">I</a> apologize to any and all.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14718.134s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14718.955s">Councilor</a> Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14720.036s">Yes,</a> and I do wish my colleague were still sitting here so that I could respond to some of the points that he brought up, but he seems to have had to step out temporarily. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14730.204s">But</a> just to clarify the intent of this, I knocked on someone's door in West Medford, and this person was a business owner, owned some gyms in a couple of other areas, and she told me <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14745.377s">that</a> she was trying to open up a gym in West Medford, and she had attempted to contact the landlord several different times, and the landlord wouldn't even return her phone calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14756.248s">Okay,</a> so speculative squatting, waiting for somebody to give a good price on property, et cetera, is a strategy that landlords do. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14770.361s">this</a> now if the commercial vacancy tax were implemented successfully, it would be applied very rarely. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14775.924s">The</a> intention of something like this would be to get landlords to come to the table and work and work with the economic development director, work with different parties. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14787.49s">We</a> do need carrots. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14789.191s">We</a> also need sticks so that people so that people don't just <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14796.494s">own</a> properties and get too complacent with them, but they're incentivized in different ways to own commercial storefront property, not just for their own personal gain, but also to beautify the town. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14811.212s">So</a> the intention of this, and I hope that we can hammer out something in committee that works full <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14816.578s">that</a> we're trying to do, and I think that's what we're trying to do in both parties is to get something that just gets landlords to the table and understanding that, yes, they do need to rent out something. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14826.665s">Suitable</a> in the properties that they own. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14828.927s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14890.428s">I'd</a> just like to, not that I'm responding, but I'm addressing. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14893.629s">Yes,</a> tell me, what's the chair? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14895.13s">What</a> do you think? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14896.69s">In</a> a completely unrelated, completely unrelated. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14900.131s">What</a> do you feel? <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14901.231s">Yeah,</a> just just just totally unrelated to anything happening on this side of the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14904.792s">I</a> don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14905.752s">I</a> don't really understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14907.113s">But</a> so the intent of this is to only apply to the commercial storefront property. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14913.076s">It's</a> just a thought that came to think. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=14914.757s">I</a> mean, that's a that's a question that I had.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15661.434s">So</a> I was going to motion to refer this to the committee on planning and permitting. <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=15667.298s">Perfect.</a> 
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16808.366s">So</a> would the, wait, so to be clear, <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16812.679s">we</a> would pass it and then the police chief would come back with his recommendations.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16819.44s">Sure,</a> that's fine.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=16885.782s">Aye.</a>

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=1581.493s">I</a> was just going to comment that the city's had a couple of new hires even ever since January for a number of positions that I thought they were waiting to hear back on that compensation study before they move forward with hiring them. <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=1598.617s">I</a> mean, is it possible that some portion of it was already complete? <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=1602.058s">There</a> are just a lot of new hires for senior level positions and just across City Hall that we've been informed about. <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=1611.44s">recently,</a> so clearly some compensation, some agreement about compensation must have been reached with or without the study.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=1808.401s">Motion</a> to request an update on the classification and compensation study.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2168.308s">Yeah,</a> just it just seems like in general with a lot of a lot of the larger projects, those are those can be a little bit more difficult to pass forward in themselves without because, like, they're affected by outside factors. <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2180.354s">But</a> for some of the some of the smaller things on this that are going to be pushed ahead by. <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2187.197s">uh</a> individual Councilors so i know it was Councilor collins that proposed the good landlord tax credit the last meeting and i submitted uh for consideration at the upcoming meeting a resolution on the commercial vacancy tax um those seem like they can be pushed ahead sort of whenever uh there is time to do so at the admin and at these meetings um <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2216.89s">Barring</a> progress on some of the, uh, some of the need to do, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2224.296s">Things</a> like the annual budget process and revenue generation property to an F planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2231.522s">So,</a> I'm talking to with regards to the. <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2236.451s">Vacancy</a> tax specifically, um, I'm talking to some folks at the planning office about sort of best practices for doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2244.032s">But</a> of course, that also does need that would also need to be voted on at the next regular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2249.413s">Should,</a> uh, should it pass there?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2337.392s">Yeah,</a> just to just add a question coming from a very new Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2341.295s">So,</a> how long what would you I know that I'm seeing the timelines on this on the, uh, the actual calendar there, but. <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2351.483s">So</a> how long just taking the commercial vacancy tax, the landlord tax credit, which are two very new proposals, would you estimate it takes from going to that first resolution to somebody potentially paying that tax or receiving a tax benefit from that on the ground in real life and actually putting that into the budget?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2483.687s">With</a> the commercial vacancy tax, I don't think it would be, if it were implemented, it would specifically apply to vacant or effectively closed storefronts. <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2499.824s">the</a> number of businesses that that would apply to would be very, very small compared to the number that would be applied to the good landlord tax credit, which could be hundreds of people around town. <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2512.815s">It</a> would be much more targeted and it wouldn't be enough to significantly affect the total tax levy. <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2523.625s">It's</a> more of an incentive and not a revenue generating mechanism.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2582.803s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-d4yZHSnH_Q&t=2583.503s">So,</a> although I'm not sure how much we're able to discuss something that hasn't been referred to committee, so if there's a... just, yeah, just pointing that out.

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=749.132s">And</a> I will go to just just a question for reduced for introducing these ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=755.576s">So,</a> the commercial vacancy tax could potentially. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=760.078s">be</a> worked on in both planning and permitting committee, as noted in here, as well as admin and finance. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=765.88s">So</a> what would the process for something being developed simultaneously in two different committees look like?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2780.378s">This</a> is just specifically regarding the plant medicine decriminalization ordinance, just to state. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2787.68s">The</a> goals of that may have already been addressed by the resolution that was submitted for the next regular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2795.143s">I</a> think that <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2799.105s">There</a> is some work that needs to be done at the state level before that could be implemented as an ordinance locally. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=2807.51s">So</a> I don't necessarily want a motion to strike it now before I do a little bit more research, but it may be an update to the governing agenda in the future.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4342.066s">Um,</a> well, there's just a small point about this, but this particular section, so I do very much appreciate my, my colleague Councilor Tsengs, uh, capacity for, for work, but he is listed as the lead Councilor on 11 of the 12 projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4360.582s">And</a> so I don't have specific recommendations at this time for who should lead which project, but I. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4368.488s">I</a> am of the opinion that perhaps we should spread the work out a little bit more among the committee when designating lead councillors. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4377.693s">I'm</a> also not wholly clear how much we're really committing to the lead councillor for some of the unproposed or some of the ones that have yet to be proposed as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4389.739s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/heiIdRQDlrw&t=4390.86s">Are</a> you going to Councilor Tseng?<h2><a href="../2024-06-01_FLTVHcz7fAI/2024-06-01_FLTVHcz7fAI.html">City Council 01-23-24</a></h2>

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7490.545s">Just</a> first off, I would like to thank MTA President Gehan for bringing up the issue about the paraprofessional receiving disciplinary action. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7500.014s">I</a> know that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7501.355s">Cherry</a> also commented on it, but any information that you're free to email about that to me, I would very much appreciate just to <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7508.542s">learn</a> more about that particular situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7510.863s">This</a> is just a broader point that echoes a lot of what's been said. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7519.546s">For</a> a long time Medford's been penny smart and dollar stupid. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7527.489s">So</a> we're talking about <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7534.008s">the,</a> when we're talking about the total operating budget of Medford, it's just above about $200 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7540.21s">Somerville's</a> is between seven and 800 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7542.931s">Cambridge's</a> is about a billion. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7545.092s">If</a> you're considering the sort of per capita operating budget, so the amount of money spent per person in a municipality, Medford's is one of the lowest for a substantially sized city in the state of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7561.157s">Basically,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7563.618s">We</a> have been trying to cut costs here and there for a very long period of time, and that's the reason that right now we can't pay teachers what they deserve to be paid when we're talking about when we're talking about exchanging. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7578.895s">in</a> the grand scheme of things, relatively small amounts of money here and there when we're talking about cutting staff costs, that can save money in a given fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7591.021s">It</a> does not save money in the long term. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7593.082s">We</a> need to start thinking about fiscal responsibility in terms of investing in ourselves in the long term, not saving money in the very short term. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7603.287s">I</a> would, but yes, I, <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7606.184s">Once</a> again, I very much sympathize with the teacher's views on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7611.388s">The</a> optics are terrible, and I appreciate your presence here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7616.952s">Thank</a> you very much for your time.<h2><a href="../2024-06-01_FdTFgwr9fdA/2024-06-01_FdTFgwr9fdA.html">City Council 01-09-24</a></h2>

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=1996.859s">Yeah,</a> just, Sunday hours are listed twice here on this resolution, so just for clarification, are you proposing to open until 12.30 or 12 on Sunday? <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=2007.847s">It's</a> just listed twice.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4095.762s">Yeah,</a> just a question as a new Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4098.504s">Does</a> the lower requirement for quorum affect open meeting law? <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4103.568s">So</a> are fewer Councilors allowed to meet outside to discuss committee-specific work?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4933.376s">Just</a> a question for Councilor Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=4935.738s">In</a> your years working with and running the Malden Warming Shelter, could you just give us an idea of how many people that came into the shelter were evicted during the winter months, just to offer an idea of how many this resolution would likely affect?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5033.663s">Yeah,</a> I mean, it seems like a pretty common sense thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5036.765s">If</a> you got evicted in the winter, that could potentially be lethal. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5040.467s">So</a> just having rules in place to prevent that from happening definitely seems worth this body's time.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5677.674s">I'd</a> like to thank Vice President Collins for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5681.556s">I</a> knocked on a lot of doors this past campaign and a lot of people that I spoke to are small landlords that oftentimes rent below market rates who are <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5694.702s">who</a> were sometimes comparing themselves to other landlords that lived a few towns over and never maintained their properties, essentially see land in Medford as something which they can extract as much money from as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5709.852s">And</a> I very much sympathize with what Councilor Callaghan was saying, that it is oftentimes difficult when digging through state code to try to find ways of distinguishing between one type of landlord and the other type of landlord. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5723.501s">And</a> this is a very <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5725.022s">it's</a> a good tool for doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5728.124s">The</a> other thing I'd like to point out is beyond incentivizing lower rents, which is a city council now that I believe has a majority of renters on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5738.831s">If</a> that was counting correctly, it also can be used to incentivize landlords who actively maintain their properties, <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5750.68s">who</a> choose to do repairs on time, who really take care of their tenants in that way too. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5756.484s">So</a> I think that this is something that potentially a lot more people could get behind because it will incentivize basically upkeep in Medford if it's implemented correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/FdTFgwr9fdA&t=5768.531s">So</a> thank you very much.

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=159.92s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=160.56s">So</a> I moved to Medford during COVID. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=164.563s">It</a> was just after I finished my PhD. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=169.085s">I</a> got a job here and I immediately fell in love with the place. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=173.948s">It</a> was <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=175.589s">Like,</a> I just really like the vibe, I really like the people, and I started looking around thinking, okay, you know, I'm a postdoc, we don't really make a whole lot of money as really career scientists, I was renting with two roommates, and I started looking around on Zillow, like, okay, if I want to buy a med for, like, what are my options? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=199.165s">And</a> I couldn't really find anything below like $600,000, which for my salary would require, like, it would require, the down payment for that loan would require more than one year salary for me, 6% mortgage rates. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=214.584s">And</a> I was kind of thinking, okay, what is happening here? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=219.73s">So,</a> I got involved in a lot of affordable housing activism. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=224.054s">I</a> ended up joining a local Unitarian church and with the folks there just started getting involved in groups like Housing Medford, Greater Boston Interfaith Organization, and eventually getting to positions where we were <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=239.85s">Just</a> constantly annoying and talking with city Councilors about passing different ordinances like the Affordable Housing Trust Getting involved in state-level advocacy that would discourage Speculation housing speculation by big real estate companies, you know just through through you you I put on and well me and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=265.398s">As</a> other members of the Church of Social Justice Committee, we put on a forum about affordable housing, just trying to educate people on these issues. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=277.281s">It's</a> a very complex topic. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=279.282s">It</a> spans just like, you know, it sort of, there's this weird intersection, affordable housing, between like <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=286.664s">just</a> the global economy, the demand side of it, as well as just the very local city council level stuff, so building affordable housing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=295.729s">And</a> so the goal of that was really to educate people. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=298.89s">And</a> so the day after the 2022 elections, a couple of the city councilors approached me. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=305.893s">They</a> said, look, we see that you're really involved in this. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=309.135s">We</a> see that you're really passionate about these issues. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=312.477s">Would</a> you be interested in potentially <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=315.418s">Running</a> for City Council and my initial reaction was like, oh, okay. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=321.821s">Well</a> I'm not totally sure but you know, I talked with I talked with a lot of people about it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=328.424s">Just</a> the prop just the very <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=331.246s">weird</a> back-end process of like campaigning, getting like door-knocking, getting the technical infrastructure up. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=338.173s">And</a> I said, okay, you know, I'm a young person. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=340.675s">I</a> have generally a lot of energy. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=343.698s">I</a> have the ability to sit in committee meetings for several hours at a time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=348.923s">So</a> I said, okay, yeah, let's do this. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=353.342s">So</a> that is, yeah, that is how I decided to get involved.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=372.258s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=372.498s">So</a> the three, okay. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=374.1s">So</a> the three parts of my platform that have been really trying to push. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=378.964s">So</a> I've been studying a lot more than this, but the three parts of it is affordable housing, which I just talked about. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=384.589s">Medford</a> needs to build more. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=386.431s">We</a> need to make it so that people can live here without putting 70% of their income towards rent. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=392.696s">We</a> also need a way to pay for that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=396.539s">So</a> one of Medford's biggest problems right now is that there's not enough money coming into the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=404.906s">Like</a> if you look around the city, there's just a lot of storefronts that are sitting empty. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=409.59s">A</a> part of my platform is a commercial vacancy tax to discourage that kind of speculative squatting. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=417.616s">And</a> generally trying to make Medford a place where people want to go in the evenings, people want to spend time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=425.978s">The</a> third part of that is inclusivity. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=429.719s">So</a> trying to make local politics in Medford generally a place that more people around the city feel like they can easily enter into. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=439.902s">So</a> when I first moved here, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=444.003s">I,</a> you know, I'm a person that really likes to be involved in wherever I'm at. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=448.645s">I</a> was just a student government nerd just all throughout school in my very, um, it's probably overly extended educational period. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=458.248s">I</a> was just involved in committees all throughout that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=460.229s">And</a> so I was like, okay, well I want to get involved in real government now, you know, like local stuff. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=468.092s">Um,</a> and my experience with that was I submitted, like, you know, the city put out a couple of advertisements about, you know, apply to the city board or whatever. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=477.657s">Um,</a> I can't even remember which city board it was at the time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=480.478s">And</a> I very carefully prepared a resume. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=482.8s">I</a> submitted it to them and nothing happened. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=486.621s">It</a> was like putting a piece of paper into a black hole, no response, nothing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=491.844s">From</a> the city's perspective, an experience like that is really not that important. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=496.648s">Like</a> it's just, it's barely a blip on their radar, but to somebody who wants to get involved, who's not necessarily, doesn't necessarily know what's going on, that experience just is, what that says to them is, okay, there is a very high barrier to entry. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=511.599s">I</a> need to know people. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=512.84s">I</a> need to like network around the right circles. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=515.002s">And</a> that really should not be the experience of people who want to get involved. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=520.506s">Right</a> now, the people on city boards are generally, you know, I work with them a lot, they're wonderful people, but they're generally all like sort of know each other, come from like the same groups. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=531.391s">And</a> my goal is to try to reach out to pockets of people or engage people who <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=538.714s">know</a> those pockets of people and say, okay, you know, we don't want you to just feel welcome. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=543.918s">We</a> want to actively reach out and say, okay, you know, can you get this person who doesn't really know a whole lot about the city and just have them apply to a board, have them apply to a committee, have them engaged in events that gives them a voice in local politics. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=560.89s">Like</a> this is a hugely important topic. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=563.192s">It</a> affects our lives. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=564.913s">Much</a> more than I think a lot of people realize so that's One of my goals as a city councilor.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=613.207s">You</a> know, and I mean, there's, I mean, there's, um, sort of a lot, a lot of areas just where there's work to be done there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=621.771s">So,</a> you know, I, I consider myself to be a progressive. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=626.474s">Um,</a> but I'm also like. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=628.995s">One</a> of my goals really in doing this is to try to build bridges between people in the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=636.299s">So</a> one thing that I hear a lot, you know, as a relatively recent transplant to the city, my method for getting to know more about Medford history, Medford politics, is just to go up to people who've lived here for a lot longer than me and say, Oh, hey, just, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=653.487s">you</a> know, tell me about this or I'll say something that's like, just my working theory of how something works. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=659.813s">And</a> then one of the older residents will say, Oh, that, that doesn't work. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=663.296s">They</a> try that 20 years and I'm like, I'll just listen. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=665.458s">You</a> know, so my, my really my way of sort of knowing what's going on is just to kind of like listen to people, get them talking. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=676.869s">There</a> were some listening workshops that we had in grad school and they've been incredibly helpful just for communication for me in general. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=686.163s">What,</a> like the stories that I kind of hear around Medford is that there's sort of like, there's what people call old Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=694.145s">So</a> I'm friends here with people whose families have been around since like the 1600s, um, like multi-generational or like lifelong residents. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=701.826s">And</a> I'm friends here with people who they moved here relatively recently. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=706.687s">Medford</a> is one of the fastest growing cities in America. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=709.608s">There</a> was a recent article about that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=712.208s">And</a> sort of what people are like what people tell me is that in terms of politics There's like these two groups tend to clash what I really want to want to do is to reach out to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=726.875s">the</a> is reach out to residents that have been here a while and residents that, you know, are more recent because that's just the reality that we live in. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=736.403s">A</a> lot of younger people do tend to live in multiple cities, I think, you know, but they're still stakeholders. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=742.287s">They</a> still need to be involved and say, you know, let's try to make this work for everybody. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=749.013s">Um,</a> you know, I, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=752.193s">I'm</a> a Unitarian, so I very much care about making sure that anybody from any race, religion, gender identity, sexuality feels engaged, needed, in the process, supported. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=766.381s">I'm</a> also a military officer. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=769.363s">I</a> feel like it's very important to me to make sure that veterans, first responders, et cetera, know that they're appreciated and know that <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=778.908s">you</a> know, I really want to have them in the fold. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=782.451s">And</a> so that's, and I'm very aware that there's been sort of conflicts going on there in the past, but like, I really just want to try to fix, like, heal that, naive as I may sound, and say, okay, um, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=800.745s">You</a> know, we need change in Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=803.008s">We</a> need to build things. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=803.989s">We've</a> been in gridlock for a while. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=805.611s">Not</a> a whole lot has been built. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=807.233s">What</a> can we do to make that work for everybody?
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=839.826s">Affordable</a> housing does tend to be one of those. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=842.989s">It</a> is a very polarizing topic and it's something that needs to be approached. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=852.777s">handle</a> carefully. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=854.118s">So,</a> you know, young people, we don't want to be paying like 70 plus percent of our salaries and rent. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=860.102s">We</a> want to be able to invest and buy. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=862.304s">Um,</a> I went to the senior center the other day for one of their events. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=866.486s">I</a> started talking to people and they were saying, you know, we don't want our, like, we don't want our home prices to be completely devalued. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=875.492s">So,</a> you know, you're talking about affordable housing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=878.134s">Well,</a> this is our entire <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=880.016s">life's</a> income and that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=880.859s">That's</a> their nest egg. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=887.247s">It's</a> a matter of balance. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=888.567s">I</a> think something that everybody can sort of get behind in terms of affordable housing is we do need to build more. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=896.689s">Rezoning</a> in the city is incredibly important. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=898.929s">Like</a> there's affordable housing that can be built on top of, for instance, storefronts in Medford Square and South Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=905.211s">And</a> so the rezoning process is critical in making sure that there is money in Medford to actually pay for those affordable housing projects when they come around. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=917.473s">So,</a> recently the City Council, with a lot of lobbying from Housing Medford, passed the Affordable Housing Trust, and this is basically a pile of money that can be used to build affordable housing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=933.827s">like</a> a lot of other municipalities had that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=936.288s">It</a> took us a while to get there, but now we're there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=938.529s">And</a> so the idea, what needs to be done is to come up with revenue streams to sort of build up that pile. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=946.633s">And</a> then once rezoning is done, once, you know, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=951.635s">that</a> process happens and there are people really trying to push that through, then we are actually able to build housing in more places that residents need it without necessarily devaluing the properties of seniors who've invested their entire life's income into their property. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=974.861s">So</a> there are ways to make this work for everybody. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=980.193s">that</a> city, that city councils can affect.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1005.169s">Well,</a> okay, so, I mean, you're involved. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1008.351s">You're</a> involved in this as well. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1010.512s">And</a> I resigned when I began the campaign, but I would say that the Medford Charter Study Committee is hugely important. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1021.377s">It's</a> also probably one of the more <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1025.619s">boring</a> I want to say tasks most misunderstood things but part of my platform and It's not it's not front and center because I'm aware that most people don't really aren't really too aware of like what the charter is Or it's important, but the time I did spend on the Medford Charter Study Committee I realized how critical it is to really, you know changing things in the city So <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1052.535s">But</a> basically taking a step back, Medford has a charter, which is sort of like its governing document, you know, the constitution for the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1062.144s">And</a> so far what we've kind of, what we did on the Medford Charter Study Committee was we realized that Medford's charter, you know, it's <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1071.172s">uh,</a> just not a very well written document. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1075.054s">You</a> know, it's, it's very incomplete. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1077.436s">If</a> you read the whole document, you don't really know how the city government in Medford works. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1083.9s">A</a> lot of it defaults to state law in many places. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1086.221s">And</a> so it needs to be, uh, reviewed. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1089.863s">It</a> needs to be, um, uh, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1094.767s">changed</a> potentially and as a city councilor I've kind of glued myself to supporting the work of the Charter Study Committee just because you know what <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1107.038s">You</a> know, it's a committee that is taking expert feedback. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1110.3s">It's</a> a committee that's taking public feedback to understand, you know, just review all these issues like do we need at-large award-based representation? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1119.425s">Do</a> we, like, should there be term limits? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1123.727s">Should</a> we have <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1126.089s">a</a> strong mayoral system. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1129.37s">What</a> should the relationship between the city council and the mayor look like? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1135.273s">And</a> these issues are very critical for sort of forming the political landscape within Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1143.657s">So</a> that is a piece of work that I would really like to emphasize and really like to point out the importance of it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1152.321s">Just</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1154.045s">Generally</a> speaking, the work that's being done by the Community Preservation Committee is also very important there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1162.349s">So,</a> they're overseeing the state-funded affordable housing projects, which is Walkling Court, and really trying to get more units into that and collecting public feedback for doing that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1180.197s">I'm</a> on the Community Preservation Committee, so that is a project that is hugely important as well. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1187.5s">Really,</a> any affordable housing projects that do come up in Medford, because they only come along once every few years, and when they do hit, it's very important to have the city be ready to support that as well as they can.
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1246.939s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1247.199s">The</a> meetings are public. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1248.88s">Anybody</a> can attend. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1249.941s">They're</a> very educational. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1251.962s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1252.503s">And</a> you know, we're not, I don't think it, everybody should be expected to be an expert on, uh, municipal charters, but just attending one or two meetings, it becomes pretty, uh, pretty eyeopening. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1266.392s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1267.533s">But</a> yes, as a city councilor, I really want to, I will support the work of the Charter Study Committee that they're doing in the future. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1280.125s">So</a> at this point, like,
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1302.57s">document</a> is incomplete and possibly poorly written because I think when a lot of folks look at legalese it's really easy to think like well I probably just don't get it and the capital necessary to say this is this is a mess it needs to be rewritten is helpful yeah no it uh I mean when people say like when people say you know charter review they think oh you want to change everything about the city and it's like okay so you know we the charter should be changed but <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1330.832s">we're</a> not even like we're not even necessarily suggesting like like substantial political changes it should just be better written you know the document should be in a state where if somebody reads the entire thing and they're not an expert in state law they should be able to know how metford operates and it's not currently in that state i think our charter is like what like a couple pages of that and most charters are like
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1365.226s">I</a> think so just like lots of stuff Yeah, well we could talk about this forever, but um, thank you for sharing so
 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1397.141s">Really,</a> it's <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1399.838s">The</a> people that are willing to dedicate so much of their free time to making this place run. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1406.082s">I</a> mean, y'all are a great example of that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1408.943s">You're</a> running a podcast just about Medford topics. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1415.647s">Not</a> to be taken for granted like the you know, their local journalism has been decimated in recent years and just having Outlets that people know what's going on. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1425.419s">It's</a> usually important. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1426.521s">There</a> was the former chair of the Medford Charter Study Committee Laurel she <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1433.929s">recently</a> resigned to take a job in City Hall, she spent so much of her time making a community arts center happen. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1441.094s">There's</a> just different groups like Safe Medford, Housing Medford, there's all those city boards we were talking about earlier. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1448.519s">Those</a> are by and large, a few of them have minor stipends, but by and large, it's people dedicating their free time just to make the city run. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1460.006s">that</a> is some like, I'd say like, that's what attracted me most about it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1463.769s">Just</a> like the amount of people who really want to just dedicate a huge portion of their lives to making this place happen. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1471.895s">So</a> that is what I appreciate about it.

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1487.539s">This</a> was something that we were sort of, that I was like, kind of, that I was kind of like kind of like, I was like, okay. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1491.882s">Um,</a> so I, you know, I'm a product of an military family. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1497.306s">I</a> went to 13 different schools across five States before I turned 18. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1503.57s">So</a> I've kind of been, I, you know, there's a lot of moving around there in high school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1509.955s">I.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1511.968s">was</a> voted my, my superlative was most unique, which was something, it was something that I really, that I was really proud of. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1519.594s">Cause</a> like, you know, I, I tend to dress like in a very like standard nonchalant way, but I was always hanging out with art students in high school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1529.041s">And</a> so when I got the most unique superlative, like my best friend was just kind of jealous. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1533.745s">I</a> was like, you don't even dress weird. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1537.988s">So</a> I was like, yeah. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1541.505s">So</a> it was a point of pride for me.

 <p>[Matt Leming]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1767.842s">There</a> is. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1768.342s">So</a> that's September 12th. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1769.642s">It's</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1772.443s">So</a> the, the primary is a little bit weird because I believe, so the way it works is that if there are, there are seven city council seats, if there are, um, less than 14, if there are 14 or fewer declared candidates, then they don't have a primary and go to the elections office to like, but I believe this is how it works. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1793.239s">If</a> there are more than there are like, you know, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1796.581s">you</a> know, 16 or so declared candidates, then they will have a primary on September 12th. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1802.13s">The</a> top 14 of those then go on to the generals. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1804.554s">So</a> in election years where like <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1810.866s">you</a> know, it's like a state rep level thing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1814.127s">The</a> primary is like the most important election. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1817.548s">Um,</a> but in you in municipal elections, it's the general election on the 7th. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1822.629s">That's</a> really the most important one. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1824.049s">So</a> yes, vote on the primary as well though. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1827.45s">That</a> would be very much appreciated. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/45H9z12dNGjpYGkxbQMaLB?t=1828.91s">September</a> 12th and then November 7th.
