    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=729.367s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I just want to, my point of view is I think the city is doing a good thing with the push of this council and Council Marks putting in the thermoplastic sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=738.829s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I know we're doing a pilot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=740.089s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We are doing a pilot program for three crosswalks in the city that should be done within the next<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=745.785s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think it was four or five months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=747.805s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I think we are moving in a step in the right direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=750.786s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: If that works, I do agree that we should do many more throughout our community at a rate that we can afford, whether it's five or six per year, however much it costs, that we are able just to afford being able to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=764.529s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: But I think it is a way to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=766.129s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I mean, the paint, I agree, lasts not even a full season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=770.811s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And we makes it through to the beginning of fall and it's just not effective for the rest of the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=776.934s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So that is a way to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=777.955s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I just want to make sure that we see how the pilot program goes and do it in stages so that we can afford it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4409.789s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you, President Mayocko.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4411.53s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: My issue comes just with financial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4414.131s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Not only we have the budget coming up, but the number of bonds that are on the books.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4419.813s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Currently, I'd like to see a breakdown of—we've got breakdowns before, but I'd like to see a breakdown of what is owed, what will be owed each year for each bond, a total of what is owed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4431.602s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'd also like, for what we currently have, and then on a second spreadsheet, a breakdown of not only what is currently owed, but also an estimate on what the DPW department to rebuild is going to cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4445.553s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'd like that added to the bond worksheet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4449.631s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: as well as we need an update on what's going on with the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4453.854s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We basically, you know, I believe it needs to be expanded on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4458.858s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I don't think evidence being housed in a garage is sufficient, adequate, or reasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4465.423s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think we need to expand on the police department, but we need to know what the mayor and the city administration is gonna do, whether it's, I don't think it's gonna be rebuilt, but whether it be expand,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4479.304s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: rework, refurbish what we need to do at the police station, I'd like that included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4485.168s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'd also like, now we have a three point, I believe it's a $3.3 million bond that they want to put on the books for the pool at 3%, so that's gonna be a good amount, I'd say 80 to $100,000 a year that we're gonna have to pay back per year on the pool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4506.109s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I'd just like to see the figures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4507.75s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: What are we putting on the books?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4508.991s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: What are we going to have to pay back from now until the next 15 years?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4512.974s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We need to be able to evaluate that along with the next budget before we can make the decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4520.26s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I mean, everybody wants to see a brand new pool, brand new locker rooms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4523.563s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I am one of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4525.024s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: But at the same time, we have the rate payers who are basically screaming to us, what are you doing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4530.448s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: How much money can you spend over a three-year period?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4533.325s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: and we have essentials that need to get done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4535.406s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We do not have a DPW yard now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4537.468s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It has to be rebuilt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4539.089s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We had to do what we had to do with the police station, and we have to continue to figure out what the mayor wants to do with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4546.293s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We need to be able to evaluate it all before we can make a recommendation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4549.535s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'd like to ask for it by next Tuesday, because I know we're in line to get about $500,000 to go toward the $600,000 for the locker rooms of the pool, and time is of the essence for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4563.558s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: But if so, if we could get this breakdown, hopefully within the next week, it would be appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4568.081s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It would help me make a determination, um, not only for the students and those who use the pool, but for the, the community as a whole to, to move forward most appropriately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4840.502s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Just to further amend it to include, um, a lift to the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4845.876s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: above ground spectator, um, room to, to investigate the cost of, uh, they said about 30,000 to put in a lift.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4862.701s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7739.387s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: To the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7743.188s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Clerk Finn, were you able to go to the location?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7985.142s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Liability insurance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=201.534s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think maybe we could do a reverse 911 call<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=205.171s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: to go out, request to go out tomorrow or the next day to notify people that there is the extension, where to send the letters, and also go on the city website if you want more information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=319.488s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: If I may through the chair, I just want to thank the speaker and all those that spoke last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=324.271s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: There was about five people here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=326.661s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: advocating for the extension of the common period and their ability to get notification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=331.625s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think that's important and they're doing it for hundreds of people in that neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=335.268s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I would just ask that we take a roll call vote, that a reverse 911 call go out tomorrow, notifying not only everybody in that neighborhood, but the entire city that there's a common period has been extended, the date, list the date and the address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=803.808s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Council Member O'Karn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=804.988s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=805.648s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: President Carviello, I just want to thank my colleagues also for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=810.611s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It is a concerning spot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=812.371s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: There is nothing at that location to shield anybody from any elements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=816.973s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think the location of it definitely discourages residents that live<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=821.363s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: in the Lawrence Estates and those who would use that transportation spot, I think it definitely deters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=828.304s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The use in a bus shelter would go such a long way, and I think it would encourage many, many more residents in this community to stop using their cars, to drive into Wellington Park and take the T, and definitely use the bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=841.847s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think it's definitely needed, and I agree with giving a few weeks to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=846.055s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: at least get some sort of response and seeing what we can do as a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=849.797s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Hopefully the mayor can get on board trying to push the MBTA with us to create a shelter there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=856.081s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think it's extremely important and I agree wholeheartedly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=858.843s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I second the approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=859.864s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1233.671s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you, President Carviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1235.312s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think the council in the last year or so has learned a great deal about community aggregation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1241.035s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We've had a number of meetings relating to it, and we also have had a very informative meeting back, I believe, in September with the energy environment director in Melrose, which I think,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1255.748s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: personally, for me, helped answer a lot of my questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1259.57s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And it was great to see another community and how the plan is succeeding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1263.672s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think one concern I do have is just Medford's ability to notify people of their rights and the ability to opt out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1276.44s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And when I do get emails or phone calls or people stop me in the street to talk about community aggregation, 80% want to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1284.591s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: move forward with it and implement it in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1287.874s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: But there are some, a good 20% if I, just going off the people that contact me, there are people that don't want government telling them what to do, what plan to go into, and they too are concerned that this 30-day opt-out, when it does become available, if potentially the council is to vote for it, there's just many concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1311.392s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: They want to make sure that that opt-out plan is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1314.781s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: well publicized, and people know how to do it, and where to go, and who to talk to, who to ask questions to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1320.906s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And one resident brought this up to me, and we discussed it in depth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1324.87s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: What if an opt-out plan was implemented, just even a database, a list of people that would relieve some of the 20% that I'm calculating from the people that I talk to, relieve them of their fears, and let them know that, no, we're not going to hide the fact that you can opt out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1342.421s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: If you want to, you can do it now, just in case something is implemented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1347.224s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I know it's a reach, but it's something that was requested by a resident, and I don't think it's a bad idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1353.428s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think the community aggregation is something that we're going to talk about within the next several months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1359.011s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And we just need to be ready on all accounts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1361.552s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I move this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1363.073s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think it's definitely something worth exploring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1365.935s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1366.655s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's just a database.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1368.336s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It could be an Excel spreadsheet of people that want to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1372.066s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: listed as not being involved in this community aggregation from the get-go, and it would give a peace of mind to those who are not interested, and maybe it would help us get the votes, maybe unanimous, maybe not, but it would get votes to implement the plan, which I know a large percentage of Medford wants to work on and work towards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1869.401s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you, President Carviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1872.101s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I understand the sentiments of my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1875.402s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I just, I don't feel, I have to just speak again on it, I guess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1879.063s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I don't feel that it would take a great amount of resources to start an Excel spreadsheet and people<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1885.086s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: call or write in, shoot a quick email to say they want to be on the opt-out list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1888.827s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I actually think that it would ease a lot of people's fears, those that definitely do not want to be part of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1895.33s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think it's simple, take minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1897.771s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I agree with Councilor DelaRusso, there is an agenda for the Office of Environment and Energy, but I don't think that that's what the people are concerned about, that the agenda won't be notifying people accordingly on their<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1913.61s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: option to opt out, how many days they have to do it, and the fact that they can opt out whenever, they're going to be put in if they don't opt out within that first 30 days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1923.816s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And that's what people are concerned about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1925.597s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So that's why you would implement something like this far beforehand, and you would be able to create that list, and people would be able to say, I want to opt out, and they would get what they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1940.425s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The people that don't want to be involved<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1942.193s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: would be able to do that sooner than later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1944.514s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And when the council does meet in committee of the whole again, maybe there would be the definite votes for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1949.897s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I think we're definitely close to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1951.818s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I know people have definitely changed their minds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1954.9s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And they've learned a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1956.381s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: There are some people that maybe are still against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1958.462s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: But for me, this is something that would make me feel a whole lot better knowing that they have more than that 30 days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1965.286s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Because that's the complaints I've been getting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1968.048s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I thought this was just a way<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1971.806s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: sway another vote towards approving it and ease in people's fears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1976.411s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'll say it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1977.412s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1979.234s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'd like to see how it goes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1981.937s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And of course, we'll be meeting on it again in Committee of the Whole, probably after the holidays.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2401.493s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you, President Carviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2403.754s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We had met with Eversource last week and I know that a number of councilors asked questions with regards to the water pipes that are going to be closely<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2415.928s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Doug Nair above or beside the Eversource pipes, and I know a number of ours are, we all know, they're 100 plus years old, and they are in need of replacement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2429.054s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Now, I forget which councilor, but we all pushed to try to get Eversource to replace our water pipes, and they said they would approach it on a case-by-case basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2441.34s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I just wanna make sure that the city administration<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2445.191s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: really is on top of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2446.272s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I know Cassandra is going to be on top of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2448.112s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: She seemed very eager to get Eversource to pay for the majority of this work, but they wouldn't commit to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2456.056s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I think it's very important that the administration really keeps a solid eye on this and whether or not Eversource replaces the water pipes that are going to need replacing, that we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2468.226s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We look into doing this, whether this, in funding I'm sure is going to have to be appropriated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2473.169s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So we think about this before our streets are even open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2476.311s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I don't know if the administration has already thought about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2479.172s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Obviously, I understand we're going to try to get Eversource to pay for as much as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2483.274s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: But no matter what, I think these pipes need replacing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2487.257s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I think we need to definitely be proactive in making sure they do get replaced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2493.786s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: couple miles worth of digging up that Eversource is going to do in our streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2498.429s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think this should be paid for by Eversource, but our residents definitely deserve our infrastructure to be replaced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2506.654s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And when the street's being dug up, I think it's important that we do it then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2510.596s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So whatever we have to do to get Eversource to pay for as much as possible and the city come up with the rest, I think it's important, especially if we go in there and we find very old piping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2621.34s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Let me answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3920.186s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you, President Carviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3922.407s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I too have just concerns, not only about the capital plan, but I voiced my concerns last week and requested that we sit down with the administration with regards to not only the entire capital plan and where the Brooks Estates fits into that, but also<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3939.677s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: how we plan on moving forward with the restored or rehabbed building if we do spend the $200,000 to rehab it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3948.901s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I know that paper was failed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3950.562s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think my questions could have been answered in a committee of the whole meeting, but we didn't have that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3955.904s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I did reach out to Paul Mokey from the building department because I did have some questions, one of which was, if we do put $200,000 into the Carriage House<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3969.662s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: stabilize it, how long will that last us and how can it be used?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3975.964s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Briefly, he did mention that he thinks it would stabilize the building for, I'm going to read a word for it, around five years or so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3985.566s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So say then between four and six years, this building will be stabilized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3991.047s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: He then went on to say that people could go in it, but you couldn't necessarily, and I'm not speaking for him, I did speak to him over the phone and I did email with him, but people couldn't necessarily be of use within the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4005.555s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Then I reached out to the mayor's office yesterday morning and thankfully got a little bit of a response, which was any future, I asked, what is the plan, what's the vision, if we stabilize this building,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4019.835s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: how are we going to move forward, not only with CPA funds, but how are we going to move forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4024.176s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And the answer was any future work for the Brooks Estates to be considered for funding through the CPA, which is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4032.599s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think we have a good amount of money in the CPA that is in will and should go to a number of different things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4043.081s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So in my head, calculating it a little bit, if you even took half of the CPA funds,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4049.275s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: to rehab the building, and obviously you need the money to fix the road so that it could be economically viable as an option for a function facility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4058.702s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: You need the $4 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4060.863s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Even if you took half of the CPA funds, you would only come up with between $2.5 and $3 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4069.309s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: You wouldn't have the funds to rehab the building for the purpose that, you know, the committee has obviously presented to us in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4079.414s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And that's where I find it concerning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4081.615s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Yes, this building needs to be stabilized, but if we're going to spend the $200,000, I want to know that it's for a purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4089.621s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I didn't get that answer from the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4092.643s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Are we going to use any of city monies to... And those are the questions that I think still are outstanding and need to be answered for my vote because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4104.73s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Yes, I would want to stabilize the building, but I want to know the plan, not only for that, but for the fire stations, for the roads, for all the other complaints that we get and money that we need to spend money on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4116.96s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think of the fire department taking the tour, and where they shower, there is like mold coming out of the bottom of the stalls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4123.506s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And nobody talks about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4126.648s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We're not asked to put money towards fixing the bathrooms in the fire department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4130.471s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: There's just so many different needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4134.477s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think the last time we got the capital plan was last January, February, two years ago, almost two years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4140.681s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And we sat with the mayor for an hour, we looked at the capital plan, and I think this was a component in the capital plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4147.366s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It didn't pass two years ago, and now it's before us again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4150.107s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I just think after two years, we need to sit down with the mayor as soon as next week and discuss how we're gonna move forward with the Brooks Estate, and how we're gonna move forward in this city entirely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4164.662s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: can't receive a paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4166.383s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Last week I did table it, because what the paper said was, please approve $200,000 for the Brooks Estates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4172.484s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thankfully, the Brooks Estates had somewhat of a breakdown, which was more than we sometimes get from the city administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4180.487s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: But for Paul Mokey to not even know it came before us last week, and not really, he's going to be, the building department is going to be involved in all of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4190.51s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And for him to not even know, never mind be available to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4193.539s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: answer our questions in a committee of the whole meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4195.62s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I find that extremely concerning for the taxpayers in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4200.081s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: If I voted for this tonight or last week, I wouldn't be able to answer their questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4203.943s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I wouldn't be able to say necessarily what the plan was or what I was even necessarily fully voting on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4212.086s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I don't think that's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4214.027s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I again ask that we just sit with the mayor and discuss this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4217.228s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: You very well may have my vote next week if I sit with the mayor and just figure out her vision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4223.806s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: for a million to a million and a half to do a road, plus the rehab to completely redo the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4230.387s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And then it hit the nail on the head last week when the new member of the board, who was very well-spoken, did mention that, why don't we take it down and rebuild it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4239.509s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I think one of the councilors said that a couple years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4241.849s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It was me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4242.469s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Yeah, Councilor Carvillo, you said that, why don't we rebuild it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4245.15s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It would cost us less money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4247.21s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I mean, nobody wants it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4249.111s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We want to preserve it, but it's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4251.752s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: You have to be realistic in a way where we have needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4256.293s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: People want a library.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4257.693s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: People want new fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4260.174s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We're building a new police station for millions and millions of dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4263.394s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We have needs and maintenance issues in our schools that need to be addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4268.055s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So where does this fit in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4270.876s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And that's where I'm concerned tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4272.616s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's where I was concerned last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4275.297s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Forget about personnel that we need to hire and to make our police and fire to the staffing levels that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4281.284s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: people, you know, the city wants, there's just so much that goes into this money papers and we never get a good enough, we usually always meet in the Committee of the Whole, we get our questions answered, we discuss it, we round table it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4295.23s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: For this, you know, we obviously didn't meet in Committee of the Whole and I practically begged for it last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4300.512s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think we need a meeting with the mayor on this one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4647.163s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I just want to note my opposition because I believe<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4651.26s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Questions need to be answered, even if it just took a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=0.089s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: an executive session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=1.229s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'm happy to announce that by unanimous vote, we took a major step to pay equity for our Kids Corner and paraprofessionals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=14.555s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So that was a 7-0 vote, and those contracts have been ratified, which is great news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Hrp-yhRlWGw&t=22.938s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We also want to welcome back Domenico Bruno and Melanie Chavez.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2733.422s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2734.123s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you, president bears and counselors for allowing me some time to speak to you about the fiscal year 25 budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2740.568s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Before I begin, I must take this opportunity to thank everyone who contributed to the completing this budget and delivering it to your honorable body by the newly established deadline per the budget ordinance, compiling this comprehensive breakdown of the city's financial outlook took countless hours of preparation, debate, and insight from our department heads and our budget team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2760.902s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: led by our Finance Director, Bob Dickinson, Assistant Finance Director and Budget Director, Courtney Cardillo, and my team in the Mayor's Office, led by Chief of Staff Nina Nazarian.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2770.875s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I also need to credit both Courtney and our Communications Team, Director Steve Smerdy,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2775.532s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: and Emma Tombley, our communications specialist for putting in so many hours of work on the nitty gritty aspects of the budget book that tend to get overlooked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2785.38s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: This work is invaluable and will hopefully lead us to a second Distinguished Budget Award from the Government Finance Officers Association.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2794.915s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Last year, I stood before you and laid out the challenges that lay ahead for fiscal year 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2800.018s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Our looming fiscal cliff due to the expiration of ARPA and ESSER funding, the continued rise in consumer prices, as well as the decades of neglect of critical infrastructure upkeep as it relates to our roads, sidewalks, water and sewer infrastructure system that are catching up to us now, including our buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2822.97s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Most of these are not new or surprising obstacles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2826.052s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: They have always been at the forefront of financial planning, guiding our strategy and shaping the decisions we make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2832.015s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Now, as we approach the end date, it's important to understand that measures we must take to ensure that our city and school services, programs and projects are properly funded and staffed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2842.714s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: As I wrote in my budget message last week, the school's budget was by far the toughest one to develop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2848.677s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Due to the timeline of the budget ordinance, we needed to supply the school department with an estimated operating budget figure in March.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2855.8s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: At that time, we did not have concrete figures for the city's previous year's actuals or next year's projections, thus making the school's number more of a guide than a strict dollar amount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2866.425s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: But it's no secret that the schools used the remaining ESSER funds last year<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2871.305s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: and are operating at a deficit, committing one-time funding sources to plug this gap continually is not a long-term solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2879.528s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The school budget was facing a cliff, and cuts had to be made to right-size our spending and balance the fiscal year 25 budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2887.39s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Our city team then thoroughly reviewed each line item on the city side, dove deeply into expenditures, compared numbers with previous year's actuals, and worked to bring those figures down to a more reasonable and sustainable level in order to provide as much funding to the schools as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2904.756s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Additionally, we reviewed our new growth numbers, workers' compensation numbers, assessed IT vendor contracts, and really dove headfirst into the fine details of the city budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2915.384s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The hard work over the last two months adjusting the city budget revenue projections and other city line items allowed us to increase the school budget from our fiscal year 24 numbers of 71,200,000 to 76 million for fiscal year 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2931.668s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That's nearly a 7% increase of general fund allocated monies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2936.709s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'm immensely proud that we're able to come to this number and supply the schools with a significant increase from last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2943.285s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: but it's still not enough to avoid cuts and creates additional obstacles to learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2949.848s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think it's important to understand just how we've gotten to this point at both the school district and city hall, with each budget season being such a challenging and in many ways, a discouraging process for all involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2963.394s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Each year, the budget I propose and the budget that this honorable body votes on is balanced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2969.042s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And while that allows us to pay for all our obligations, it creates a situation where most of our costs, which generally significantly increase year over year, exceed the amount we're able to raise in taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2981.148s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Per Massachusetts general law, Medford and all other municipalities in the Commonwealth cannot increase our tax levy, which is one of the major components of the city's revenue sources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2990.572s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We raise from real and property taxes by more than 2.5%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2996.909s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: meeting the operating budget can't keep up the cost of living.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3000.991s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: This in some cases creates the need for scaled back programming, staff reductions and other resource losses to properly balance the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3011.021s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I know there has been some discussion on rating our reserve funds to plug our structural deficit gap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3016.502s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That is not sound financial practice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3019.003s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Dipping into our savings to fund something for one year is just simply a bad idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3023.964s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's why our team worked so hard to reduce our reliance on one-time funding to offset revenue loss in my previous four budgets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3031.752s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The funding we received from the federal government with the passage of the American Rescue Plan Act, also known as ARPA, allowed us to inject capital to plug various gaps during the early years of the pandemic when revenues were down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3044.764s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: By making strategic one-time investments, we were able to save on annual operating budget space, which created more flexibility when crafting the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3052.952s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The pandemic also caused us to reevaluate much of our thinking on the use of one-time funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3057.981s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It also changed the way the public interacts with government, so much so that we now must allocate funding to new items that have become essential as post-pandemic life continues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3068.467s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: For example, prior to 2020, City Hall did not regularly host meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3073.91s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Now that is common and expected practice, which requires more resources, technology, infrastructure, and staff training, which all carry an expense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3082.775s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That brings us to an override measure, which I'm proposing to appear on the ballot in November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3087.773s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: This has been a topic of debate in the council chambers, my email box, in homes, coffee shops, ball fields, and around our squares for several years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3097.203s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think two things are simultaneously true as it relates to an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3101.387s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It would undoubtedly help us maintain and hopefully enhance our services, and it would create hardships for many people in our city struggling to stay afloat financially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3112.594s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Our financial task force established earlier this year has been meeting regularly to work through, negotiate, and discuss the best path forward for the city, schools, and community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3123.582s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Considering the financial pressures many of our residents are facing, as well as the need to increase our revenues to account for costs outpacing our 2.5% levy threshold, we have concluded that in November, the voters should decide on if they want to adequately fund our programs, positions, and projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3141.846s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: one on a debt exclusion for a new fire headquarters, and two Proposition 2 1⁄2 overrides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3147.609s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The first override question would ask voters to approve raising $3.5 million to stabilize Medford Public Schools funding, including but not limited to funding costs such as teachers, literacy coaches, behavioral specialists, administrative assistants, nurses, and for regular facilities maintenance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3166.055s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And for our Department of Public Works, 500,000 for additional staff for road and sidewalk infrastructure repairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3173.617s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The second override question would ask voters to approve raising 4 million to invest in Medford Public Schools to create a high school schedule that increases access to arts and vocational programming, expands classroom instructional opportunities, and for classroom teacher and paraprofessional compensation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3191.087s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The debt exclusion question would ask voters to approve funding of a bond of up to 30 million to be issued for the design and construction of a new Medford Fire Department headquarters at 120 Main Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3202.952s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The expected cost of these three combined questions would increase property taxes for the average single family home, which is assessed at about $770,000 by approximately $446 per year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3211.716s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That would be about $37 per month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3219.991s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: But since our schools need to be right-sized now, I've asked your body to approve an amendment to the budget to increase the school's budget allocation from 76 million to 77.75 million through the use of 1.75 million in one-time funding advance, 500,000 of which will fund the purchase of Chromebooks and laptops and begins an annual refresh cycle to maintain our district-wide technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3245.629s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Now this is one-time funding, so if the first override question does not pass, then we will be right back here in the same position next year with cuts on the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3255.097s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: But passing these overrides is by no means an easy decision, and I recognize that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3260.601s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: In fact, coming to these numbers was a painstaking process, and I'm still wary of the financial burden increased taxes may have in our community, especially in those struggling to get by, and that weighs heavily on me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3275.273s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Ultimately, I believe the question of pass would fulfill our greatest needs, mainly in our schools and for our children, but also help make progress on the number one complaint we get, which is the conditions of our roads and sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3288.378s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I know this is the right decision because the alternative will mean more cuts and more challenges for our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3293.519s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And in my opinion, we cannot afford to continue on that path.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3297.741s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Our residents deserve the right to take a vote on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3302.213s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: This is a big decision that requires considerable thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3305.215s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I truly believe, however, that approving these ballot questions is the right thing, and I hope the majority of the community agrees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3312.059s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: There are, of course, other aspects to this budget than just the Proposition 2 1⁄2 override questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3319.366s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: many of which are quite encouraging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3321.487s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We are making significant investment in several core city systems, maintaining as much service as possible and providing a sustainable roadmap for future big ticket expenditures, like a new fire headquarters and a new Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3336.19s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We're making another significant investment in our library, increasing its budget by nearly 12%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3342.574s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: This coupled with last year's increase of about 18% has resulted in a more than doubling effect on the city's library budget in the last decade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3351.621s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: This has allowed everyone in our community to get better access to the resources and programs that our fabulous library offers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3358.367s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We're increasing the budget for our department of public works to keep up with increased costs in services, as well as give us some flexibility as we continue to address the backlog of stumps, tree pruning, repairs,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3370.157s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: et cetera, to update our aging water infrastructure and improve accessibility and pedestrian mobility in our squares and green spaces and throughout our entire community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3380.142s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The city continues to work towards goals laid out in our Climate Action and Adaptation Plan, which was finalized in fiscal year 23.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3388.12s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: My administration is committed to removing barriers that would preclude residents from sustainable practices, including financial barriers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3395.381s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The city has partnered with Garbage to Garden to launch a free municipal curbside composting program for eligible residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3402.163s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: This program launches in fiscal year 25, which is July 1st, 2024, and aims to be widely accessible and convenient, making it easy for residents to participate in creating a greener, more sustainable future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3415.882s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The city has also received 300,000 in grant funding to expand public outreach and strengthen support specifically for underrepresented and underserved communities interested in decarbonizing their homes and vehicles through energy efficiency, solar, and electricification of heating, water heating appliances, and electric vehicles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3436.392s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: This program, Electrify Medford, will seek to educate residents on available resources and help them make these changes in their own homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3444.662s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: As part of our commitment to residents, we are always looking for ways to expand diversity, equity, and inclusion throughout the city and create an environment of belonging for our entire community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3456.332s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Our DEI director has been working with our human resource director to update best practices for recruiting, interviewing, and hiring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3464.585s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Due to this work, the city has been able to recruit, hire, and retain diverse candidates for a variety of city positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3471.113s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: This team also hosts trainings and other professional development opportunities to ensure employees have all the tools they need to uphold our values and mission, something that will be enhanced and continued through fiscal year 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3484.104s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We have secured $850,000 to help transform the Dorothy T. Hegner Center into a municipal vulnerability preparedness site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3492.489s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The Hegner Center will be renovated into a community space that will be used to coordinate emergency responses and will serve as a resiliency hub for residents during climate emergencies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3502.554s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The site will also host an afterschool program through the city's rec department and other community oriented events when not being used for emergencies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3511.604s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Last year, our engineering team got to work on repairing approximately 90 roads that have been identified as prime candidates for crack sailing in the pavement report from 2021 and the updated report from 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3525.387s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The city will deploy over 180,000 in ARPA funding to crack sail the additional streets on the list for the next several years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3532.329s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Crack sailing is a preventative measure that prolongs the life of roads and avoids having to make major structural repairs in the near future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3539.844s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The engineering division has also identified six roads that are among the most in need and are working through planning process with our administration with the hope of repaving the season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3549.514s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Our infrastructure needs reach beyond our streets, thoroughways and pedestrian paths.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3556.365s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: A major component of the work being done by our DPW team is the ongoing water meter system replacement project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3562.787s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Initiated in fiscal year 24, the team in the water and sewer division is continuing to install new state-of-the-art systems in homes across the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3571.03s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: These meters are a crucial step in addressing the aging water infrastructure, delivering accurate readings for customers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3578.993s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's also evident that our water and sewer infrastructure is aging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3583.035s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The system dates back<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3584.457s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: decades and after years of neglect to properly repair or place pipes, we are now in the process of devising a comprehensive strategy that will begin to assess the future needs of our system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3595.485s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: This will take years and will be very expensive, but it must be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3600.268s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: In addition to improving our public infrastructure, we're also been working to enhance and upgrade many of our public spaces for the community to utilize and enjoy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3608.993s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Current projects that are nearing completion include Gillis Park and Car Park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3613.499s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Gillis is a 1.4 million renovation project that will upgrade accessibility features, improve the baseball field and add new park amenities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3646.801s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: As I toured the project a couple of weeks ago, I was in awe of how wonderful the space will be for everyone in our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3654.099s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's no secret that one of the key measures of our financial health is the revenue we generate from commercial development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3660.024s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: While it's important that we expand our tax base in this sector, we must also consider the enormous barriers, both structurally and financially, for families, workers, and individuals attempting to find meaningful and sustainable housing in our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3675.114s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We are bringing over 500 new residential units to the community through eight new developments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3680.698s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: To further support the housing crisis that is affecting nearly every municipality, we have allocated nearly 400,000 in funds from ARPA to offset permitting costs of renovations and upgrades to current and new affordable housing units at the housing authority as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3696.22s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Through successful negotiations, we've gained leverage with our 40B developers to bring more community benefits to the planning process, like better pedestrian accessibility, reduction of potential traffic congestion, more open space, more access to public transportation, and more affordable housing units were the priority for Medford residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3716.311s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: A lot of this hard work on the housing development side is thanks to the work of this Medford City Council and your push for zoning rethought codification, as well as establishing affordable housing trust, which will use various funding streams to help facilitate more affordable units coming to market.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3732.436s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Your honorable body in collaboration with our planning development and sustainability office are now working on the next phase of the zoning process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3741.462s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Before I conclude, I want to highlight a few other projects and programs that our staff has worked so hard to bring to life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3873.451s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: As I'm sure you know, this is just a brief overview of all the work that everyone has done over the last year and the investments we've made that will help build on the vision we share for our city's future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3883.203s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We have worked in tandem on a variety of critical issues, be it zoning reform, the housing production plan, or the capital improvement plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3890.866s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I wanna thank the city council for being a thoughtful partner in government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3894.788s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: You all have worked extremely hard over the last year to move forward many key priorities and improve efficiency on a number of fronts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3903.492s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Before you debate the budget, please know I'm here to answer any questions you may have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4618.188s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Well first, I wish I was at the Red Sox game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4627.173s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4629.114s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4632.816s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: If the override, if the first override question, I mentioned it in my presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4638.999s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: If the first override question fails, we will be right back in the same position in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=4651.894s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5413.455s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5414.395s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Um, just a few points from councilor scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5418.756s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: First off is I just want to point out that we do probably twice a year, press releases on development strategy and what our team and PDS has been doing throughout the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5430.759s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The last one was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5433.322s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: late fall, it's on our city website and it outlines all the work that we've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5438.904s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I just wanna point that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5440.885s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We have six housing developments, including 240Bs that are moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5448.328s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We have five life science developments that are moving forward, Riverside Ab, Boston Ab, Sycamore, et cetera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5456.636s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We also have the Great American Beer Hall, commercial, retail, mixed-use developments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5460.979s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: There's another whole list that has been moved forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5464.742s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I think it's a shame to say that we've done nothing in the last few years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5470.506s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So that's always open to the public, and we do send that to every councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5473.528s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I just don't know if everybody reads it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5476.11s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Second, I had a...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5478.652s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: planning department outline, because it's said quite often that we've lost opportunities on these 40 Bs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5487.096s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: First, there's one that keeps submitting and withdrawing, so that is what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5492.579s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We did do our GLAM analysis and we did in-state Safe Harbor<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5499.548s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: there was two developments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5500.849s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: One was Mystic Valley Parkway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5502.01s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That's the one that's moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5504.632s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And then there's a Felsway that's in the middle of, between the Felsway commercial and then a fully residential neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5511.176s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So by instituting Safe Harbor, we've been able to get these developers to come to the table and negotiate with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5520.836s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: If we didn't install our safe harbor status, we would have had no seat at the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5526.584s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We would have been able to get no community benefits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5529.848s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And if you wouldn't indulge me, I'll just maybe I have multiple pages on the first two and I can just.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5536.316s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'll actually read the first one that's moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5538.958s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's 4,000 Mystic Valley Parkway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5540.659s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We've reduced density from the original proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5543.721s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We split it into two buildings for more manageable scale.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5547.884s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We asked them to put in a shared use path around the entire property, not accessible vehicles on two sides, improve amenity space for residents with intentional play areas, significantly improved architectural design,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5561.492s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Up to 70% of the affordable units will have Medford priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5565.876s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Significantly increased bike storage for residents including provisions for electric bike charging in parking areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5572.522s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Pocket Park on the corner of Mystic Valley Parkway and Commercial Street with public amenities including a commitment for public art to be improved by the Medford Arts Council, Medford Historic Society and the Medford Department of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5585.113s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We building an all electric, the building will be all electric with the exception of emergency generator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5591.795s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We've improved the layout for loading and passenger drop-off zones on site on the commercial outside to improve area vehicle flow, significant pedestrian improvements to the intersection of Commercial Ave and Mystic Valley Parkway, including ADA ramps, pedestrian countdown indicators, pedestrian push buttons, improved crosswalk pave markings,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5609.682s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: new streetlights on commercial street, improved curb cuts, sidewalks, and crosswalks on commercial street, a new blue bike station on site or in the vicinity, over 50,000 alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5620.367s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Applicant will comply with the solar ordinance, 264,000 in linkage paid to our fire, police, and parks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5626.609s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That's just one 40B project, and we would have gotten none of this if we didn't instate our, it didn't calculate our glam analysis and didn't instate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5635.563s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: safe harbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5636.164s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I'm so proud of the work that our planning development sustainability office has done on not only this, but also on the Felsway and whatever the last developer chooses to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5646.517s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And then I just want to speak to the task force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5651.243s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I wanna say that this is probably, in my 23 years, it's been the most collaborative that school committee, city council, and the mayor's office has been.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5660.106s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I think I said that to you after the election in November, that I just feel like these three bodies are gonna be able to work better and more collaboratively than they ever have, because you all do the work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5671.89s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Whether people like it or not, whether they think you're moving too fast, you're doing the work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5676.371s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I'm proud of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5677.272s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The school committee is doing the work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5678.993s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'm a witness to it every night that I'm at the meetings and I know what some of the, some or all of the school committee members put together behind the scenes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5688.019s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And this has been transparent since day one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5690.3s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It was 2022 when Councilor Behrs and Councilor Collins discussed it at the council meeting and wrote a public memo that you thought an override should be on the ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5703.576s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I wrote a public memo back that I agreed, 12 million, 3 million, but that's that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5709.68s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And since then, we, yes, we talk on the phone, we talk behind closed doors, but it's all transparent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5716.705s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: When we went through the budget last year, we did, we sat down, we discussed it, just, Councilor Sang, you were also in the room, we discussed it, we said, what's the path forward, how are we gonna manage, how are we gonna build a better budget and a better budget process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5729.354s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And we did a press release, that was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5732.403s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Correct me if I'm wrong on specific dates, but in June of 2023, we put out a press release on exactly what we agreed on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5741.169s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Nothing more, nothing less.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5743.25s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Transparency, that's transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5745.391s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We started a meeting in the fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5746.872s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I believe our first meeting might've been the end of September, beginning of October.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5750.435s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Again, put out another press release.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5753.056s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We then worked through the struggles that we are facing financially over the last several months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5757.728s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Yes, the five of us were in that room for the task force meeting, but member Graham and myself were meeting with the CFO of the schools and our superintendent, quite regularly, as well as the school committee meeting on the floor to talk about the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5771.89s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: myself and my chief of staff, as well as the counselors, I'm sure, we're talking to our CFO, who I also think has an amazing mind, regularly, my chief of staff every day, myself at least weekly, or sometimes multiple times a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5787.633s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So yes, we had two CFOs working on this process, not in the room every step of the way when we met as a group of five, but we talked through what we thought was the best path forward and how we could<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5800.1s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: get this budget approved and still provide for our city and mainly our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5804.682s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I'm proud of the work we've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5806.062s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Gone are the days where we're negotiating jobs for friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5810.964s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That doesn't happen anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5812.445s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We're negotiating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5813.245s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We truly care about this city and we care about the future of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5817.267s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And that's why you have the three ballot questions before you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5819.855s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: People can vote yes, people can vote no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5822.017s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: They're split into three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5823.138s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We could have done two, but I think three was the best way to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5827.202s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: People have a choice, and they have a choice in November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5830.225s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It is months and months away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5831.646s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: There's gonna be campaigns on both sides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5834.189s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: There's gonna be things we're restricted from doing after potentially the vote tonight if it passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5839.16s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: but it's up to the people now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5841.541s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So, I mean, there's more I could go into.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5844.442s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I am listening to residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5846.563s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: This money will not go into a black hole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5848.124s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's gonna go towards literacy coaches.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5850.125s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's gonna go towards a nurse so that he or she is not let go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5854.286s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's gonna go to teachers because we wanna keep the levels as much as we can in our school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5862.95s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's gonna be the best way forward for our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5866.851s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I just wanted to address the councilor, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7379.316s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'll only comment on a few things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7382.358s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I just take sincere offense to say that, for one, to say that things have been mismanaged financially for five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7390.725s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We've had two CFOs in the last five years and they've both done a great job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7394.428s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I just want to comment on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7397.825s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Second, and I know it's been said by my chief of staff a number of times, I have to address the legal costs of the city of Medford, because there is a number of us that sat and we reviewed budgets in 16 different communities, and we were the first or second lowest in legal, paying legal costs, and that includes- If I may.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7421.921s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Excuse me, I have the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7424.514s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That that includes outside legal counsel as well as Coleman and page who we use as the 40 municipal attorneys that specialize in different things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7434.918s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: In comparison, I'll give you one city, Malden, very similar to us, spends about a million point two in legal costs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7441.88s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Medford spends a bit over 400,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7444.381s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think it was 450,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7444.821s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I just want to put that into perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7448.182s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And then the council also mentions cleaning things up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7451.443s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Maybe he's offended by what I've done the last four years, but I've brought accountability to this community and I am so proud of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8022.358s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Yes, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8023.259s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Continue to have discussions with anybody that is willing to call me back and communicate with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4795.265s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Just to piggyback from the chair, if I may, on Member Graham's point, I think we did have discussion on the afterschool programming piece in the past, and I think we all agreed that we were going to try to, this would be a great addition, obviously, for afterschool programming, but also make sure that we don't create more spots for one year and then can't fulfill them the year after is one<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4821.052s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: thing we just want to think through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4822.432s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And then the second is, are we going to be working throughout the summer to increase hiring, especially at three schools where we have the 60 students in the after school program?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4834.357s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Because we did make a recommendation that we try to increase the other three schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4839.679s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I know the Brooks is at over 120.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4840.799s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I just want to make sure that's still in the works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4845.12s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 2020, 2021, 2022, we're hiring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4850.218s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: to hire, I know that, but I'm hoping we make some strides this summer to increase, get some of those children off the wait list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4859.159s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Member Reinfeldt?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4920.404s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That's great, yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4923.266s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And then just the funding source for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4926.609s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: If we had one team, it's $100,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4929.05s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: If we have two teams, it's $200,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5003.424s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Okay, yeah, that makes sense, because we'll be able to hopefully accept more children off the wait list, bringing in more funding to hopefully support at least a portion of this funding need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5015.092s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5016.013s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Is there a motion on the floor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5017.994s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Member Rousseau, then Member Ntapa?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5105.325s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I don't know if anybody has any response to that, but I'll go to Member Russo until<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5353.029s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Maybe you can elaborate then, Dr. Edward-Vincent, on what would the plan be if we had 12 students going into college or in college, and then that allowed us to bring in 100 more children to the afterschool program, what will we do the next year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5373.629s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: how would we explain it to families?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5376.269s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Or are we gonna be trying to hire starting June of 2025 to make sure we can maintain that level?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5678.303s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5679.224s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5680.484s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'm just finished my thought from the chair, and then I'm going to go to Member Bramley and then Member Reinfeld.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5686.406s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think, for me, I'd be a yes, because I think we have an after-school crisis, and I think it seems like a wonderful program, and of course, our teachers can be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5698.373s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: you support, and I think that we could bring in more revenue to be able to support this fee that is gonna be 100,000 for six people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5708.637s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I just know that as a committee, we've been asking for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5711.377s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: you know, several years to increase numbers at our, of the three afterschool programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5715.14s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I don't think we've increased it at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5717.341s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So that makes me concerned what it's either, we don't want to increase it at all, or we really can't, can still not hire to increase at that, those three schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5727.228s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And that would in turn, if it's the hiring piece, that is the issue, whether city is here for one, two or three years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5735.454s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I like that as a continued partnership, I just would have concerns for families just,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5740.589s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: not having that support and creating their lives around an after-school program and then only having it for a year or maybe two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5748.735s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So that's just a concern I have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5750.896s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: But member Brandley and member Reichelt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6871.912s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I thought that was real call, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6904.028s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: section 37 M a notwithstanding the provisions of chapter 41 or chapter 71 or any other special general law to the contrary any city or town which accepts this provision of the section may consolidate administrative functions including but not limited to financial personnel and maintenance functions of the school committee with those of the city or town provided however that such consolidation may occur only upon a majority vote of both the school committee and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6931.471s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: in the city, the city council with approval of the mayor required by law or in a town, the annual town meeting or in a town with no town meeting, the town council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6941.158s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: B, notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, decision to consolidate functions pursuant to paragraph A of this section may be revoked by a majority vote of either the school committee of the city or town or the city of town or both as such vote is described in said paragraph A. I put this before you,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6963.16s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: is it was something that's been talked about from when I was a city councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6967.521s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I believe the conversation started in the 2018 timeframe and it never fully moved forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6976.003s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So this is the way you have to accept it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6978.823s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Although, you know, I am happy to come before you with any, or I'm sure the school administration is as well with any specific requests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6987.722s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: First and foremost, I think this will help a great deal with facilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6992.143s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We want a big goal of mine, and I know it's part of the committee's goals, is to get routine maintenance in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7000.125s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We hope to have more funding soon to be able to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7004.387s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I think this, along with all the work that the negotiation team did,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7009.983s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: would go a very long way and make that happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7013.146s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So we have contracts set up and running to maintain our not-so-new schools anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7017.71s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So just ask for your approval on this paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7020.392s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We will keep you up to date on anything moving forward and happy to request a vote if need be, but definitely we'll keep you updated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7033.523s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Member Rousseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7065.814s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: No, I understood it that once you accept this, it can be done, but it would have to come before the school committee for any type of budgetary vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7072.962s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So if this money is coming out of school monies, then yes, you'd have to vote for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7077.626s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'm not sure the city council would as well, unless it was coming out of city funding, then yes, it would have to be part of a budget or a supplemental budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7114.71s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I would expect tomorrow night that I would hope that they would approve this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7118.054s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I would expect to be paper that it would just be for facilities for now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7123.499s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And then we'd have to go before and this body can do the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7126.883s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And then if we wanna expand that, we can always take another vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7205.258s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That may be how some cities and towns handle it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7208.221s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I do not see that it would operate that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7211.964s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So for example, if you were gonna put<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7214.085s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: IT under one director fully, and then if you're going to say, yeah, do it with IT, I could see that being the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7223.091s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: But where we have a facilities maintenance director in the schools, we would just be putting somebody in charge to oversee, to help guide, to put the appropriate contracts into place, to help create a system and help<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7239.099s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: train and get that job done, especially if we're going to have an influx of potential monies that we want to be spent towards maintaining our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7247.605s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's a lot for one person to handle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7249.847s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And that person also oversees all the custodial work, from what I understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7254.89s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I feel like this would be an extra support and another level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7259.794s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I see it a little bit differently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7292.175s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Yeah, in this one case, I would,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7295.609s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: see that this director of facilities would still be a direct report to the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7301.876s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: If there's somebody overseeing that work, that could also be a second direct report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7309.464s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7394.947s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think that's absolutely fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7398.609s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It just has to be a B paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7400.169s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: From what I understand, this language has to be adopted as is, but you can absolutely do a B paper to make those restrictions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7455.916s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: and that would allow us to know this, in general, this is supported, especially with, say, facilities, and allow us to build that plan to bring to the school committee for approval or denial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7492.109s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7492.369s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That's my motion motion for approval of the main paper and B paper by member Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6919.752s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Because report on operations, I don't think covers it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6922.553s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That's just my opinion from the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6924.713s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Member Rousseau, and then, oh, I'm sorry, I don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7035.7s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So motion to table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7041.263s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I don't even, it's not even on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7043.565s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So there's, I can withdraw it and maybe withdraw it and then just make sure it's very transparent on the, on the agenda for our next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7050.489s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That would be very appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7325.866s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And while you're looking for your next item, maybe a thought process before the next meeting on the parking spot issue is teens, high school students paying for a spot so they can decorate and have their own.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7341.091s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7341.931s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Just to think a little bit more creatively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7346.873s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: On to the next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7574.25s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: through the chair did they say how long it's going to take to train that they're in bus drivers are in training do they say how long it's going to take for medford to get two more<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7703.049s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And then just thank you, Dr. Edward Vincent, just to follow up the training that the current personnel are in now, is that a two week training?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7711.049s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Is that a four week training?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7772.014s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: if somebody wants to make a motion, I think since we're not paying for the two buses that we budgeted for, as we hear of overcrowding issues, because like Dr. Cushing said, we're not gonna make kids walk home in a dangerous situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7788.877s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Can we make sure that there's a monitor on those buses with that funding until these two additional ones come online so that we don't have any, so nobody gets hurt and there's no liability on the city and schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7881.13s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=847.144s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you, President Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=848.445s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I want to thank Councilor Marks for putting this on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=851.306s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Councilor Caravaglio, Marks, and I were at that meeting, the police meeting, community meeting, and we spoke an hour, you know, we got updates on the South Medford shooting,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=863.103s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The next most spoken about subject was the graffiti and how it's an eyesore, how Somerville is getting tough on their graffiti.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=871.89s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So it's bringing more down, especially in the South Medford area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=875.453s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: But there's people also complaining about it in West Medford, in Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=880.797s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It is everywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=881.578s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I mean, people are tagging for fun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=883.539s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: People are tagging to break the rules, break the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=887.543s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I think if Somerville's getting tough on it, I think it's time Medford does too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=893.322s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: put on the agenda and try to get certain spots cleaned up, but I think an ordinance creating a revolving account is a great way to do it, so I thank Councillor Marks for putting this on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=907.012s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I definitely am in favour of the paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=908.993s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think we need to stop the repeat tagging and just the fact that it's everywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=916.719s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think we should spend a portion of the money that comes into the revolving account, not only to clean up the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=923.561s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: like we spoke about last week, on cameras so that we can catch these offenders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=928.442s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We can catch them, we can find them, and we can make that revolving account, clean up all the graffiti within our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=935.164s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I would hope that some of that money would go to be spent on cameras.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=939.826s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I also wanted to just, Councilman Marks brought up Citizen Connect smartphone, and I know it goes along with the 311 system that Somerville uses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=950.329s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I happen to be in Somerville today, and they are giving out magnets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=954.295s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: with regards to if it's not an emergency and you need us or any other city service, you call 311.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=960.058s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I brought this up maybe four or five months ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=963.759s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We voted 7-0 to get this installed in Medford, this program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=969.542s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It will provide accountability and it's something that our residents deserve because I'm sure we're all sick of saying, hearing, when is my sidewalk gonna get fixed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=979.427s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: When is my street pothole gonna be repaved?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=982.327s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: all the DPW, you know, they'll say it's going to be done, or you're on the list, especially with sidewalk repairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=989.651s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: You're on the list, you're on the list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=991.392s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We really don't know what happens with that list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=993.793s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: This is a way for accountability, for response, and for action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=998.075s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So again, I'm going to see if I can amend your paper council marks and again vote that City of Medford implement the 311 program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1006.36s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think it's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1007.856s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: an absolute great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1009.616s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I've spoken to people in the building department at the city of Somerville, and they don't know what they would do without it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1016.278s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I think it's time for Medford to become accountable for all the complaints that come in, issues and concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1023.479s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So thank you again, Councilor Marks, and I'd like to amend the paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1027.12s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4499.38s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you, President Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4500.901s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I echo the sentiment of my councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4503.063s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I believe a dog park, and I've said it before, is needed in this community, especially since we've raised money and had fundraisers for it, and there's money sitting there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4512.812s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I did have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4513.813s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I know that there's petitions going around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4516.175s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I saw that SMARTO, the South Medford<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4519.8s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: neighborhood group has sent petitions out, so I ask Councillor Marks, are they going to be in any businesses?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4524.442s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Where can people go to sign a petition?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4527.003s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Maybe we should, I know you're working on the petition, but how can people get out that you really don't know, aren't in the SMARTO email list?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4537.086s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: How can we get the people out to sign petitions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4539.367s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: This is a good question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8335.446s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Gene, I agree with you on the community policing and getting back to the community policing, which we used to do years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8342.911s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I agree with you on that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8344.232s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I know that the chief of police is going to have the first walk in South Medford with the neighbors sometime, I think, late next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8353.174s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: council recommendation and that's a start and hopefully he does that within the different neighborhoods in the community as a start back to going back to community policing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8656.981s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I know I got complaints about Tamponi Manor not having FIOS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8660.624s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So we did receive a resolve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8662.645s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I know two people that did complain to me, watched the council meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8670.157s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: From John Coddington, Medford Housing Authority to the Mayor's Office, who thankfully forwarded to us the email reads, I was recently approached by the firm hired by Verizon and charged with wiring the city for Fios.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8684.031s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: He sent us some material and I had staff meet with him yesterday about the possibility of wiring our nine MHA public housing sites.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8693.57s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We, as in John Coddington, now plan to visit the Malden Housing Authority to see the quality of their installation work and to talk with them about their experience with the whole process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8703.133s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: If things look acceptable, the next step would be to have the engineers come up with a scope of work and a plan for wiring our 845 apartments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8712.537s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: They indicated they would like everything worked out by the end of the year, so the actual site work could be completed in 2015.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8719.639s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'm thinking we'll know more within the next four to six weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8722.54s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I hope this information helps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8724.36s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So the 845 units within the Medford Housing Authority, just wanna confirm that Verizon, hopefully Verizon will be installed in 2015 and Mr. Coddington is working on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8736.644s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I thank the mayor's office again for getting us a response on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1758.397s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think the city does one or two locations in each school per year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1767.205s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So nothing extensive like what Water Smart has done for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1837.337s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So yes, anything our water department Mr Sousa, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2077.941s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: If I may, from the chair, I think the slide was, I think it was a third or fourth slide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2083.526s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It showed that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2102.009s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: facilities and grounds director from the city was notified of this probably beginning of last week, the week before, and immediately took action to start testing the fixtures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2114.755s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So we've got replacement fixtures, and we're going to be retesting those locations that we're going to test out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2121.039s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So we don't know the cause of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=680.84s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I don't know how much more you want to hear from me, but I'm sure there will be a number of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=684.863s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'm here to support loud questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=688.246s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think question six and question seven are the most important to me to raise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=695.593s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We've been working on a new environment for us for years, and I think it's essential that we now is the time to be able to go to the final design, go to bid, and construct that new building for our staff and our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=712.606s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And question seven especially,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=716.108s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I've done a video, I've done four videos, they're all on social media, and then I'll be more lengthy than I'll speak tonight, but question seven, 500,000, and that is to hire a completely separate DPW crew who can just work on our streets and our sidewalks, fill potholes, patchwork, and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=737.526s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Perhaps seal our roads, which Councilor Calderon mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=740.807s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Let's do the preventive maintenance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=742.888s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And we are actively trying to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=744.789s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We have an amazing DPW director, an amazing city engineer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=749.051s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: They are working so hard with the funding and manpower.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=752.552s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's just not fully there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=755.213s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So to have a center through,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=757.034s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: to tackle one of the largest issues that I hear about all the time, my street, my sidewalk, it's unsafe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=763.959s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I just busted a tire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=765.701s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: To be able to do that and to put $500,004 just to get back down to the city is essential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=772.706s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Schools, whether it's two, three, four, $500,004 just to put towards preventive maintenance and maintenance that we should already be doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=783.494s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We just don't have the funding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=785.555s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And we finally now have somebody on the city side for the first time ever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=790.406s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's our first facilities maintenance director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=793.372s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: He's actually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=795.015s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: involved in the school department, banks, and so has our director of planning and development and sustainability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=802.177s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: They're helping the schools make sure that we are getting work done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=806.559s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Biggest for me is we made sure this year that our security cameras are all functioning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=812.341s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We made sure that all of the door locks have been changed, so now we know who has<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=817.406s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We had lights that were running out, there was no lighting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=821.79s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: These are the projects that we are working on to maintain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=834.961s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And we've never had, it's like we do now on the city side, but on the school side, we still don't have those routine maintenance yearly checks, write-in checks of our systems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=848.044s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We've let our HR get so bad in the last 20 years on our political school loan that it's costing us over a million dollars for an OPM and architect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=858.907s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And it's almost $20 million to get AC and HVAC just to those two schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=864.03s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: They were built at the same time as our other non-federal schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=869.953s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That's just the HVAC, VRM, et cetera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=873.835s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So to be able to put in several hundred thousand dollars to do routine maintenance and annual maintenance of our schools is essential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=882.739s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We need to do it to prevent the bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=885.22s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We can't let that, we can't go on like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=889.606s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We just can't, especially when we have residents who are saying, please help fund our school, fund our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=900.519s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: and putting it to a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=901.48s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: You know, there are people that I know can't afford it, and I've said in my videos, and I'll say tonight, there are exceptions out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=908.104s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Our assessors have an online paper copies in our assessor's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=912.687s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We have a calculator on our city website that will tell you how this will affect you and what options there are for you if there are exemptions and exclusions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=921.792s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So there are ways, and the biggest part of that question seven is current personnel in our State Department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=930.538s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Now we did, we'll say do the hard work, you're not managing right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=933.542s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Remember Graham and I, and the school committee, and the superintendent, and our finance staff, we did the hard, we did some very hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=941.433s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We got two to three million dollars from our school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=946.48s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We want the taxpayers to let us know, do you want us to do it again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=949.941s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Because we're going to have to cut at least $2 million in staff on the school side, but it's also going to take things up on the city side, because I prioritize our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=960.505s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And there are going to be some tough budget meetings moving forward if question seven doesn't pass, because I'll be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=968.042s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I mean, we're talking meetings going over budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=973.065s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's like, please level the bottom as much as you can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=977.428s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We're already talking about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=984.632s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's not mismanagement, it's the fact that school costs, which is the largest piece of this puzzle, is up at least 8% across the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1003.24s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We can't cut homeless transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1005.222s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That's about $500,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1005.622s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Jenny probably knows the numbers better than I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1009.146s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We cannot cut certain things that are essential in our school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1013.711s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Homeless transportation, transportation, special ed costs, they can't be cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1017.896s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So our cuts are coming from people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1019.177s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Our cuts are going straight to the classroom, straight to the mental health supports, the guidance counselors, people that are needed for our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1026.044s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Since COVID it's been extremely tough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1028.707s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Our children are struggling and knowing that we did the hard work and we made the adjustments and we changed what I felt needed to be changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1037.735s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I worked with the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1038.996s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I worked with the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1040.517s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We passed a budget and we came up with this plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1043.34s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We worked together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1044.441s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's been very, very transparent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1047.163s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Everything we've done, we've laid out in press releases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1049.264s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think there's about four up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1051.306s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We're doing videos.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1052.287s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We're speaking publicly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1053.868s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It is all transparent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1055.049s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We want you to have the right to vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1057.911s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Yes or no?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1059.072s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I had one of those questions split, because I do know there's some people that can't afford it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1064.595s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So question six is in required headquarters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1068.557s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That's a debt exclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1070.158s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Once that debt's paid off, that will fall off your due taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1073.941s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So yes, it passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1075.682s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Question seven, you spoke about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1077.703s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And then question eight, I too would love to be able to work towards our goals, which was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1085.107s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: better high school and vocational schedule and get our children in the classroom a little longer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1089.27s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Now that needs to be negotiated, so we won't go into depth about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1092.833s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That will happen at the negotiation table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1095.355s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Without that funding, that won't be possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1098.237s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That will not be possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1099.638s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So now's the time for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1102.34s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Some cities and towns do overrides quite often.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1105.281s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We've never done it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1107.741s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: In support of these override questions, I'll be voting yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1110.382s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I just ask that you do your homework.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1111.902s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I ask that you keep an open mind and really just think about it, especially how it will affect you and your family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1121.584s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I understand that this is both of the people of my burden.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1125.845s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I hope they're successful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1346.541s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Now, to therefore, what does that mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1351.484s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1352.605s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Like I said, I've done a pre-cash video, and then on the city side, we just put out a diagram of city needs, what would that be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1361.694s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 100% open spend of free cash on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1364.055s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It just outlines the needs in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1366.916s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We have over 100 million in backlog on our streets and sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1372.138s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We're putting out a press release this week with regards to 10,000 homes that will get a letter in November letting them know they either have landlines into their home or that they're an unknown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1388.806s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That's going to be upwards of a hundred plus million dollars for the city to fix those lead mines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1396.212s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So there you have over $200,000 million, $200 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1401.556s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Then you also have a large issue with water and sewer infrastructure,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1408.681s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: put in over 420 years ago, that is probably several hundred million dollars to do our water and sewer infrastructure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1417.528s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So between the lead that needs to be, the new federal guidelines say we need to take care of this lead line issue over the next eight to ten years, we have to fix our streets and sidewalks, and we have to fix our water and sewer infrastructure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1432.139s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That alone is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1434.043s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: $400 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1435.665s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Then we have in the pocket, right here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1441.269s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: several million in different buckets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1443.19s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: One, like Councilor Callahan said, is five million into a stabilization account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1447.752s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That is our emergency fund, and that is important to have in case some large project, like a new roof, needs to get done anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1457.577s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Then we put, that included, we put six million into that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1460.378s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Five million went into a capital improvement stabilization account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1464.34s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So that was five million, it was our first,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1468.095s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: First stabilization comes ever, and as of July 1st, we either had projects go over in cost, or we've had emergencies of about $1.2 million, just from July 1st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1483.065s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That includes the Brooks School hot water heater, the blue, that was a couple hundred thousand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1490.57s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We had,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1492.991s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So that was a water feeder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1495.332s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We had road safety, traffic safety improvements at Central and Spring Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1500.075s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That project was over $250,000 that we needed to spend money on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1505.517s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Today, there was another request for a grant match, for an MVP grant match of $35,000, and the list goes on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1513.341s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So in just a matter of a few months, we needed to spend $1.1 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1518.244s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That account is down to $3.9.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1520.945s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And that just goes to show the emergencies and the overages and the cost of things that we need to get done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1526.829s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We have a capital improvement plan that you can also access on our website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1530.871s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That has us spending millions of dollars a year just on equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1535.914s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: DBW, police cruisers, fire trucks, and the list goes on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1542.498s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So please take a look at our capital improvement plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1545.04s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's a six-year plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1546.921s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We've, Collin Center helped us with that plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1551.089s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: the most professional planning efforts ever had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1553.352s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So we had one that was done in 2021, and we just re-updated it two years later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1560.219s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So that's on our website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1712.436s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1713.156s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We averaged over the last couple decades, we've averaged anywhere from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1719.371s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: one to one and a half million in new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1722.994s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: This past fiscal year, we brought that up, that number up to 2.5 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1727.937s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So we are growing in new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1731.36s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We've doubled the size of our planning department, thankfully, which is planning, development, and sustainability, and we have our first ever economic development director who's trying to bring in new business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1742.968s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And we've been working extremely hard on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1746.19s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: a number of projects that are in the works, and a number of projects that are coming in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1751.413s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So, we are doing well with regrowth, but we're always looking to expand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1755.435s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think we've, you should correct me if I'm wrong, but we had<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1761.308s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: five or six life science facilities that were ready to move forward, and that market kind of fell apart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1770.615s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I started asking developers to bring life science to Medford right when I became mayor in 2020, and at that time it was too late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1779.942s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So we are,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1781.523s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We're trying to get the tech industry, we're trying to get multi, we just put an RFP out for our three lots in Medford Square, that's gonna be mixed use, affordable housing, commercial, so we are doing everything we can, we're gonna have the space above the well into the air rights, and we're moving, but it just takes time, so you see a lot of development now, but you see more and more as the years go by.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2007.386s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: it was likely to be a 30-year loan for $30 million to build a new high school, and that wouldn't hit, fire station, I'm sorry, fire station, and that wouldn't hit our tax rolls this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2021.029s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That would be next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2024.589s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: In debt exclusion, yes, we're asking for 30 million for a new headquarters, and the question was the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2048.573s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2048.973s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Back when I was on the city council, there was a proposal that was put before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2053.236s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It was actually no community involvement, no involvement from anybody that I'm aware of except the chief of police at the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2060.061s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And it was just put before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2061.662s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It was a design of a new police headquarters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2065.425s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And at the time, as a city councilor, I just asked that we take<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2068.8s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: a couple months to explore a combined station, a fire and a police station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2073.742s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Combined station would save us money in the long run.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2076.703s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That didn't happen, so once I became mayor, obviously as I was campaigning, I made it a central issue to make sure that we also take a look at our fire headquarters and all of our fire buildings, there's six of them, and we put the work in that needs to be put in to make the living environment and the work environment a better place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2097.512s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So since that time, I commissioned a task force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2101.113s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We have put millions of dollars into the five substations, windows, roofs, new kitchens, and the list goes on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2109.336s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I also tasked my chief of staff, who is my trade and engineer, to lead that project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2116.739s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So she's been working on the EnviroHeadquarters for about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2120.9s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: over two years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2122.541s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I've kind of taken a step back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2124.723s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I have other things to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2125.703s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: There's a long list, so we divide and conquer, but she led that chapter with the prior fire chief and the current fire chief, and we've created a plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2136.791s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Right now, it's still in concept design.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2138.532s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's hopefully going into final design, especially if this vote passes, and we're working towards it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2149.36s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: for a building that's 70 years old that needs a lot of work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2153.702s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's the same problems that we have in the police station from ventilation to rodents to windows that need to be replaced and living quarters that need to be better maintained and updated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2169.904s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And the list goes on, and it's an old building, and our department and our city deserves better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2175.732s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So it's debt exclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2177.634s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We chose to go debt exclusion because you can bond multiple ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2182.28s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: One is through debt exclusion, and that is the extra tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2185.724s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Or you can put it on the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2189.506s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: You can put the debt on the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2192.527s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: But in my mind, if you're paying hundreds of thousands of dollars on your bond each year for our headquarters that we could have a debt exclusion on, in my mind, you're taking money away from our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2203.913s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And we just can't afford that right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2206.894s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We haven't been able to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2208.275s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I think this is the much better route.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2211.577s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So what will happen if this doesn't pass?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2214.58s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: They don't know how long we would build.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2471.383s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2472.343s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'll just get into the last piece a bit because although<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2477.381s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'm one member of the school committee, and Member Graham's one member, it's seven members have to vote on something, and the superintendent and the finance director create the budget, obviously with our help and advice and discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2491.533s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We're pretty clear, this is two million, question seven is two million in personnel, it's Chromebooks for our students, it's maintenance for our buildings, and it's a DPW crew.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2503.678s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Now, will the superintendent want to take $50,000 from the maintenance to help with busing or special ed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2512.141s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That's going to be, obviously, the prerogative of the superintendent and finance director, but we are not going to go cut positions to fund something else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2521.203s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We're being as clear as possible, knowing that, obviously, things will live.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2526.885s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And with question eight, it's going to cost at least that or more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2531.047s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: to extend the school day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2532.688s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We're not spending it another way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2534.65s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And the debt exclusion is the debt exclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2537.232s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I don't buy the argument that we're just going to go into the general fund and we're going to spend it on X, Y, and Z. We work very hard, member Graham and I, and Councilor Callahan as well, to balance the budget, to know the needs,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2553.999s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: You know, that's what the taxpayers want us to do, and we do it every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2558.18s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Now, we don't have full control of the schools, but we spend a lot of time, we spend a lot of time on that area, and I'm doing it on the city side, and it's the first time the city's had human resources in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2570.103s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: There was no human resources in the city of Medford until four years ago when I became mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2574.764s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So, holding people accountable, making sure your tax dollars are spent the right way, we're doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2579.865s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's not perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2580.845s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: believe me, I'm starting to look at the parking revenue, I'm looking at overtime, I'm looking at sick time, I'm doing it every day, and so is in Denver right now, both of us on the school side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2592.491s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So this money is going to our children, one way or another, it's our priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3201.049s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We have an application in for the EAP for lead pipe repair, but we don't have, we don't know if we'll get that for another month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3215.699s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's not guaranteed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3216.76s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Yeah, the EAP grant is, we don't know yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3219.482s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It will be another month, and if we do get the grant, it will be, well, one-sixth of the need, or just above lead issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3225.786s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Okay, so just so fan-day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3229.667s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3230.788s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's a substantial amount of money, but when you're talking 100 plus million dollars in replacement that we need to do, the 20 million grant that we applied for through the EPA, we'll just touch a fraction of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3243.457s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3835.373s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: What is set is a piece of land that we have to build the fire station on, which is a very difficult piece of property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3843.256s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's configured in a way, especially the curb cuts and the structure of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3850.078s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think what is set is a 22,000 or so square foot building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3856.499s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We're trying to do 20 to 25,000 construction costs, and then obviously we need<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3861.872s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: contingencies and additional funding for it to get finalized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3867.634s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: What is also set is that we heard from the department and we heard from the current fire chief the position of the building, and that is not how other department heads of the city felt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3881.059s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It was a position where I was left, and I told you I stayed out of the process, but it was a position where I said, okay, traffic and transportation wants this,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3890.816s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: planning, things that should go with this, engineering, DPW, they were all involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3895.278s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And our fire chief said, actually for our department and our members, and the safety of exiting that parcel, this is the way the building needs to be positioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3906.624s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And that's when I took a stand and said, we're gonna do what the fire department wants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3911.467s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'm sorry to those department heads that weren't happy with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3914.568s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: But those are the things that are definite.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3916.73s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Now it's a concept design, so things can definitely be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3919.631s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: be tweaked and changed just like we've done over the last several months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3922.778s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We've added more storage space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3924.702s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We've changed bunk space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3926.786s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I did put a training tower in the design because I've heard loud and clear that the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3931.727s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: training tower was a request of our department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3935.249s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That was put in writing that the union would like to take that out in return for more bunk space, so we took the tower out, there's more bunk space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3944.772s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It is not perfect, I'm not 100% happy, our planning director is not 100% happy, fire chief's not 100% happy, the list goes on, but it's gonna be a brand new building for our department, and final design will come after this building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4330.353s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We do have a lot of supports for those who are struggling to pay rent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4335.154s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Most of that is funded through our community development block grant funding, our CPA funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4340.355s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We did a round of funding to non-profits with our federal funds, APA money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4346.016s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I think that is the avenue, more so than free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4352.977s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I don't know if I was able to discuss it, but a number of different funding sources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4556.658s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We actually, the law says what we can and cannot spend public funds on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4561.799s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So we do have a webpage that outlines this quite a bit, but anything public safety related especially, we can use public funds on private and public ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4571.542s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So we do fill potholes, for instance, or tree branches that are in the middle of any public or private way, we'll get taken care of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4581.724s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Since Tim came on board and Owen came on board, we do follow the laws as it relates to private and public ways, and it is very frustrating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5258.364s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,<br><br>
