    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=729.367s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I just want to, my point of view is I think the city is doing a good thing with the push of this council and Council Marks putting in the thermoplastic sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=738.829s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I know we're doing a pilot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=740.089s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We are doing a pilot program for three crosswalks in the city that should be done within the next<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=745.785s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think it was four or five months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=747.805s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I think we are moving in a step in the right direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=750.786s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: If that works, I do agree that we should do many more throughout our community at a rate that we can afford, whether it's five or six per year, however much it costs, that we are able just to afford being able to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=764.529s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: But I think it is a way to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=766.129s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I mean, the paint, I agree, lasts not even a full season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=770.811s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And we makes it through to the beginning of fall and it's just not effective for the rest of the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=776.934s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So that is a way to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=777.955s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I just want to make sure that we see how the pilot program goes and do it in stages so that we can afford it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4409.789s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you, President Mayocko.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4411.53s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: My issue comes just with financial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4414.131s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Not only we have the budget coming up, but the number of bonds that are on the books.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4419.813s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Currently, I'd like to see a breakdown of—we've got breakdowns before, but I'd like to see a breakdown of what is owed, what will be owed each year for each bond, a total of what is owed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4431.602s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'd also like, for what we currently have, and then on a second spreadsheet, a breakdown of not only what is currently owed, but also an estimate on what the DPW department to rebuild is going to cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4445.553s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'd like that added to the bond worksheet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4449.631s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: as well as we need an update on what's going on with the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4453.854s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We basically, you know, I believe it needs to be expanded on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4458.858s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I don't think evidence being housed in a garage is sufficient, adequate, or reasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4465.423s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think we need to expand on the police department, but we need to know what the mayor and the city administration is gonna do, whether it's, I don't think it's gonna be rebuilt, but whether it be expand,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4479.304s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: rework, refurbish what we need to do at the police station, I'd like that included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4485.168s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'd also like, now we have a three point, I believe it's a $3.3 million bond that they want to put on the books for the pool at 3%, so that's gonna be a good amount, I'd say 80 to $100,000 a year that we're gonna have to pay back per year on the pool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4506.109s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I'd just like to see the figures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4507.75s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: What are we putting on the books?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4508.991s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: What are we going to have to pay back from now until the next 15 years?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4512.974s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We need to be able to evaluate that along with the next budget before we can make the decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4520.26s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I mean, everybody wants to see a brand new pool, brand new locker rooms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4523.563s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I am one of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4525.024s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: But at the same time, we have the rate payers who are basically screaming to us, what are you doing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4530.448s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: How much money can you spend over a three-year period?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4533.325s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: and we have essentials that need to get done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4535.406s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We do not have a DPW yard now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4537.468s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It has to be rebuilt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4539.089s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We had to do what we had to do with the police station, and we have to continue to figure out what the mayor wants to do with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4546.293s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We need to be able to evaluate it all before we can make a recommendation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4549.535s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'd like to ask for it by next Tuesday, because I know we're in line to get about $500,000 to go toward the $600,000 for the locker rooms of the pool, and time is of the essence for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4563.558s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: But if so, if we could get this breakdown, hopefully within the next week, it would be appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4568.081s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It would help me make a determination, um, not only for the students and those who use the pool, but for the, the community as a whole to, to move forward most appropriately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4840.502s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Just to further amend it to include, um, a lift to the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4845.876s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: above ground spectator, um, room to, to investigate the cost of, uh, they said about 30,000 to put in a lift.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=4862.701s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7739.387s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: To the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7743.188s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Clerk Finn, were you able to go to the location?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LlmLze0ItRE&t=7985.142s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Liability insurance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=403.9s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you, President Carviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=407.572s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: My attention was drawn to an article that was in the transcript last week by a concerned Medford resident with regards to us thankfully getting a grant from the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=421.563s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think obviously it's a grant that we're going to put to good use, but the resident, and I'm sure a number of residents who frequent the pond,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=431.943s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: who fought last year to make sure it remained open to only Medford residents are now making, want to make sure that that's still going to be the case if we do accept and use this grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=442.611s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I believe it's a valid question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=445.173s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I would assume and hope that this definitely will stay open to just Medford residents, but maybe we could get a report back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=452.435s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: just to confirm that and to put up people residents minds at ease.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=455.957s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think that will be very helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=458.178s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I know we have the solicitor here right now, but I don't know if he's ready to answer such a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=464.041s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'm sure you're not ready to answer it, but thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=470.624s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And before Rose called the last resolution was with regards, there was a number of people complaining to, um, the picture of the council meeting last Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=481.601s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And we spoke about, Council Marks and I spoke about the complaints we received and hopefully we can get that fixed and get the whole system, which we've been asking for fixed in the near future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=492.583s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Because for some reason, sometimes the city council meetings are not being, and no fault of anybody doing the picture, but just needs to be updated because the complaints were rolling in on Tuesday with regards to the picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=505.846s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I move approval on this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=507.506s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And ask for my colleague's support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=519.775s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=520.155s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=521.716s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: In the Medford transcript, it's a rain garden coming to Wright's pond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=526.019s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Um, the city of Medford is constructing a rain garden at the Middlesex fawn pond, fells pond that will help filter out pollutants, including phosphorus, nitrogen, suspended solids, and bacteria.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=538.067s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It will also,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=539.95s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: be designed to conserve water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=542.151s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So it's a project they're going to do in the near future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=545.074s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The rain garden project will cost the city a total of $50,000 and is a match project for a $125,000 grant that Medford received from the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=557.844s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I can go into more detail, there's another few paragraphs, but it was on page A3 of the Medford transcript.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=564.91s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The rain garden will contain plants that soak up phosphorus, nitrogen,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=568.933s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: from rainwater before it flows into Wright's Pond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=571.394s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think it seems like a natural way to remove obviously chemicals from the pond, so anything we have with regards to a grant to be able to do this I think is extremely important, especially I have another resolution on where the article does mention some concerning things as well, but I think the rain garden is definitely a step in the right direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=599.763s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Better the pond especially for the hundreds of kids that swim in that pond every every summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=642.697s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'll move approval of the question, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=645.419s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 17711, but just to respond, I'm not really sure what the confusion is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=648.261s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Sometimes when you get a state or federal grant,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=650.502s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It changes the parameters of how we operate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=653.246s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So we are making sure that the hundreds of families that use it from Medford, it remains only Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=658.954s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: This was a big issue back about a year ago when some of the law was looked into and they were potentially going to be opening it up to non-Medford residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=668.513s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: the city will kind of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=735.964s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you, President Carviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=737.705s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I wanted to bring this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=739.286s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I had a second resident email me with regards to the same article.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=743.068s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: In the second part of the article, it mentions how the city stores plowed snow on Rice Pond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=752.873s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And residents have grown increasingly concerned about pollutants in the pond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=758.976s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And then our energy and environment director said because the city<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=763.74s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: City stores plowed piles of snow near the pond in the winter, which runs into the pond when it melts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=770.005s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: This is a way for the runoff to get clean, treated, and filtered naturally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=773.609s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Hopefully the rain guards will help that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=775.77s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: But it says we've tested what is there, but there's a perception that there's bad stuff running off in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=781.635s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So a resident who does frequent the pond called me, also asked me to reference the article.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=787.12s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And it is concerning that we're putting plowed snow there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=790.959s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So this resolution and the next has to do with figuring out if we can maybe do it another way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=800.205s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: If we have runoff, there's a number of different things that are coming off the snow within the snow that are being stored at Wright's Pond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=807.809s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Maybe we should look into it more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=809.931s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And if this is a problem, then we can hopefully store the snow somewhere else because we want to make sure that we're keeping the pond as safe and clean as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=821.596s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I know that a resident was interested in the topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=826.08s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'm not sure if I can name him, but did reach out to the director of the Mystic River Watershed Association, who thought that piling up snow and allowing it to run into the pond is a poor choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=841.735s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I think this is just something that definitely needs to be looked into.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=846.577s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: If we have piled snow that can be put somewhere else, I think we need to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=850.86s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So if we could have a response from our Energy and Environment Office with regards to if there's been any testing, if so, what type of testing and when, that would be extremely helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=862.93s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And if we haven't, then maybe we should see how the rain garden goes once it's implemented, then potentially do some testing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=870.756s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That's obviously not my forte, but if we could kind of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=875.563s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: figure out what's going on here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=876.744s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I will be much appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=898.786s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you, President Carviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=899.947s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: If we could just have the Department of Public Works and or the administration, let the city council know where snow is, is kept.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=907.132s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Um, when we take it off our streets, I think that just goes hand in hand with the prior resolution to try to make sure we're storing it in the right place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0Vc0VDUwAtI&t=921.023s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1154.375s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And before Rose called the last resolution was with regards, there was a number of people complaining to, um, the pitcher of the council meeting last Tuesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1165.364s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And we spoke about council marks and I spoke about, um, the complaints we received and hopefully we can get that fixed and get the whole system, which we've been asking for fixed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1174.915s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Um, in the near future, because for some reason, sometimes the city council meetings are not being, and no fault of anybody doing the picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1183.381s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Um, but it just needs to be updated because the complaints were rolling in on Tuesday with regards to the picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1189.585s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I move approval on this resolution and, um, ask for my colleagues support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1203.515s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1205.464s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: In the Medford transcript, it's a rain garden coming to Wright's Pond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1209.946s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The city of Medford is constructing a rain garden at the Middlesex Falls Pond that will help filter out pollutants, including phosphorus, nitrogen, suspended solids, and bacteria.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1221.85s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It will also be designed to conserve water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1225.951s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So it's a project they're gonna do in the near future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1228.832s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The rain garden project will cost the city a total of $50,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1233.697s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: and is a match project for $125,000 grant that Medford received from the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1241.601s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I can go into more detail, there's another few paragraphs, but it was on page A3 of the Medford transcript.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1248.644s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The rain gutter will contain plants that soak up phosphorus, nitrogen from rainwater before it flows into Wright's Pond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1259.649s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think it seems like a natural way to remove<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1265.2s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Obviously chemicals from the pond, so anything we have with regards to a grant to be able to do this I think is extremely important, especially I have another resolution on where the article does mention some concerning things as well, but I think the rain garden is definitely a step in the right direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1281.787s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's only going to help better the pond, especially for the hundreds of kids that swim in that pond every summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1328.425s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 17711, but just to respond, I'm not really sure what the confusion is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1332.066s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Sometimes when you get a state or federal grant,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1334.327s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It changes the parameters of how we operate, so we are making sure that the hundreds of families that use it from Medford, it remains only Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1342.797s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: This was a big issue back about a year ago when some of the law was looked into and they were potentially going to be opening it up to non-Medford residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1352.335s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: the city will kind of... Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1419.753s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you, President Carviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1421.494s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I wanted to bring this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1423.075s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I had a second resident email me with regards to the same article.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1426.838s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: In the second part of the article, it mentions how the city stores plowed snow on Rice Pond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1436.645s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And residents have grown increasingly concerned about pollutants in the pond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1442.729s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And then our energy and environment director said because the city<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1447.515s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: City stores plowed piles of snow near the pond in the winter, which runs into the pond when it melts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1453.78s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: This is a way for the runoff to get clean, treated, and filtered naturally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1457.362s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Hopefully the rain guards will help that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1459.524s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: But it says we've tested what is there, but there's a perception that there's bad stuff running off in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1465.388s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So a resident who does frequent the pond called me, also asked me to reference the article, and it is concerning that we're putting plowed snow there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1474.713s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So my next, this resolution and the next has to do with figuring out if we can maybe do it another way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1483.977s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: If we have runoff, there's a number of different things that are coming off the snow within the snow that are being stored at Wright's Pond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1491.56s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Maybe we should look into it more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1493.681s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And if this is a problem, then we can hopefully store the snow somewhere else because we want to make sure that we're keeping the pond as safe and clean as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1505.419s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I know that a resident was interested in the topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1509.901s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'm not sure if I can name him, but did reach out to the director of the Mystic River Watershed Association, who thought that piling up snow and allowing it to run into the pond is a poor choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1525.506s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I think this is just something that definitely needs to be looked into.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1530.365s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: If we have piled snow that can be put somewhere else, I think we need to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1534.646s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So if we could have a response from our energy and environment office with regards to if there's been any testing, if so, what type of testing and when, that would be extremely helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1546.688s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And if we haven't, then maybe we should see how the rain garden goes once it's implemented, then potentially do some testing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1554.51s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That's obviously not my forte, but if we could kind of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1559.335s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: figure out what's going on here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1560.515s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I will be much appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1582.588s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you, President Carviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1583.769s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: If we could just have the Department of Public Works and or the administration let the City Council know where snow is, is kept when we take it off our streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1592.654s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think that just goes hand in hand with the prior resolution to try to make sure we're storing it in the right place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/c7aHV1_-sJM&t=1604.841s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=201.534s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think maybe we could do a reverse 911 call<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=205.171s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: to go out, request to go out tomorrow or the next day to notify people that there is the extension, where to send the letters, and also go on the city website if you want more information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=319.488s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: If I may through the chair, I just want to thank the speaker and all those that spoke last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=324.271s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: There was about five people here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=326.661s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: advocating for the extension of the common period and their ability to get notification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=331.625s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think that's important and they're doing it for hundreds of people in that neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=335.268s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I would just ask that we take a roll call vote, that a reverse 911 call go out tomorrow, notifying not only everybody in that neighborhood, but the entire city that there's a common period has been extended, the date, list the date and the address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=803.808s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Council Member O'Karn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=804.988s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=805.648s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: President Carviello, I just want to thank my colleagues also for bringing this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=810.611s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It is a concerning spot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=812.371s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: There is nothing at that location to shield anybody from any elements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=816.973s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think the location of it definitely discourages residents that live<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=821.363s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: in the Lawrence Estates and those who would use that transportation spot, I think it definitely deters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=828.304s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The use in a bus shelter would go such a long way, and I think it would encourage many, many more residents in this community to stop using their cars, to drive into Wellington Park and take the T, and definitely use the bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=841.847s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think it's definitely needed, and I agree with giving a few weeks to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=846.055s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: at least get some sort of response and seeing what we can do as a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=849.797s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Hopefully the mayor can get on board trying to push the MBTA with us to create a shelter there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=856.081s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think it's extremely important and I agree wholeheartedly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=858.843s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I second the approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=859.864s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1233.671s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you, President Carviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1235.312s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think the council in the last year or so has learned a great deal about community aggregation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1241.035s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We've had a number of meetings relating to it, and we also have had a very informative meeting back, I believe, in September with the energy environment director in Melrose, which I think,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1255.748s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: personally, for me, helped answer a lot of my questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1259.57s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And it was great to see another community and how the plan is succeeding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1263.672s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think one concern I do have is just Medford's ability to notify people of their rights and the ability to opt out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1276.44s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And when I do get emails or phone calls or people stop me in the street to talk about community aggregation, 80% want to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1284.591s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: move forward with it and implement it in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1287.874s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: But there are some, a good 20% if I, just going off the people that contact me, there are people that don't want government telling them what to do, what plan to go into, and they too are concerned that this 30-day opt-out, when it does become available, if potentially the council is to vote for it, there's just many concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1311.392s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: They want to make sure that that opt-out plan is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1314.781s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: well publicized, and people know how to do it, and where to go, and who to talk to, who to ask questions to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1320.906s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And one resident brought this up to me, and we discussed it in depth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1324.87s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: What if an opt-out plan was implemented, just even a database, a list of people that would relieve some of the 20% that I'm calculating from the people that I talk to, relieve them of their fears, and let them know that, no, we're not going to hide the fact that you can opt out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1342.421s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: If you want to, you can do it now, just in case something is implemented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1347.224s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I know it's a reach, but it's something that was requested by a resident, and I don't think it's a bad idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1353.428s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think the community aggregation is something that we're going to talk about within the next several months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1359.011s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And we just need to be ready on all accounts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1361.552s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I move this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1363.073s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think it's definitely something worth exploring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1365.935s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1366.655s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's just a database.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1368.336s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It could be an Excel spreadsheet of people that want to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1372.066s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: listed as not being involved in this community aggregation from the get-go, and it would give a peace of mind to those who are not interested, and maybe it would help us get the votes, maybe unanimous, maybe not, but it would get votes to implement the plan, which I know a large percentage of Medford wants to work on and work towards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1869.401s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you, President Carviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1872.101s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I understand the sentiments of my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1875.402s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I just, I don't feel, I have to just speak again on it, I guess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1879.063s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I don't feel that it would take a great amount of resources to start an Excel spreadsheet and people<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1885.086s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: call or write in, shoot a quick email to say they want to be on the opt-out list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1888.827s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I actually think that it would ease a lot of people's fears, those that definitely do not want to be part of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1895.33s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think it's simple, take minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1897.771s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I agree with Councilor DelaRusso, there is an agenda for the Office of Environment and Energy, but I don't think that that's what the people are concerned about, that the agenda won't be notifying people accordingly on their<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1913.61s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: option to opt out, how many days they have to do it, and the fact that they can opt out whenever, they're going to be put in if they don't opt out within that first 30 days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1923.816s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And that's what people are concerned about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1925.597s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So that's why you would implement something like this far beforehand, and you would be able to create that list, and people would be able to say, I want to opt out, and they would get what they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1940.425s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The people that don't want to be involved<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1942.193s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: would be able to do that sooner than later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1944.514s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And when the council does meet in committee of the whole again, maybe there would be the definite votes for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1949.897s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I think we're definitely close to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1951.818s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I know people have definitely changed their minds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1954.9s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And they've learned a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1956.381s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: There are some people that maybe are still against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1958.462s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: But for me, this is something that would make me feel a whole lot better knowing that they have more than that 30 days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1965.286s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Because that's the complaints I've been getting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1968.048s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I thought this was just a way<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1971.806s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: sway another vote towards approving it and ease in people's fears.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1976.411s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'll say it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1977.412s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1979.234s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'd like to see how it goes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1981.937s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And of course, we'll be meeting on it again in Committee of the Whole, probably after the holidays.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2401.493s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you, President Carviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2403.754s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We had met with Eversource last week and I know that a number of councilors asked questions with regards to the water pipes that are going to be closely<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2415.928s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Doug Nair above or beside the Eversource pipes, and I know a number of ours are, we all know, they're 100 plus years old, and they are in need of replacement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2429.054s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Now, I forget which councilor, but we all pushed to try to get Eversource to replace our water pipes, and they said they would approach it on a case-by-case basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2441.34s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I just wanna make sure that the city administration<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2445.191s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: really is on top of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2446.272s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I know Cassandra is going to be on top of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2448.112s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: She seemed very eager to get Eversource to pay for the majority of this work, but they wouldn't commit to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2456.056s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I think it's very important that the administration really keeps a solid eye on this and whether or not Eversource replaces the water pipes that are going to need replacing, that we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2468.226s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We look into doing this, whether this, in funding I'm sure is going to have to be appropriated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2473.169s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So we think about this before our streets are even open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2476.311s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I don't know if the administration has already thought about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2479.172s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Obviously, I understand we're going to try to get Eversource to pay for as much as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2483.274s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: But no matter what, I think these pipes need replacing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2487.257s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I think we need to definitely be proactive in making sure they do get replaced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2493.786s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: couple miles worth of digging up that Eversource is going to do in our streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2498.429s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think this should be paid for by Eversource, but our residents definitely deserve our infrastructure to be replaced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2506.654s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And when the street's being dug up, I think it's important that we do it then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2510.596s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So whatever we have to do to get Eversource to pay for as much as possible and the city come up with the rest, I think it's important, especially if we go in there and we find very old piping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2621.34s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Let me answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3920.186s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you, President Carviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3922.407s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I too have just concerns, not only about the capital plan, but I voiced my concerns last week and requested that we sit down with the administration with regards to not only the entire capital plan and where the Brooks Estates fits into that, but also<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3939.677s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: how we plan on moving forward with the restored or rehabbed building if we do spend the $200,000 to rehab it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3948.901s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I know that paper was failed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3950.562s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think my questions could have been answered in a committee of the whole meeting, but we didn't have that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3955.904s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I did reach out to Paul Mokey from the building department because I did have some questions, one of which was, if we do put $200,000 into the Carriage House<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3969.662s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: stabilize it, how long will that last us and how can it be used?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3975.964s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Briefly, he did mention that he thinks it would stabilize the building for, I'm going to read a word for it, around five years or so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3985.566s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So say then between four and six years, this building will be stabilized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=3991.047s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: He then went on to say that people could go in it, but you couldn't necessarily, and I'm not speaking for him, I did speak to him over the phone and I did email with him, but people couldn't necessarily be of use within the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4005.555s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Then I reached out to the mayor's office yesterday morning and thankfully got a little bit of a response, which was any future, I asked, what is the plan, what's the vision, if we stabilize this building,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4019.835s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: how are we going to move forward, not only with CPA funds, but how are we going to move forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4024.176s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And the answer was any future work for the Brooks Estates to be considered for funding through the CPA, which is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4032.599s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think we have a good amount of money in the CPA that is in will and should go to a number of different things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4043.081s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So in my head, calculating it a little bit, if you even took half of the CPA funds,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4049.275s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: to rehab the building, and obviously you need the money to fix the road so that it could be economically viable as an option for a function facility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4058.702s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: You need the $4 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4060.863s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Even if you took half of the CPA funds, you would only come up with between $2.5 and $3 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4069.309s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: You wouldn't have the funds to rehab the building for the purpose that, you know, the committee has obviously presented to us in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4079.414s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And that's where I find it concerning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4081.615s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Yes, this building needs to be stabilized, but if we're going to spend the $200,000, I want to know that it's for a purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4089.621s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I didn't get that answer from the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4092.643s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Are we going to use any of city monies to... And those are the questions that I think still are outstanding and need to be answered for my vote because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4104.73s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Yes, I would want to stabilize the building, but I want to know the plan, not only for that, but for the fire stations, for the roads, for all the other complaints that we get and money that we need to spend money on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4116.96s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think of the fire department taking the tour, and where they shower, there is like mold coming out of the bottom of the stalls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4123.506s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And nobody talks about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4126.648s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We're not asked to put money towards fixing the bathrooms in the fire department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4130.471s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: There's just so many different needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4134.477s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think the last time we got the capital plan was last January, February, two years ago, almost two years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4140.681s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And we sat with the mayor for an hour, we looked at the capital plan, and I think this was a component in the capital plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4147.366s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It didn't pass two years ago, and now it's before us again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4150.107s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I just think after two years, we need to sit down with the mayor as soon as next week and discuss how we're gonna move forward with the Brooks Estate, and how we're gonna move forward in this city entirely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4164.662s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: can't receive a paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4166.383s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Last week I did table it, because what the paper said was, please approve $200,000 for the Brooks Estates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4172.484s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thankfully, the Brooks Estates had somewhat of a breakdown, which was more than we sometimes get from the city administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4180.487s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: But for Paul Mokey to not even know it came before us last week, and not really, he's going to be, the building department is going to be involved in all of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4190.51s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And for him to not even know, never mind be available to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4193.539s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: answer our questions in a committee of the whole meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4195.62s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I find that extremely concerning for the taxpayers in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4200.081s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: If I voted for this tonight or last week, I wouldn't be able to answer their questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4203.943s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I wouldn't be able to say necessarily what the plan was or what I was even necessarily fully voting on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4212.086s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I don't think that's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4214.027s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I again ask that we just sit with the mayor and discuss this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4217.228s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: You very well may have my vote next week if I sit with the mayor and just figure out her vision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4223.806s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: for a million to a million and a half to do a road, plus the rehab to completely redo the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4230.387s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And then it hit the nail on the head last week when the new member of the board, who was very well-spoken, did mention that, why don't we take it down and rebuild it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4239.509s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I think one of the councilors said that a couple years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4241.849s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It was me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4242.469s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Yeah, Councilor Carvillo, you said that, why don't we rebuild it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4245.15s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It would cost us less money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4247.21s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I mean, nobody wants it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4249.111s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We want to preserve it, but it's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4251.752s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: You have to be realistic in a way where we have needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4256.293s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: People want a library.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4257.693s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: People want new fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4260.174s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We're building a new police station for millions and millions of dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4263.394s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We have needs and maintenance issues in our schools that need to be addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4268.055s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So where does this fit in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4270.876s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And that's where I'm concerned tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4272.616s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's where I was concerned last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4275.297s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Forget about personnel that we need to hire and to make our police and fire to the staffing levels that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4281.284s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: people, you know, the city wants, there's just so much that goes into this money papers and we never get a good enough, we usually always meet in the Committee of the Whole, we get our questions answered, we discuss it, we round table it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4295.23s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: For this, you know, we obviously didn't meet in Committee of the Whole and I practically begged for it last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4300.512s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think we need a meeting with the mayor on this one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4647.163s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I just want to note my opposition because I believe<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4651.26s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Questions need to be answered, even if it just took a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=441.885s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Councilor Falco stole exactly what I was going to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=445.165s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I just think when you see the baseball and softball start, you also see the younger brothers and sisters at the tot lots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=453.327s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And that's something that we always get reports come April, the swing's broken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=457.861s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: bar is missing on the, you know, monkey bars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=461.062s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So if we could just get ahead of that situation so that we, all our children can get on those taut lots and have fun while their siblings are out swinging the bat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=470.105s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=929.982s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you, President Carviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=931.622s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: If you could first just please read the resolve one more time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=962.479s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you, yes, I think that's the least that needs to be done at this point in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=968.022s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=984.253s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you, President Carviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=986.414s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I believe we have the chief of police here tonight, and I just want to thank him for coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=991.616s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I know that a number of things have transpired over the last several days and a couple months, and I know that it's under an active investigation, and what I want to say is, since the police department has found out about this, on Friday, there has been an active investigation, and I'm<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1013.806s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: really thankful for what the chief and the detectives have done so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1017.509s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I don't know what can be said tonight, but I think there's a lot of unanswered questions, and if the chief could tell us what he can, I think that would be important for the public and the parents and the staff of every school within this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1032.299s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I'll just stop there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1034.32s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1449.049s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you, President Carviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1450.169s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I just ask that, I know that's Mr. Edwards' story today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1453.69s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I just also ask that Mr. Edwards' other three stories be told as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1460.732s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: But when you found out in January, what did you know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1463.033s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Was that the same story?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1464.113s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'm telling you what I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1471.116s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So you're going by the latest story, but what you were told in January, you're just going to go with the latest?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1481.556s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I've heard four stories so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2278.011s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you, President Carviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2280.232s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: One question I have is with regards to, you said you authorized the sweep today and that was done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2286.116s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'm thankful for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2287.036s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'm thankful that there's going to be sweeps within all of our schools in this city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2290.538s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I guess my question goes to why didn't you think this was necessary when you found out in January?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2301.121s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: A sweep of the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2302.181s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That could have been there for weeks, and it was just found on the 28th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2324.189s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And what's clear to me is that you mentioned there was a plausible<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2329.358s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: reason why it was there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2330.679s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I just want to point out there's hundreds of reasons how it could have got there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2335.341s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And that makes the parents and the staff extremely uncomfortable with how this was handled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2344.006s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I question many people's judgment on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2347.368s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I guess a question now that a lot of people have, and there's a lot of questions that people have, is especially personnel that work there, because my<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2357.898s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: phone has gone off the hook since the staff has been notified as of like 2 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2362.3s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: today, they don't feel comfortable with the judgment that was made obviously by you, but by the principal of that school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2369.804s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I am under the impression he threw it away, and that's what I was told.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2378.268s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And if you knew in January, I question what he told you then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2382.93s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: you know, why it wasn't reported to the police.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2384.992s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So, I mean, I'm not gonna say too much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2386.593s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I do know some of the results of the investigation that the police are working on, but what changes are gonna be made in staff before Monday?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2478.075s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2478.435s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think by not doing anything with administration, by the school committee not doing anything with the administration is poor judgment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2486.339s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And by our superintendent of schools, who the people want to see do the right thing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2493.385s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: and to wait till the spring where parents and personnel at that school are extremely uncomfortable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2499.908s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think it's sending the wrong message.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2503.49s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I hope the school committee does what they have to do on Thursday night, because this is something that cannot be repeated, and multiple things need to happen, including, I'm just beside myself,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2521.226s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We have not done lockdown drills in our schools this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2523.866s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think we did them once, and they've only been done one time last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2527.527s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: You also have the staff who is extremely concerned because they've never done evacuation drills from cafeterias or auditoriums.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2537.689s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: There are personnel who are scared to take their children into the auditorium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2543.53s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I was there with my family a couple weeks ago, and I mean, this affects<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2549.685s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: hundreds of people that are at that school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2551.585s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And this affects our whole community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2553.706s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And it's something that really, this cannot be tolerated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2557.646s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I'm, again, thankful for the police and their investigation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2560.767s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I hope that all the questions that are being asked on social media, and I'm sure are going to be asked tonight, I hope they're answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2569.548s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I know that once the investigation is done, I know they will be answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2573.449s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'm not going to answer them, although I know a lot of the answers, because the investigation is active.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2581.206s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: But people, every single parent, and every single personnel at that school deserves every answer eventually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2590.049s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And the sooner, the better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4981.949s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I thank councilor Scarpelli for his comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4984.21s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I just have a point of information on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4986.132s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I don't think that the school committee needs to move on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4994.42s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I believe that somebody that knew about it in January has to be evaluated as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4999.623s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So that's my comment on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5003.366s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: My other last two questions, to wrap it up, would be for the Chief of Police.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5010.391s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Having multiple, multiple people come to me with this information, very upset about it, obviously for the safety of themselves, their fellow staff members, and the children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5023.499s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And then days later, knowing that I had to handle it, and they obviously needed to be handled, they now fear retaliation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5033.904s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So as a chief of police that has done everything right since I came to you on Friday, I want you to know this is the fear of personnel in that building, that they fear retaliation from the principal and from the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5049.612s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I want them to know, have your comment on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5119.075s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Or if it was placed there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5290.974s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So there'll be no retaliation of personnel in the building is what you're telling me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5295.057s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And because you're the one I trust that's here tonight, our children are safe to go to any of the Medford public schools on Monday morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5342.101s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5343.282s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And my reason for, you know, I really want to, I think I should mention my reason for asking about the retaliation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5350.468s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's because I've received a number of complaints over the last<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5354.872s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: a couple years, a number of complaints on a whole host of issues with regards to administration at McGlynn, that administrator, including retaliation, including a whole host of things that I did let the superintendent know at our committee of the whole meeting in June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5371.177s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I just think it's extremely important because you do have a lot of scared personnel out there that fear retaliation from losing their job to a whole host of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5381.541s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I just,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5383.792s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: really bothers me that they feel that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5386.914s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And, and I understand where their concern is coming from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5389.675s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So, um, I just think that's extremely important to bring up and make sure the chief is aware of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5622.043s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I go to the people I trust.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5977.923s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you, President Carviello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5979.344s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I emailed the school committee, the mayor this morning at 6 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5982.767s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: and they found out Friday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5984.448s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'm not sure about the mayor, but the school committee woman, one school committee woman said the school committee was notified Friday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8616.466s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Just on that, I thank Councilor Felco for asking that it be here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8620.068s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I would also ask that it be live.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8626.323s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We're asking to change it here, but I would further request that it be live for everybody to watch at home, those that can't make it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3276.56s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'm not saying for or against it being discussed in sixth or seventh, but I just feel that I would like to have that discussion before anything like that is taught to a sixth or seventh grader.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3356.748s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's just the ones that I read out loud, I just feel like I think I would need more discussion or actually read the curriculum, the 600 page document before I want my sixth grader to learn about STDs and how to put a condom on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cdDdeNL9hko&t=3372.979s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think that deserves much more discussion and a committee of the whole meeting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=2612.779s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Motion to approve by Member Rousseau, seconded by Member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=2616.283s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=2617.084s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=2618.205s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: All those opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=2634.94s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We just wanna make a statement and let everybody know, I know there's a number of people that wanna speak tonight, so just make a statement to let you understand when that will be appropriate, which is very soon after the superintendent's update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=2647.147s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So we know we have a number of guests with us this evening, potentially both students and staff, which is true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=2653.231s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: As the superintendent commented in multiple communications last week at Medford High School in particular, we have seen an important dialogue that has been occurring in recent days regarding student discipline,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=2664.668s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: school culture, and the overall climate of our school communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=2668.731s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: For that reason, we have an agenda item for tonight's meeting that aims to address some of these concerns and to continue a conversation we've been having for some time around how we best ensure a climate that is conducive to student growth and learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=2683.242s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: When we come to that agenda item in a few minutes, I'm gonna ask for a motion to suspend the rules so we can open up the floor to our guests and allow community participation on this subject matter in particular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=2693.763s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We have rules in place to limit the amount of time for each speaker and for purposes of being respectful, I'm going to ask that time that the speakers adhere to our three minute limitation on comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=2706.934s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: More importantly, however, because of the sensitivity of the topic, I wanna make clear that the reference of specific students or specific incidents of misconduct are not appropriate for this forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=2719.892s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The school committee is a policy making body and we do not address matters concerning specific children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=2725.673s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It would be unfair to any child to be specifically named in a meeting of a public body like this one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=2731.015s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So again, we are eager to hear from everyone tonight and we wanna give you the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=2736.716s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I know there are a lot of meetings and conversations taking place among administrators, counselors and students in recent days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=2743.257s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I think it is really important that those conversations continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=2747.551s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: But as the Memphis School Committee is a public body, we have a heightened responsibility to both make sure we are engaged in a substantive policy-driven conversation about how do we address these very concerns that our students, staff, parents, and caregivers are bringing to our attention, while also respecting the rights of everyone involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=2766.518s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So short version, please no names, and let's try to stay away from specifically describing specific incidences<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=2773.612s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So we can instead focus on the bigger picture issues that we need to address to both keep our kids safe and instill confidence in them to stay safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=2782.417s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I know the superintendent will be commenting on this in her remarks as well in just a few minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=2786.739s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So thank you for your patience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=2790.041s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: On number five, we have report of subcommittees, special education, subcommittee meeting minutes, 11-18-2021.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7068.516s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: to be completed before the end of the academic year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7071.318s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The RFP will seek a qualified and independent vendor to conduct a survey of staff, students, and families who are part of the high school community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7079.202s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And be it resolved that the project scope will include recommendations to address moving forward in a manner that prioritizes a healthy school community and contends with the district's past handling of incidences that are race, gender, and bullying based.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7096.22s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We had also resolved the recommendations will outline organizational, structural, professional development, and curriculum-based changes needed to address the findings and achieve our district-wide mission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7106.643s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We had further resolved that the school committee authorizes an expenditure of up to 50,000 to complete this important initiative, and that the superintendent will return to the school committee to seek authorization for additional funds should the qualified bids received at the bid opening be in excess of this authorization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7125.034s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: and whereas the resolution was amended to include the middle schools in the scope of the assessment, now be it resolved, the administration provide a report of all actions to date to fill this resolution, including the reasons for any delay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=396.732s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Good evening, everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=400.154s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Feel free to have a seat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=402.475s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We're going to get started somewhat on time because we want everybody to get home safe with the weather.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=414.761s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And we're trying to keep the program to less than an hour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=417.002s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So thanks for everybody for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=420.823s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: First up, I want to announce that we have a very special guest to start us off tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=426.304s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We have our first ever Poet Laureate, Terry Carter, who's going to read us a poem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=431.785s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Terry is a published author of five books.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=434.846s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Currently writing his sixth, which will go to print very soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=438.847s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: He's a huge asset to every part of our community, the schools, the West Memphis Community Center, and the community as a whole with his poetry and so much more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=448.529s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So without further ado, Terry Carter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1492.227s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1494.738s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: First, I wanna start by thanking Steve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1496.978s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I wanna start by thanking Steve Smerity, the director of communications and Emma Tombley for helping me write this speech you're gonna hear tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1509.921s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think Steve and I had a tougher job the last week cutting it down from 25 pages to nine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1515.062s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So you can thank me for that later, but there's so much that has been accomplished in this city that I wanna speak about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1522.064s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I'm gonna do that tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1524.312s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I'm not gonna rush, usually I rush, I feel so bad, I'm long-winded, but I'm not gonna rush because this work that everybody's doing on a daily basis is worth taking my time for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1534.443s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And just before I start, please know that just because something's written on a sign doesn't mean it's true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1543.212s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I'm sorry that the horns are beeping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1552.813s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I'm sorry to Terry, but the horns were beeping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1559.596s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you for those joining us here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1561.296s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you, if you're watching from home or on Zoom, I do know that we have many elected officials here, Representative Donato, School Committee woman, Kathy Kratz, Member Russo, and City Councilor Rick Carbiela, and Member Hayes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1576.422s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1576.922s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And former member, Paulette Van de Kloots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1579.023s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you for joining us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1582.09s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you to Terry Carter, our poet laureate, member Jenny Graham, and President Nicole Morrell for kicking off the event.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1589.992s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Before I begin, I must thank the tireless work of our department heads, city staff, and volunteers who have committed to doing amazing things under the difficult and ongoing conditions caused by the pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1601.856s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: You're all integral to the success that I will be highlighting here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1605.717s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: You're the reason why we're here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1608.154s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I stood before you last January and outlined my vision for Medford, listing many long-term goals, including numerous projects that are currently underway, and laid out our roadmap for the next two years and beyond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1620.621s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Now, as we begin this fourth year of growth and progress, I want to give an update on how things are going, what challenges lie ahead, and how we continue to deliver on the promises we made, the vision we shared, and the future we've imagined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1634.468s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Walking through the city, visiting places I frequented as a child, young adult, and city councilor, what struck me in many instances was how infrequently some places change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1645.194s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: A community that does not grow does not thrive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1648.016s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And here in Medford, because we have done the planning the last three years, we now are about to see growth mode.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1657.201s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We've been able to make this transition and kickstart our economic engine because of a key goal,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1662.23s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: tapping into the unrealized potential of our squares, our green spaces, and our city-owned properties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1669.396s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The most obvious opportunity to begin our next generation of development is at Wellington Station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1673.879s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The untapped 28 acres of land has been in city control for over half a century.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1680.525s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Since 1969, and in our community was completely missing out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1685.376s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: not only on the potential revenue streams, but also the exciting opportunities that could be realized with diverse transit oriented mixed use development designed to attract new families, workers, and students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1697.18s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Since we issued the request for information in September, we have spent the past few months reviewing proposals from eight highly qualified developers and released those to the public earlier this month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1708.184s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Each plan had a unique vision<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1710.606s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: for the area's potential and suggested bringing much needed housing options and other mixed use features, such as retail, office, hospitality, and green space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1720.152s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We will take you through these proposals and use them to help inform a future RFP in 2023 that fits the needs of our community and brings about generational change to the Wellington area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1733.281s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: In addition to Wellington, we're also attempting to reimagine a few underused city-owned lots in Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1739.67s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: with the help of the Metropolitan Area Planning Council working to develop priorities and criteria for future redevelopment through a community-driven analysis and visioning process that will incorporate the needs of residents and stakeholders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1753.273s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We will finally see progress on this project in the coming year and get out an RFP for Medford Square in 2023.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1761.735s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We have an opportunity with these lots to implement smart resident-focused development that aligns with our community's priorities and vision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1768.697s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: If we do this the right way, it will benefit our downtown square by creating a more sustainable and accessible future for the area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1776.924s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: But as I said, we can't do this in a silo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1779.287s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We must engage and work with our seniors in the neighborhood, our local small businesses, Chevalier Theater, and residents to access their needs, assess their needs, and implement a strategy that recognizes their importance to building a more vibrant and thriving downtown area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1795.529s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: One of the three 40B projects we are negotiating on Mystic Ave has been a topic that has garnered much debate, controversy, and discussion over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1804.431s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: There's an opportunity for meaningful, lasting development on this strip that we can't afford to miss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1809.872s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Director Alicia Hunt, Economic Development Director Victor Schrader, now part-time, and I would not settle for thousands of luxury apartments at this site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1820.503s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: and have been working with the developer on a different vision, one that can bring innovation and lasting possibilities to Mystic Avenue, a $1 billion life science development equipped with open space and first floor retail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1833.152s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: As we look to strengthen our commercial corridors, we must not lose sight of ensuring that people who will use these new developments also have the ability to continue to live in our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1844.84s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's no secret that there's a housing crunch in the region,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1847.836s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Cities across the Commonwealth are feeling the pressure to create lasting solutions to this problem and Medford is no different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1855.02s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Our city, however, is finding solutions that will bring more housing, especially affordable housing to Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1861.243s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We'll have a comprehensive master plan, which is being released very soon, will help guide our housing policy in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1867.086s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We currently have two other 40B projects that my administration is negotiating and working on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1872.517s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We worked with the developers on the project on Mystic Valley Parkway to resubmit plans to the Zoning Board of Appeals that includes 350 units, 25% of which are affordable housing units.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1884.364s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We're committed to using ARPA funds to support and assist with affordable housing projects, like the ones at our Housing Authority complexes at 121 Riverside Ave and Walkland Court.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1894.531s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We've allocated 400,000 to help offset permitting costs of renovations, thanks to the help of Bill 40,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1902.939s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: for upgrades and renovations to new affordable units at 121 Riverside Ave just this past week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1910.663s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Using existing funding sources like ARPA are helpful and allow us to make immediate expenditures to ease the burden on partners, but we're doing so knowing that we need a long-term plan for additional revenue sources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1922.83s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: ARPA will end in 2025 and we don't want our partners left holding the bag.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1927.712s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That's why establishing affordable housing trust is so important<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1931.067s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: and will help allow us to fund new projects in the absence of ARPA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1935.351s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We've done the work, communicated with stakeholders, and are ready to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1939.695s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The next step in the process is working with the council, who I know is supportive and understands the value of the trust.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1946.801s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Those are just a few of the over 30 development investments we are working on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1950.805s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: A special thanks again to our planning team led by Director Hunt and our now part-time economic development administrator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1957.751s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1968.387s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thanks to the work of our police chief, Jack Buckley, Medford PD is setting an example for how to operate as a diverse professional police force that continually engages with the community, builds new lasting partnerships and promotes inclusion and empathy with the way each of our officers conduct themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1986.956s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Aiding in that mission is the remarkable facility that the MPD calls home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1991.379s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I have made it a priority to see that the fire department has a headquarters that is just as dynamic<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=1996.482s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: and meets the current needs of our firefighters and emergency personnel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2000.706s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Also, one of the ongoing initiatives that has been moving forward over the past year is upgrades to all six of our stations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2007.471s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We have already spent over $1.3 million on over 20 projects to upgrade each of our stations, including lighting projects in each substation, roof repairs or replacements, kitchen upgrades, and one final one to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2022.244s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And we will continue to ensure these<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2024.366s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: are the best working environments to keep Medford safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2027.767s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Since day one, bringing our fire stations up to the standards of the 21st century department have been a priority of mine and my chief of staff, Nina Nazarian and chief John Friedman have been working tirelessly to get an owner's project manager hired and an architect contract signed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2044.91s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We are happy to announce that we do have an owner's project manager that we have hired and are very close to signing a contract with an architect firm<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2053.08s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: for the design of the fire head quarter building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2056.021s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: A special thank you to Medford residents, Luke McNeely and Paul Holian Jr.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2060.143s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: who have also done a lot of work, a lot of reading as it relates to this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2066.186s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Please know that these things take time, but there is a committed group pushing these projects as fast as they can with me nagging them every step of the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2076.021s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: In addition to the efforts underway for the fire headquarters, our fire substation, engine three on Salem Street, is going to have the garage floors replaced this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2084.827s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thanks to the work of this team, as well as the dedicated help of our chief officer, Fiona Maxwell, and her team, and available community block grant funding, we can move forward on this project exponentially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2097.235s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Finally, this year, we'll begin IT work of over 500,000 and are designing window repairs or replacements at all the substations too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2106.343s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That's an additional over $2.2 million investment in new projects at the fire stations with a potential over $20 million bond after that for the headquarters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2118.19s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And in order to help fund these infrastructure improvements, I spent months negotiating to have cannabis dispensaries in Medford that would benefit our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2126.495s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Our terms were eventually met and in addition to receiving the maximum 3% gross revenue coming back to the city,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2132.52s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: which will be used towards roads and sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2134.621s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We were also able to secure funding for our library, fire stations, DPW vehicles, cruisers for the police department, local nonprofit aid, veteran aid, and so much more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2146.665s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: With all of these new projects coming online and countless more already completed, it's critical that we have sufficient transportation infrastructure in place to handle the demand and allow people to get to move about the city safely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2159.687s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That's why we commissioned a street and sidewalk infrastructure assessment early in my first term and showed the city, and the city has 200 million in backlog of road and sidewalk work that needs to be fixed due to the decades of neglect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2173.278s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: This is a huge task, and although the city does not have the funding or capacity to complete this work in a year or two, we are not shying away from planning and implementation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2183.126s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We have been diligently working to complete our most critical roadways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2186.989s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: In the past few months,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2188.717s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: With the help of our city engineer, Owen Hortella, we outlined a pavement strategy for Freedom Way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2195.56s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The road was in dire need of repair and was used regularly to access schools and city facilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2201.782s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'm happy to report that we have done the initial repaving with plans in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2207.605s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Owen, there's more work to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2209.786s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: For a complete road rebuild in about two years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2212.907s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We've made a significant investment in upgrades to our sidewalks as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2217.776s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: This past year, we bonded a million dollars and we'll be going to the city council for an additional bond of 1.5 million that will include equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2226.802s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So even more work can be done in-house by our DPW team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2230.405s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you to treasurer Judy Johnson for always helping us whenever we need her, when it relates to bonds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2236.308s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We've also identified more cost-friendly options for some road repair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2239.991s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Recently, 94 streets were identified in our assessment as prime candidates for a process called crack sailing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2246.587s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Over 30 streets have been completed with roughly 60 more to finish this spring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2251.229s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We are also working on a comprehensive patchwork plan that will be finalized and released to further repair our roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2257.513s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Engineering and our Department of Public Works Commissioner Tim McGivern have been instrumental in this planning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2264.476s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: With an eye on maintaining and improving the structural integrity of our streets and sidewalks, we've made tree stump removal and tree planting a priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2271.977s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Working with our tree warden, Aggie Tudin, over the past year, we've secured over a half million dollars in funding for this work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2278.021s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And we'll continue to invest our resources towards this over the course of the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2282.564s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I want to thank our state delegation, Rep Donato, Rep Garbally, Rep Barber, for providing some of that funding for this project and many, many others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2290.99s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2300.41s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: As we upgrade infrastructure, we additionally want to continue investing in our local businesses that are so important to the fabric of community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2308.014s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: A few weeks ago, the city awarded $75,000 to 23 local businesses for storefront improvements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2314.618s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: With this second round of funding completed, we have awarded over 100,000 through small business facade improvement grants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2322.762s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I spoke about revitalizing Medford Square in my inauguration speech last year, and I'm proud to say we are working towards that goal with programs like this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2330.265s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: that inject funding and create opportunity for local businesses to thrive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2333.728s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I can't mention local services without mentioning directors, Pam Kelly, Kevin Bailey, and Barbara Kerr, who have done an excellent job running our senior center, recreation department, and library through the last few years of the pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2347.68s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And of course, without the leadership and expertise of our board of health director, Marianne O'Connor, and the staff in the health department, we would not have been able to navigate our way through the early days of the pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2359.605s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Marianne and the team, including Board of Health Nurse Sarah Harris, provided clarity and calm during a truly chaotic and scary situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2367.189s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So thank you to all, including our volunteers who helped administer over 2,800 COVID vaccines and 600 flu vaccines just in 2022, including close to 190 homebound vaccinations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2381.997s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Vaccines were administered throughout the city with the help of our community liaisons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2386.032s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: who connect the community to city resources and expand communications and accessibility to our non-native English speakers in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2394.22s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Expanding opportunities to showcase Medford's growing diversity and culture offerings has been a key part of our development strategy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2400.867s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Our parks and recreation spaces have also been upgraded with new murals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2405.251s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And just today I was at Wright's Pond working on the next with a local artist and Kevin Bailey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2411.089s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Chevalier Theater additionally renewed a five-year contract with the city back in September, bringing world-class entertainment to our hidden gem for years to come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2419.391s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We have signed a contract with a cannabis dispensary company, Theory Wellness, to construct our first-ever art center on Mystic Ave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2428.634s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: They have broken ground, and we cannot wait to see this become a reality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2433.455s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Medford's waterfront will also become a new place for residents to enjoy, with plans in the works to create more recreation areas and beautify the area<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2440.998s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: with murals and other art from the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2444.679s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We hope to release the initial design for community feedback late this winter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2450.48s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Our city services and facilities are not the only community driven spaces that deserve our investments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2455.701s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We've also been able to prioritize our local nonprofits that have been instrumental to providing critical services and resources to our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2463.202s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: In addition to CDBG funding, we awarded over 230,000 to 25 nonprofits through the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2470.322s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Community Fund Committee earlier this month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2474.025s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Included in this round of funding was the American Legion, Temple Shalom, the Medford Chamber of Commerce, and all four of our elementary PTOs, just to name a few.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2482.971s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We expect to open up the second round of funding of grants later this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2488.194s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We've talked a lot now about our progress and excitement for future projects, but we have also been met with some challenges this year, especially in our high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2496.42s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Our schools, especially the high school, have needed<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2498.959s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: to make change to better address the growing issues stemming from the pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2502.962s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I've spent, thankfully spent a lot of time over the last month with our superintendent, Dr. Maurice-Edward Vincent, as well as other district leaders, pushing for plans that are sustainable, adaptable, and work in the best interest of students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2516.052s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We have two newly trained student resource offices, a revised bathroom plan, and are engaging with students on a much more personal level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2523.798s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: But most importantly, we have heard the students' concerns and listened to their lived experiences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2529.602s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We must strengthen our relationships and trust with both the students and caregivers and ensure that our school system is safe and an inviting place for all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2540.57s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: As Jenny stated, we're still looking to obtain an MSBA loan to build a new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2545.753s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The building we have now is not amenable to quality education, and we believe we have a strong case for the next round of loans due in April to rebuild a state-of-the-art flagship school that our students and faculty deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2558.973s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I thank the school committee, the superintendent of schools, Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent and Mr. Dave Murphy for all their work on that application and we will be resubmitting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2567.217s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: As our community continues to grow as a destination for families and professionals, there is a significant opportunity to expand accessible and efficient public transportation options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2580.143s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: As I'm sure you've all seen and hopefully written, the Green Line Extension finally opened in December after many challenges, delays and questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2588.1s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That was probably the happiest I've seen people at 5 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2590.821s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: on a Monday morning cramming in line to get a spot on the T. That just proves that the extension is a turning point for Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2598.345s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I want to thank the community group that advocated and worked on this project for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2603.307s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I will never stop pushing for better public transportation in and around our community as I did with the MBTA new better bus redesign and the closure of the orange line over the summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2614.052s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I thank director Todd<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2615.886s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: director of traffic and transportation, Todd Blake, for being the expert this city needs, advocating with us, working with us, and advising us along the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2625.29s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2634.554s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: With his help and many others, we've also increased the scope of blue bikes around the city this year with three new docking stations at Tufts Square, Brooks Park, and Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2643.24s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We are working to expand this network further as alternative green transportation options support our climate action and adaptation plan, including efforts to provide residents with clean, sustainable, and affordable alternatives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2655.267s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'm happy to announce that we have secured funding for seven additional Blue Bike locations, with the next three coming online later this year at Hormel Stadium, Harris Park, and Spring Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2665.172s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: For the four remaining, we're tentatively exploring Riverbend Park, Haines Square, West Medford, and the Hillside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2671.963s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: As outlined in our Climate Action and Adaptation Plan, we have lofty goals of reducing our emissions by 50% by the end of this decade and have been working to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2682.285s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: To do this, we've taken a series of steps aimed at making our city operations, facilities, and policies more conducive and adaptable to climate resiliency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2692.387s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The last time I spoke at this podium to you all, I mentioned that we were in the process of securing funding for two additional electric charging stations with the hope of installation this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2702.247s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thanks to the work of the Planning, Development and Sustainability Office, especially the work of Planner Yvette Niwa, we've delivered on the promise and have two new stations, one at Hormel and one at Carr Park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2713.455s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I'm happy to announce that we're expanding on that growth with two more, one at the Missittuck School and one at Tufts Park, coming online this summer with an additional seven being planned over the next year or so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2724.744s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: But to implement real changes in the way we conduct our operations, we must commit to reversing our reliance on fossil fuels internally as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2732.705s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: This is also a priority of our city council and school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2736.686s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'm happy to announce that we have secured $230,000 grant Diesel Emissions Reduction Act from the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act from the state with the help of Mike Wentzel from DPW to assist with the purchasing of an all electric commercial grade sweeper, which will replace our diesel engine vehicle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2754.313s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We also made concerted efforts to transition our other vehicles in our fleet to more green friendly options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2760.199s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The police department has purchased new hybrid vehicles and is patiently waiting for their arrival, hopefully in June, which will make their daily operations much more efficient, cleaner, and adaptable to challenges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2772.782s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We also thank director Faye Morrison, who will also be transitioning her fleet in the near future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2780.404s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The city is additionally enhancing its climate resiliency and emergency preparedness efforts through our MedFit Connects program led by our office of prevention and outreach manager,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2789.721s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Penny Fanioli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2791.482s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: This program seeks to expand and strengthen resources for our underserved community members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2796.005s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And we recently secured a grant, another grant for over 400,000 from the state to accomplish this work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2805.731s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: An important part, I'm almost done, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2808.113s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: An important part of our commitment to expanding resources and programming for residents is our investment in our green spaces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2813.836s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Medford's many parks are a source of pride for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2817.469s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: and we have plans for upgrading the construction in many of them, close to 50, actually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2823.47s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I engaged an internal team who have been meeting close to monthly for three years to plan, gain community input and secure funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2830.152s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: In projects scheduled to start this spring and summer alone, we have secured over $5 million for renovations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2836.474s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: One of our largest upcoming projects is Car Park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2839.514s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Car Park's vision plan was released the end of 21,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2842.654s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: and we are proud to say that phase one is fully funded and in design and expected to start this spring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2848.999s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Car Park recently secured additional funding for phase two, which is on the horizon as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2855.324s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: In phase two, we can get excited for new basketball courts, one which will be covered by solar panels, a new playground and much more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2861.789s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Car's solar infrastructure will be funded by $1.5 million earmark in the federal 2023 budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2868.254s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I wanna thank our federal delegation, including Congresswoman Clark, Senator Markey, Senator Warren, for their work in passing this budget and helping fund community projects here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2878.983s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Our planning office has been instrumental in this work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2882.085s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thanks to their work, especially again, Director Hunt and Planner Amanda Centrella, we have not only secured opera funding, but a match of $1 million from another grant from the Land and Water Conservation Fund for phase one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2895.996s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Awesome job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2904.505s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Upper funds have made a huge impact on our community in the work we are able to do throughout the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2909.427s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Unlike other communities that set specific funding amounts for various sectors, Medford has taken a needs-based approach, allowing us to invest funding where it is needed most.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2919.79s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The data we collected from the community focus survey released this past summer helped inform many of the projects I've mentioned already tonight, with many others that I don't have time for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2929.673s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: With the help of our amazing federal funds manager, Lorena Escalero,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2934.551s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We will be continuing to invest in areas like affordable housing, public health and infrastructure, as well as plan for the future while being transparent with the work we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2943.476s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Throughout our opera planning process, we have been open and transparent about our financial outlook and the need to allocate a percentage of funding to revenue replacement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2951.441s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Like many other cities and towns in the Commonwealth, the economic effects of the pandemic left a sizable gap in several revenue streams that we traditionally have counted on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2961.027s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: For the past two years,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2961.923s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: the years we have reduced our reliance on ARPA dollars and expect the trend to continue in fiscal year 24 and 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2967.227s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's no secret that the city has incurred a structural deficit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2971.59s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And though we have several dynamic development opportunities on the horizon that will inject revenue into our bottom line, thanks to our assessing team, especially, I see Jim O'Brien and Ellen as well have been great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2985.641s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We are analyzing the potential need to come to a solution as to how to fill and address the gap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2992.529s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: especially when ARPA is gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=2994.85s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We are closely monitoring and reviewing the need for an override in the future to ensure we keep performing work at this level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=3002.675s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: These decisions are not easy and we must balance the need and the ability to pay while taking into account that we will need a debt exclusion to build a new high school in the not too distant future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=3014.382s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Since hiring CFO Bob Dickinson and budget manager Courtney Cordello,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=3018.919s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We are back to our baseline staffing levels in the finance department, and my office and the finance team have been hard at work with department heads, collecting information early in the process for the formulation of the fiscal year 2024 budget, especially given the global economic issues that persist, such as inflation and supply chain, in addition to recovering from the structural deficit of the pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=3041.706s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Fiscal year 24 is expected to be another difficult year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=3045.285s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: However, we continue to work hard to get the city's revenue stream to the needed levels to sustain the city's needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=3052.929s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Again, I want to thank everyone at City Hall that made all this work possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=3056.951s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: While we're still working to optimize our staffing levels, the strength of the team that I have put together over the last three years in office has completely changed the culture of City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=3068.402s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: and other places and helped usher in much needed modernization and efficiency updates in city hall operations and policies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=3076.049s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Together, we are building the groundwork to professionalize Medford like never before and create a more meaningful and welcome experience for our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=3084.756s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We have so many new hires that have been instrumental to that change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=3088.78s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Those that I've already mentioned, as well as Jeremy Johns, our director of veteran services, Melissa Ripley, our elections manager,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=3096.601s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Jim Silver, our special projects coordinator, Bill Forty, our building commissioner, Paul Riggi, the city's first ever facilities director, a position the council and I advocated in favor for for the last 10 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=3109.503s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And thank you to HR and our director, Neil Osborne, and the efforts of so many others for keeping this process moving forward and helping fill roles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=3119.045s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Accountability has been key to transforming the way our city works and serves our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=3124.758s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Without accountability, it's impossible to get a professionalized government that the city needs and the people deserve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=3133.72s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Part of accountability is ensuring every city employee and resident is aware of the importance of diversity, equity, inclusion, and has the means and support to actively promote equity and accessibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=3144.662s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's part of our social justice roadmap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=3146.522s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And with the help, amazing help of our director of diversity and equity inclusion, Francis Waje,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=3152.947s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The city has and will continue to expand DEI training for all staff, city, fire, and police, including implicit bias and cultural competency training.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=3163.769s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I've said it before, there are things I will not tolerate and no one will discourage me from doing this hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=3170.791s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We can do hard things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=3172.952s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We can transform this city and rid ourselves of the antiquated, outdated, and inefficient policies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=3179.684s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: But it takes time, it takes focus, and it takes trust.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=3184.045s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I'm asking you to trust me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=3186.086s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Trust me to do this work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=3190.607s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And trust me to lead this city to where we all know that it should be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=3196.289s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Because there is much more to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=3198.329s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It is often not comfortable or fun having to make<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=3201.929s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: these hard choices and do the necessary work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=3205.19s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: But I've seen and heard about governments run without accountability and they quickly become chaotic and corrupt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=3211.591s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I will not let that happen here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=3214.892s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I am committed to a transparent ethical administration for the city and thus will not tolerate city employees who do not share that same work ethic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=3224.654s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That said, to be clear, the vast majority of our city employees come to work every day and try their best to move the city forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=3231.59s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: many of whom I've mentioned tonight and all of whom I just don't don't don't have all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=3237.352s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I do and I will continue to do all I can to support them in every way I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=3242.454s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: To conclude, please know that so much work has been put work has been put in over the last year to find creative solutions to any roadblocks the city faces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=3252.439s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: When searching for funding, we find grants and secure them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=3261.479s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: When we say we are going to do something, we do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=3264.44s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I am dedicated to keeping my promises to Medford and delivering on projects, no matter the challenges we face along the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/EzhtyjkzgTA&t=3272.744s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And finally, and thankfully, we have the personnel to make it happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qF2odNDrmLM&t=5.818s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: This is a joke, and this is disgusting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qF2odNDrmLM&t=71.664s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I believe it was an orchestrated event.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6296.624s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Next up, we have new business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6298.385s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We have offered by member and Tapa recognition of Autism Acceptance Month, whereas Autism Acceptance Month is recognized in the month of April.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6326.564s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: to the public and report to the Memphis School Committee on steps being taken with the Memphis Public Schools to support students impacted by autism spectrum disorder, ASD, and how we go about identifying students who may need these services that have yet to receive them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6346.093s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Explanation, those within the advocates of the autism spectrum,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6351.169s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Community are looking to distance themselves from groups that treat autism as a disease and something that needs to be healed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6357.152s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The focus is not on awareness of autism spectrum disorder, ASD, but more of a focus on acceptance of the members of our community that fall under the autism spectrum and making sure there are equitable systemic pathways for their success, being conscious of decisions that may impact members of the ASD community, both systematically and socially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6376.961s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: This is the first step in this process to better understand<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6380.302s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: and see how we as a city can better serve our community members impacted by ASD.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6384.885s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'll turn it over to you Member Ntapa for a motion or anything else you'd like to add.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6746.709s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Okay, so you're looking for information rather than us providing services to people that need them, even if they haven't been identified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6754.373s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Right, I'm looking, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6756.114s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So you're looking to change that report to the school committee on steps being taken to provide supports for those impacted by autism spectrum disorder?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6767.021s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Correct, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6768.041s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Good, as an amendment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6785.617s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Okay, so then just strike the second half of that, number three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9275.72s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Guillen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9277.181s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: If I may, from the chair, and then I'll go to Member Ntapa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9281.005s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I just want to point out that this was a long week of not only reading 208 pages of applications, but also working as a group of three trying to discuss the pros and cons of different makeups of this committee and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9296.866s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: For me, I just want to let everybody know, I just feel like it's a little bit overloaded with politicians, especially where Jenny and I are already members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9306.074s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So for me to agree to a non-voting member, which I know is going to be a separate vote, I mean, I'd have to...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9313.96s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: suggest that we put two to four others on as non-voting alternates so that we can just balance this committee out a little bit more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9322.863s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That was my concern over the week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9325.203s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: There are 94 resident applicants, all highly qualified, and I had a struggle with that balance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9335.946s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: and there was some give and take, and it was agree to disagree type situations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9340.089s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: But I just wanted to make that clear from my perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9343.812s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I want to make sure that this committee can move forward without any issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9350.096s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And the only way I could see voting for one non-voting member is if we have a committee of, you know, a group of two, a group of three or five, which would serve as non-voting alternates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9362.946s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Member Ntapa?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9662.362s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's people that applied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9714.053s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So two additional non-voting alternates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9724.058s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We can change the amendment and just add two alternates from the community, non-politicians, or we could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9736.22s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Point of clarification, member Antapa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9809.723s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think it should probably be from that pool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5698.393s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: both provided significant opportunities for schools to end our dependence on fossil fuel infrastructure, whereas the climate crisis is an existential threat to the survival of our species and countless other species we share our planet with, whereas the climate crisis is primarily caused by human activity through the release of greenhouse gases, whereas today's leaders must take action now to ensure a sustainable future for generations to come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5725.167s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Now, therefore, be it resolved that the Medford School Committee<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5728.081s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: One, bans the purchase of new or replacement fossil fuels powered equipment used to operate our school facilities, such as HVAC equipment and kitchen equipment, may authorize the purchase of banned equipment in emergency situations at a regular or special meeting of the committee, and must authorize equipment purchases covered by this resolution, regardless of the revenue source, such as municipal funding or grants from governmental or non-governmental organizations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5753.649s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I know we have our team, our city team, and they brought some guests with us to discuss the HVAC system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5759.694s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think I was talking to Brenda this weekend about the process to fixing our HVAC at the two middle schools, somewhat related here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5769.321s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I don't know if you want to hear from them or a member that has this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5884.144s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Member Reinfeldt, do you want to say anything?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5951.656s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Director Hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6023.329s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Is there a motion to table?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6200.206s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: If I may, just from the chair, and then I'm gonna acknowledge<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6205.502s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Director Hunt and her team have taken on quite a bit to help, plus Paul Riggi, who's our facilities and maintenance director over in the city side and through requests coming from me, which obviously are coming through the school committee, they've spent a lot of time working on the light posts on Freedom Way, keys, new cameras, and now HVAC, so I understand you want to move this forward tonight, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6230.919s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Director Hunt respectfully asked that we table this basically until they at least give their presentation and we can always go back to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6238.024s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I think out of respect for city staff working tirelessly for school needs because they want to help, I would ask that the committee respect that request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6250.754s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: member Rousseau and then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6304.284s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: approved funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6305.224s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I have not signed a contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6307.085s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That's why they're presenting tonight on work that I asked them to do, but it was the committee that has discussed it over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6315.449s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's the teachers union who brought a grievance because our air conditioning doesn't work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6319.331s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And we said we were going to commit to fixing the air conditioning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6323.033s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So this is the base work and they're here before I've ever even signed a contract because obviously they're going to present to you first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6329.856s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I don't know why fixing air conditioning is so upsetting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9381.761s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Yep, no, I think that what you could do for the project is support this plan and let our teams move forward and get it done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9391.363s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: OPM is going to be a whole cost in itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9393.772s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So that will come out of ARPA funding, and then we will move forward with most likely a bond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=2636.186s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That'd be a $500,000 reduction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4844.948s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Hines was the director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5849.329s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think, oh sorry, member Olapoday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5961.868s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Remember all about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6557.533s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6559.777s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8732.435s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Just to piggyback on that from the chair, there's a group of us that have been meeting since the early fall, maybe September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8739.599s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Member Graham, myself, and two members of the city council, chair and vice chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8745.262s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And in, I believe it was late March, we did put out a press release where we just let the voters know, let the residents know that we are exploring two debt exclusions, one for the fire headquarters and one, of course,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8760.39s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: flagship new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8762.531s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: In that, we also mentioned that this fall, there'll be two elections, one in September, one in November, and we do plan on putting potentially two override questions before the voters, one to help fund our schools and one for a potential sidewalk street maintenance crew that could help and provide support to our DPW and focus mainly on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8788.81s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: the lack of maintenance that we've been able to put in based on Chapter 90 funding to our streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8795.333s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So that it has been discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8797.034s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's not been discussed as a full committee, obviously, because we have open meeting law rules that we have to follow, but it is something that we are putting forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8806.378s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I don't know if that will be September or November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8808.799s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Our next task force meeting is Friday, I believe, but obviously that is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8814.571s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The position we are in, we used one-time funding for the budget for the last four years because of the pandemic, because of the lost revenues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8824.696s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We have been able to dwindle that down, of course, because those large buckets, we're in this position because all expenses are up, as well as all of our salaries and expenses cannot be met by the 2.5% that we're able to tax the voters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8843.084s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's just too much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8844.758s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: compiling that with these one-time funds that we've used, whether it be on the school side, I think about 1.5 million to 2 million, and then on the city side, luckily, we've been able to find a few grants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8857.148s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The Barr Foundation's one that's gonna be able to absorb some of the positions we have, but we're also doing some hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8866.756s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think tonight is where I really realized where the gap was, because obviously you haven't called each of us<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8872.757s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: explained fully other than when we've been in executive session or meetings or school committee meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8878.779s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So my next several days will be trying to talk to my finance director and working through the city side budget to make the necessary cuts to be able to provide more to the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8890.323s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: At first I thought that was about a half million and come this weekend and tonight I'm realizing it's much more and that's including with some significant cuts that we all feel<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8902.415s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: pretty upset about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8903.295s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I mean, I don't think there's a person behind this rail that either doesn't have a headache or a stomachache because this is real lives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8909.037s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: This is our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8909.997s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: This is, this is real and it's, it's not a fun position to be in whatsoever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8916.418s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And as I talked to mayors across the state and I've talked to many, it seems like everybody is in this position because of these large buckets of one-time funding and people are doing overrides or having major cuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8929.822s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think we're trying to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8931.986s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We're trying to figure it out before we put a question for the residents, and I do think that will pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8937.628s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think that's a balancing act, because we need to make sure we get a debt exclusion for potentially several hundred million dollars approved for a new high school, but it's the hard work that we have to do, and it's a tough week that I have ahead on the city side to try to figure this out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8954.913s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So that's where I am.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8960.086s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Obviously, the first time this presentation was before us, so there's a lot of things that I didn't even know until tonight, and I appreciate the presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8966.729s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I know there's a number of people that would like to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8969.37s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We have a number of people online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8971.271s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We have a number of people here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8974.192s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: There's a lot more work we have to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8975.413s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: This is very early.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8976.913s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We gave the schools the numbers before the local receipts were in, before we had estimates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8981.735s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Hopefully, we can budge there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8984.076s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: City councils do a budget May 31st if they get all their budget meetings in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8988.413s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So so there is it's early in the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8990.475s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's not a fun place to be in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8992.017s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think we all have said that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8994.419s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So just hoping we can get to public comment after the school committee rests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=9038.958s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2733.422s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2734.123s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you, president bears and counselors for allowing me some time to speak to you about the fiscal year 25 budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2740.568s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Before I begin, I must take this opportunity to thank everyone who contributed to the completing this budget and delivering it to your honorable body by the newly established deadline per the budget ordinance, compiling this comprehensive breakdown of the city's financial outlook took countless hours of preparation, debate, and insight from our department heads and our budget team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2760.902s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: led by our Finance Director, Bob Dickinson, Assistant Finance Director and Budget Director, Courtney Cardillo, and my team in the Mayor's Office, led by Chief of Staff Nina Nazarian.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2770.875s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I also need to credit both Courtney and our Communications Team, Director Steve Smerdy,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2775.532s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: and Emma Tombley, our communications specialist for putting in so many hours of work on the nitty gritty aspects of the budget book that tend to get overlooked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2785.38s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: This work is invaluable and will hopefully lead us to a second Distinguished Budget Award from the Government Finance Officers Association.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2794.915s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Last year, I stood before you and laid out the challenges that lay ahead for fiscal year 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2800.018s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Our looming fiscal cliff due to the expiration of ARPA and ESSER funding, the continued rise in consumer prices, as well as the decades of neglect of critical infrastructure upkeep as it relates to our roads, sidewalks, water and sewer infrastructure system that are catching up to us now, including our buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2822.97s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Most of these are not new or surprising obstacles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2826.052s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: They have always been at the forefront of financial planning, guiding our strategy and shaping the decisions we make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2832.015s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Now, as we approach the end date, it's important to understand that measures we must take to ensure that our city and school services, programs and projects are properly funded and staffed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2842.714s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: As I wrote in my budget message last week, the school's budget was by far the toughest one to develop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2848.677s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Due to the timeline of the budget ordinance, we needed to supply the school department with an estimated operating budget figure in March.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2855.8s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: At that time, we did not have concrete figures for the city's previous year's actuals or next year's projections, thus making the school's number more of a guide than a strict dollar amount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2866.425s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: But it's no secret that the schools used the remaining ESSER funds last year<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2871.305s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: and are operating at a deficit, committing one-time funding sources to plug this gap continually is not a long-term solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2879.528s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The school budget was facing a cliff, and cuts had to be made to right-size our spending and balance the fiscal year 25 budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2887.39s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Our city team then thoroughly reviewed each line item on the city side, dove deeply into expenditures, compared numbers with previous year's actuals, and worked to bring those figures down to a more reasonable and sustainable level in order to provide as much funding to the schools as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2904.756s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Additionally, we reviewed our new growth numbers, workers' compensation numbers, assessed IT vendor contracts, and really dove headfirst into the fine details of the city budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2915.384s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The hard work over the last two months adjusting the city budget revenue projections and other city line items allowed us to increase the school budget from our fiscal year 24 numbers of 71,200,000 to 76 million for fiscal year 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2931.668s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That's nearly a 7% increase of general fund allocated monies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2936.709s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'm immensely proud that we're able to come to this number and supply the schools with a significant increase from last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2943.285s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: but it's still not enough to avoid cuts and creates additional obstacles to learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2949.848s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think it's important to understand just how we've gotten to this point at both the school district and city hall, with each budget season being such a challenging and in many ways, a discouraging process for all involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2963.394s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Each year, the budget I propose and the budget that this honorable body votes on is balanced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2969.042s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And while that allows us to pay for all our obligations, it creates a situation where most of our costs, which generally significantly increase year over year, exceed the amount we're able to raise in taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2981.148s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Per Massachusetts general law, Medford and all other municipalities in the Commonwealth cannot increase our tax levy, which is one of the major components of the city's revenue sources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2990.572s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We raise from real and property taxes by more than 2.5%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=2996.909s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: meeting the operating budget can't keep up the cost of living.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3000.991s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: This in some cases creates the need for scaled back programming, staff reductions and other resource losses to properly balance the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3011.021s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I know there has been some discussion on rating our reserve funds to plug our structural deficit gap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3016.502s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That is not sound financial practice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3019.003s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Dipping into our savings to fund something for one year is just simply a bad idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3023.964s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's why our team worked so hard to reduce our reliance on one-time funding to offset revenue loss in my previous four budgets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3031.752s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The funding we received from the federal government with the passage of the American Rescue Plan Act, also known as ARPA, allowed us to inject capital to plug various gaps during the early years of the pandemic when revenues were down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3044.764s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: By making strategic one-time investments, we were able to save on annual operating budget space, which created more flexibility when crafting the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3052.952s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The pandemic also caused us to reevaluate much of our thinking on the use of one-time funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3057.981s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It also changed the way the public interacts with government, so much so that we now must allocate funding to new items that have become essential as post-pandemic life continues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3068.467s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: For example, prior to 2020, City Hall did not regularly host meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3073.91s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Now that is common and expected practice, which requires more resources, technology, infrastructure, and staff training, which all carry an expense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3082.775s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That brings us to an override measure, which I'm proposing to appear on the ballot in November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3087.773s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: This has been a topic of debate in the council chambers, my email box, in homes, coffee shops, ball fields, and around our squares for several years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3097.203s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think two things are simultaneously true as it relates to an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3101.387s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It would undoubtedly help us maintain and hopefully enhance our services, and it would create hardships for many people in our city struggling to stay afloat financially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3112.594s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Our financial task force established earlier this year has been meeting regularly to work through, negotiate, and discuss the best path forward for the city, schools, and community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3123.582s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Considering the financial pressures many of our residents are facing, as well as the need to increase our revenues to account for costs outpacing our 2.5% levy threshold, we have concluded that in November, the voters should decide on if they want to adequately fund our programs, positions, and projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3141.846s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: one on a debt exclusion for a new fire headquarters, and two Proposition 2 1⁄2 overrides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3147.609s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The first override question would ask voters to approve raising $3.5 million to stabilize Medford Public Schools funding, including but not limited to funding costs such as teachers, literacy coaches, behavioral specialists, administrative assistants, nurses, and for regular facilities maintenance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3166.055s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And for our Department of Public Works, 500,000 for additional staff for road and sidewalk infrastructure repairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3173.617s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The second override question would ask voters to approve raising 4 million to invest in Medford Public Schools to create a high school schedule that increases access to arts and vocational programming, expands classroom instructional opportunities, and for classroom teacher and paraprofessional compensation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3191.087s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The debt exclusion question would ask voters to approve funding of a bond of up to 30 million to be issued for the design and construction of a new Medford Fire Department headquarters at 120 Main Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3202.952s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The expected cost of these three combined questions would increase property taxes for the average single family home, which is assessed at about $770,000 by approximately $446 per year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3211.716s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That would be about $37 per month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3219.991s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: But since our schools need to be right-sized now, I've asked your body to approve an amendment to the budget to increase the school's budget allocation from 76 million to 77.75 million through the use of 1.75 million in one-time funding advance, 500,000 of which will fund the purchase of Chromebooks and laptops and begins an annual refresh cycle to maintain our district-wide technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3245.629s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Now this is one-time funding, so if the first override question does not pass, then we will be right back here in the same position next year with cuts on the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3255.097s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: But passing these overrides is by no means an easy decision, and I recognize that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3260.601s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: In fact, coming to these numbers was a painstaking process, and I'm still wary of the financial burden increased taxes may have in our community, especially in those struggling to get by, and that weighs heavily on me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3275.273s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Ultimately, I believe the question of pass would fulfill our greatest needs, mainly in our schools and for our children, but also help make progress on the number one complaint we get, which is the conditions of our roads and sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3288.378s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I know this is the right decision because the alternative will mean more cuts and more challenges for our residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3293.519s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And in my opinion, we cannot afford to continue on that path.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3297.741s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Our residents deserve the right to take a vote on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3302.213s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: This is a big decision that requires considerable thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3305.215s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I truly believe, however, that approving these ballot questions is the right thing, and I hope the majority of the community agrees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=3660.024s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: While it's important that we expand our tax base in this sector, we must also consider the enormous barriers, both structurally and financially, for families, workers, and individuals attempting to find meaningful and sustainable housing in our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5413.455s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5414.395s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Um, just a few points from councilor scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5418.756s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: First off is I just want to point out that we do probably twice a year, press releases on development strategy and what our team and PDS has been doing throughout the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5430.759s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The last one was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5433.322s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: late fall, it's on our city website and it outlines all the work that we've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5438.904s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I just wanna point that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5440.885s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We have six housing developments, including 240Bs that are moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5448.328s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We have five life science developments that are moving forward, Riverside Ab, Boston Ab, Sycamore, et cetera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5456.636s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We also have the Great American Beer Hall, commercial, retail, mixed-use developments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5460.979s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: There's another whole list that has been moved forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5464.742s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I think it's a shame to say that we've done nothing in the last few years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5470.506s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So that's always open to the public, and we do send that to every councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5473.528s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I just don't know if everybody reads it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5476.11s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Second, I had a...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5478.652s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: planning department outline, because it's said quite often that we've lost opportunities on these 40 Bs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5487.096s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: First, there's one that keeps submitting and withdrawing, so that is what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5492.579s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We did do our GLAM analysis and we did in-state Safe Harbor<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5499.548s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: there was two developments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5500.849s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: One was Mystic Valley Parkway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5502.01s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That's the one that's moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5504.632s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And then there's a Felsway that's in the middle of, between the Felsway commercial and then a fully residential neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5511.176s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So by instituting Safe Harbor, we've been able to get these developers to come to the table and negotiate with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5520.836s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: If we didn't install our safe harbor status, we would have had no seat at the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5526.584s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We would have been able to get no community benefits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5529.848s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And if you wouldn't indulge me, I'll just maybe I have multiple pages on the first two and I can just.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5536.316s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'll actually read the first one that's moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5538.958s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's 4,000 Mystic Valley Parkway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5540.659s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We've reduced density from the original proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5543.721s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We split it into two buildings for more manageable scale.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5547.884s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We asked them to put in a shared use path around the entire property, not accessible vehicles on two sides, improve amenity space for residents with intentional play areas, significantly improved architectural design,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5651.243s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I wanna say that this is probably, in my 23 years, it's been the most collaborative that school committee, city council, and the mayor's office has been.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5660.106s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I think I said that to you after the election in November, that I just feel like these three bodies are gonna be able to work better and more collaboratively than they ever have, because you all do the work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5671.89s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Whether people like it or not, whether they think you're moving too fast, you're doing the work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5678.993s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'm a witness to it every night that I'm at the meetings and I know what some of the, some or all of the school committee members put together behind the scenes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5688.019s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And this has been transparent since day one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5690.3s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It was 2022 when Councilor Behrs and Councilor Collins discussed it at the council meeting and wrote a public memo that you thought an override should be on the ballot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5703.576s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I wrote a public memo back that I agreed, 12 million, 3 million, but that's that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5709.68s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And since then, we, yes, we talk on the phone, we talk behind closed doors, but it's all transparent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5716.705s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: When we went through the budget last year, we did, we sat down, we discussed it, just, Councilor Sang, you were also in the room, we discussed it, we said, what's the path forward, how are we gonna manage, how are we gonna build a better budget and a better budget process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5729.354s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And we did a press release, that was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5732.403s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Correct me if I'm wrong on specific dates, but in June of 2023, we put out a press release on exactly what we agreed on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5741.169s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Nothing more, nothing less.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5743.25s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Transparency, that's transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5745.391s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We started a meeting in the fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5746.872s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I believe our first meeting might've been the end of September, beginning of October.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5750.435s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Again, put out another press release.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5753.056s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We then worked through the struggles that we are facing financially over the last several months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5757.728s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Yes, the five of us were in that room for the task force meeting, but member Graham and myself were meeting with the CFO of the schools and our superintendent, quite regularly, as well as the school committee meeting on the floor to talk about the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5771.89s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: myself and my chief of staff, as well as the counselors, I'm sure, we're talking to our CFO, who I also think has an amazing mind, regularly, my chief of staff every day, myself at least weekly, or sometimes multiple times a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5787.633s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So yes, we had two CFOs working on this process, not in the room every step of the way when we met as a group of five, but we talked through what we thought was the best path forward and how we could<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5800.1s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: get this budget approved and still provide for our city and mainly our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5804.682s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I'm proud of the work we've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5806.062s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Gone are the days where we're negotiating jobs for friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5810.964s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That doesn't happen anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5812.445s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We're negotiating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5813.245s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We truly care about this city and we care about the future of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5817.267s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And that's why you have the three ballot questions before you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5819.855s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: People can vote yes, people can vote no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5822.017s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: They're split into three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5823.138s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We could have done two, but I think three was the best way to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5827.202s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: People have a choice, and they have a choice in November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5830.225s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It is months and months away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5831.646s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: There's gonna be campaigns on both sides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5834.189s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: There's gonna be things we're restricted from doing after potentially the vote tonight if it passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5839.16s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: but it's up to the people now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5841.541s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So, I mean, there's more I could go into.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5844.442s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I am listening to residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5846.563s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: This money will not go into a black hole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5848.124s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's gonna go towards literacy coaches.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5850.125s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's gonna go towards a nurse so that he or she is not let go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5854.286s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's gonna go to teachers because we wanna keep the levels as much as we can in our school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5862.95s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's gonna be the best way forward for our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=5866.851s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I just wanted to address the councilor, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7379.316s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'll only comment on a few things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7382.358s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I just take sincere offense to say that, for one, to say that things have been mismanaged financially for five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7390.725s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We've had two CFOs in the last five years and they've both done a great job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7394.428s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I just want to comment on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7397.825s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Second, and I know it's been said by my chief of staff a number of times, I have to address the legal costs of the city of Medford, because there is a number of us that sat and we reviewed budgets in 16 different communities, and we were the first or second lowest in legal, paying legal costs, and that includes- If I may.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7421.921s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Excuse me, I have the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7424.514s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That that includes outside legal counsel as well as Coleman and page who we use as the 40 municipal attorneys that specialize in different things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7434.918s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: In comparison, I'll give you one city, Malden, very similar to us, spends about a million point two in legal costs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7441.88s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Medford spends a bit over 400,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7444.381s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think it was 450,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7444.821s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I just want to put that into perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7448.182s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And then the council also mentions cleaning things up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=7451.443s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Maybe he's offended by what I've done the last four years, but I've brought accountability to this community and I am so proud of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=8022.358s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Yes, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4792.963s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4795.265s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Just to piggyback from the chair, if I may, on Member Graham's point, I think we did have discussion on the afterschool programming piece in the past, and I think we all agreed that we were going to try to, this would be a great addition, obviously, for afterschool programming, but also make sure that we don't create more spots for one year and then can't fulfill them the year after is one<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4821.052s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: thing we just want to think through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4822.432s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And then the second is, are we going to be working throughout the summer to increase hiring, especially at three schools where we have the 60 students in the after school program?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4834.357s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Because we did make a recommendation that we try to increase the other three schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4839.679s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I know the Brooks is at over 120.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4840.799s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I just want to make sure that's still in the works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4845.12s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 2020, 2021, 2022, we're hiring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4850.218s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: to hire, I know that, but I'm hoping we make some strides this summer to increase, get some of those children off the wait list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4859.159s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Member Reinfeldt?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4920.404s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That's great, yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4923.266s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And then just the funding source for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4926.609s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: If we had one team, it's $100,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4929.05s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: If we have two teams, it's $200,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5003.424s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Okay, yeah, that makes sense, because we'll be able to hopefully accept more children off the wait list, bringing in more funding to hopefully support at least a portion of this funding need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5015.092s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5016.013s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Is there a motion on the floor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5017.994s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Member Rousseau, then Member Ntapa?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5104.445s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you, Member Ntapa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5105.325s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I don't know if anybody has any response to that, but I'll go to Member Russo until<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5353.029s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Maybe you can elaborate then, Dr. Edward-Vincent, on what would the plan be if we had 12 students going into college or in college, and then that allowed us to bring in 100 more children to the afterschool program, what will we do the next year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5373.629s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: how would we explain it to families?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5376.269s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Or are we gonna be trying to hire starting June of 2025 to make sure we can maintain that level?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5678.303s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5679.224s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5680.484s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'm just finished my thought from the chair, and then I'm going to go to Member Bramley and then Member Reinfeld.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5686.406s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think, for me, I'd be a yes, because I think we have an after-school crisis, and I think it seems like a wonderful program, and of course, our teachers can be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5698.373s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: you support, and I think that we could bring in more revenue to be able to support this fee that is gonna be 100,000 for six people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5708.637s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I just know that as a committee, we've been asking for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5711.377s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: you know, several years to increase numbers at our, of the three afterschool programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5715.14s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I don't think we've increased it at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5717.341s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So that makes me concerned what it's either, we don't want to increase it at all, or we really can't, can still not hire to increase at that, those three schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5727.228s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And that would in turn, if it's the hiring piece, that is the issue, whether city is here for one, two or three years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5735.454s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I like that as a continued partnership, I just would have concerns for families just,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5740.589s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: not having that support and creating their lives around an after-school program and then only having it for a year or maybe two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5748.735s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So that's just a concern I have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5750.896s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: But member Brandley and member Reichelt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6266.588s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: You were gonna put the motion, I think, forward to table, so I'll go to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6423.111s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And yeah, and create a plan for how to maintain those, the levels that will be implemented next year.<br><br>

I put this before you,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6963.16s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: is it was something that's been talked about from when I was a city councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6967.521s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I believe the conversation started in the 2018 timeframe and it never fully moved forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6976.003s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So this is the way you have to accept it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6978.823s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Although, you know, I am happy to come before you with any, or I'm sure the school administration is as well with any specific requests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6987.722s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: First and foremost, I think this will help a great deal with facilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6992.143s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We want a big goal of mine, and I know it's part of the committee's goals, is to get routine maintenance in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7000.125s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We hope to have more funding soon to be able to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7004.387s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I think this, along with all the work that the negotiation team did,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7009.983s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: would go a very long way and make that happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7013.146s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So we have contracts set up and running to maintain our not-so-new schools anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7017.71s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So just ask for your approval on this paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7020.392s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We will keep you up to date on anything moving forward and happy to request a vote if need be, but definitely we'll keep you updated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7065.814s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: No, I understood it that once you accept this, it can be done, but it would have to come before the school committee for any type of budgetary vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7072.962s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So if this money is coming out of school monies, then yes, you'd have to vote for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7077.626s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'm not sure the city council would as well, unless it was coming out of city funding, then yes, it would have to be part of a budget or a supplemental budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7114.71s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I would expect tomorrow night that I would hope that they would approve this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7118.054s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I would expect to be paper that it would just be for facilities for now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7123.499s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And then we'd have to go before and this body can do the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7126.883s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And then if we wanna expand that, we can always take another vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7205.258s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That may be how some cities and towns handle it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7208.221s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I do not see that it would operate that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7211.964s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So for example, if you were gonna put<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7214.085s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: IT under one director fully, and then if you're going to say, yeah, do it with IT, I could see that being the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7223.091s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: But where we have a facilities maintenance director in the schools, we would just be putting somebody in charge to oversee, to help guide, to put the appropriate contracts into place, to help create a system and help<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7239.099s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: train and get that job done, especially if we're going to have an influx of potential monies that we want to be spent towards maintaining our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7247.605s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's a lot for one person to handle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7249.847s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And that person also oversees all the custodial work, from what I understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7254.89s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I feel like this would be an extra support and another level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7259.794s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I see it a little bit differently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7292.175s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Yeah, in this one case, I would,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7295.609s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: see that this director of facilities would still be a direct report to the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7301.876s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: If there's somebody overseeing that work, that could also be a second direct report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7309.464s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7311.666s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Member Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7394.947s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think that's absolutely fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7398.609s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It just has to be a B paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7400.169s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: From what I understand, this language has to be adopted as is, but you can absolutely do a B paper to make those restrictions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7455.916s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: and that would allow us to know this, in general, this is supported, especially with, say, facilities, and allow us to build that plan to bring to the school committee for approval or denial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7492.109s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7492.369s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That's my motion motion for approval of the main paper and B paper by member Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5730.818s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think whether it's redistricting or other options, there are things being explored behind the scenes, I know by admin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5737.984s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I'm sure you're creating a plan and we're gonna bring that to us, whether it be redistricting or X, Y, and Z, because something obviously needs to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5748.171s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: This has been an issue for several years, the Roberts that I'm aware of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6781.923s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6795.774s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And then before I call for a second, if we could just make sure that the purchase and either a short description and the price tag is on the agenda, just so we aren't referring back and forth, because I'm going with an electronic copy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6813.708s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That would be very helpful for the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6825.126s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6914.15s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I don't feel comfortable moving forward with it until we're transparently putting it on an agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6919.752s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Because report on operations, I don't think covers it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6922.553s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That's just my opinion from the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6924.713s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Member Rousseau, and then, oh, I'm sorry, I don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6928.314s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Member Reinfeldt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7035.7s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So motion to table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7041.263s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I don't even, it's not even on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7043.565s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So there's, I can withdraw it and maybe withdraw it and then just make sure it's very transparent on the, on the agenda for our next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7050.489s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That would be very appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7053.591s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7318.552s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7322.165s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Hold on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7325.286s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Moving on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7325.866s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And while you're looking for your next item, maybe a thought process before the next meeting on the parking spot issue is teens, high school students paying for a spot so they can decorate and have their own.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7341.091s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7341.931s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Just to think a little bit more creatively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7346.873s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: On to the next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7574.25s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: through the chair did they say how long it's going to take to train that they're in bus drivers are in training do they say how long it's going to take for medford to get two more<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7703.049s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And then just thank you, Dr. Edward Vincent, just to follow up the training that the current personnel are in now, is that a two week training?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7711.049s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Is that a four week training?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7772.014s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: if somebody wants to make a motion, I think since we're not paying for the two buses that we budgeted for, as we hear of overcrowding issues, because like Dr. Cushing said, we're not gonna make kids walk home in a dangerous situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7788.877s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Can we make sure that there's a monitor on those buses with that funding until these two additional ones come online so that we don't have any, so nobody gets hurt and there's no liability on the city and schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7881.13s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7882.571s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Member Russo, and then we may have a parent that wants to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8149.753s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you, Member Rousseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8150.853s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8152.274s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Member Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8559.771s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Just come on up and give your name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8563.213s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8641.096s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Yep, I think there's been a lot of activity on social media, so we're trying to calm people down because that messaging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8651.119s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I mean, I don't know if the admin has an answer, but 1.9 miles, I...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8654.97s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: think we're going to be excluding anybody from the bus but i'm not going to speak for yeah that's what i got out<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8743.102s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So we hear you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8773.894s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: No bus stops have changed and nobody's there checking your address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8777.576s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I think there probably needs to be some follow-up messaging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8821.7s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: maybe the first set of messaging should have been, you know, we're experiencing overcrowding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8826.444s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And if you're a capable of taking your child, especially if you live more than two, two miles away, please do so while we, uh, bus drivers are getting trained and we're trying to get two more buses online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8837.452s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So hopefully the admins all here, they heard, heard you loud and clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8906.449s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It was good to hear a real life experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8910.313s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I think from this, you put your child on the bus tomorrow and hopefully some more messaging will go out, especially to the area where you live.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8920.041s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Okay, all right, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8922.904s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Do we have another comment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8924.125s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Dr. Cushing, one more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8957.734s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=847.144s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you, President Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=848.445s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I want to thank Councilor Marks for putting this on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=851.306s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Councilor Caravaglio, Marks, and I were at that meeting, the police meeting, community meeting, and we spoke an hour, you know, we got updates on the South Medford shooting,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=863.103s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: The next most spoken about subject was the graffiti and how it's an eyesore, how Somerville is getting tough on their graffiti.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=871.89s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So it's bringing more down, especially in the South Medford area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=875.453s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: But there's people also complaining about it in West Medford, in Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=880.797s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It is everywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=881.578s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I mean, people are tagging for fun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=883.539s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: People are tagging to break the rules, break the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=887.543s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I think if Somerville's getting tough on it, I think it's time Medford does too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=893.322s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: put on the agenda and try to get certain spots cleaned up, but I think an ordinance creating a revolving account is a great way to do it, so I thank Councillor Marks for putting this on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=907.012s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I definitely am in favour of the paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=908.993s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think we need to stop the repeat tagging and just the fact that it's everywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=916.719s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think we should spend a portion of the money that comes into the revolving account, not only to clean up the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=923.561s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: like we spoke about last week, on cameras so that we can catch these offenders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=928.442s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We can catch them, we can find them, and we can make that revolving account, clean up all the graffiti within our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=935.164s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I would hope that some of that money would go to be spent on cameras.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=939.826s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I also wanted to just, Councilman Marks brought up Citizen Connect smartphone, and I know it goes along with the 311 system that Somerville uses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=950.329s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I happen to be in Somerville today, and they are giving out magnets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=954.295s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: with regards to if it's not an emergency and you need us or any other city service, you call 311.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=960.058s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I brought this up maybe four or five months ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=963.759s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We voted 7-0 to get this installed in Medford, this program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=969.542s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It will provide accountability and it's something that our residents deserve because I'm sure we're all sick of saying, hearing, when is my sidewalk gonna get fixed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=979.427s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: When is my street pothole gonna be repaved?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=982.327s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: all the DPW, you know, they'll say it's going to be done, or you're on the list, especially with sidewalk repairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=989.651s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: You're on the list, you're on the list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=991.392s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We really don't know what happens with that list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=993.793s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: This is a way for accountability, for response, and for action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=998.075s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So again, I'm going to see if I can amend your paper council marks and again vote that City of Medford implement the 311 program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1006.36s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think it's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1007.856s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: an absolute great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1009.616s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I've spoken to people in the building department at the city of Somerville, and they don't know what they would do without it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1016.278s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I think it's time for Medford to become accountable for all the complaints that come in, issues and concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1023.479s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So thank you again, Councilor Marks, and I'd like to amend the paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=1027.12s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4499.38s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you, President Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4500.901s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I echo the sentiment of my councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4503.063s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I believe a dog park, and I've said it before, is needed in this community, especially since we've raised money and had fundraisers for it, and there's money sitting there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4512.812s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I did have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4513.813s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I know that there's petitions going around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4516.175s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I saw that SMARTO, the South Medford<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4519.8s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: neighborhood group has sent petitions out, so I ask Councillor Marks, are they going to be in any businesses?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4524.442s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Where can people go to sign a petition?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4527.003s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Maybe we should, I know you're working on the petition, but how can people get out that you really don't know, aren't in the SMARTO email list?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4537.086s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: How can we get the people out to sign petitions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4539.367s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: This is a good question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4596.145s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4596.745s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8332.904s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Just briefly, thank you, President Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8335.446s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Gene, I agree with you on the community policing and getting back to the community policing, which we used to do years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8342.911s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I agree with you on that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8344.232s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I know that the chief of police is going to have the first walk in South Medford with the neighbors sometime, I think, late next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8353.174s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: council recommendation and that's a start and hopefully he does that within the different neighborhoods in the community as a start back to going back to community policing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8362.139s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8644.052s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Just a quick announcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8645.233s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8645.673s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you, President Camuso.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8647.034s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I know it's late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8649.015s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We had discussed last week, I brought a, put a resolution on the agenda with regards to our housing authorities being hooked up with FIOS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8656.981s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I know I got complaints about Tamponi Manor not having FIOS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8660.624s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So we did receive a resolve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8662.645s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I know two people that did complain to me, watched the council meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8666.508s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So if I could just read it, I was recently, this is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8670.157s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: From John Coddington, Medford Housing Authority to the Mayor's Office, who thankfully forwarded to us the email reads, I was recently approached by the firm hired by Verizon and charged with wiring the city for Fios.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8684.031s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: He sent us some material and I had staff meet with him yesterday about the possibility of wiring our nine MHA public housing sites.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8693.57s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We, as in John Coddington, now plan to visit the Malden Housing Authority to see the quality of their installation work and to talk with them about their experience with the whole process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8703.133s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: If things look acceptable, the next step would be to have the engineers come up with a scope of work and a plan for wiring our 845 apartments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8712.537s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: They indicated they would like everything worked out by the end of the year, so the actual site work could be completed in 2015.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8719.639s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'm thinking we'll know more within the next four to six weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8722.54s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I hope this information helps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8724.36s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So the 845 units within the Medford Housing Authority, just wanna confirm that Verizon, hopefully Verizon will be installed in 2015 and Mr. Coddington is working on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8736.644s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I thank the mayor's office again for getting us a response on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=0.089s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: reports of subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1758.397s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think the city does one or two locations in each school per year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1767.205s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So nothing extensive like what Water Smart has done for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1837.337s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So yes, anything our water department Mr Sousa, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=1842.622s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Received results.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2083.526s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It showed that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2102.009s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: facilities and grounds director from the city was notified of this probably beginning of last week, the week before, and immediately took action to start testing the fixtures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2114.755s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So we've got replacement fixtures, and we're going to be retesting those locations that we're going to test out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2121.039s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So we don't know the cause of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2123.92s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: yet of why we have lead in our new schools that were built far after 1988, but we are working to get to the bottom of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=678.018s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Councillor Kelly gave a great explanation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=680.84s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I don't know how much more you want to hear from me, but I'm sure there will be a number of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=684.863s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'm here to support loud questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=688.246s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think question six and question seven are the most important to me to raise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=695.593s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We've been working on a new environment for us for years, and I think it's essential that we now is the time to be able to go to the final design, go to bid, and construct that new building for our staff and our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=712.606s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And question seven especially,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=716.108s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I've done a video, I've done four videos, they're all on social media, and then I'll be more lengthy than I'll speak tonight, but question seven, 500,000, and that is to hire a completely separate DPW crew who can just work on our streets and our sidewalks, fill potholes, patchwork, and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=737.526s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Perhaps seal our roads, which Councilor Calderon mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=740.807s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Let's do the preventive maintenance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=742.888s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And we are actively trying to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=744.789s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We have an amazing DPW director, an amazing city engineer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=749.051s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: They are working so hard with the funding and manpower.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=752.552s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's just not fully there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=755.213s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So to have a center through,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=757.034s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: to tackle one of the largest issues that I hear about all the time, my street, my sidewalk, it's unsafe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=763.959s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I just busted a tire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=765.701s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: To be able to do that and to put $500,004 just to get back down to the city is essential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=772.706s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Schools, whether it's two, three, four, $500,004 just to put towards preventive maintenance and maintenance that we should already be doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=783.494s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We just don't have the funding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=785.555s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And we finally now have somebody on the city side for the first time ever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=790.406s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's our first facilities maintenance director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=793.372s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: He's actually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=795.015s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: involved in the school department, banks, and so has our director of planning and development and sustainability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=802.177s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: They're helping the schools make sure that we are getting work done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=806.559s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Biggest for me is we made sure this year that our security cameras are all functioning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=812.341s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We made sure that all of the door locks have been changed, so now we know who has<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=817.406s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We had lights that were running out, there was no lighting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=821.79s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: These are the projects that we are working on to maintain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=834.961s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And we've never had, it's like we do now on the city side, but on the school side, we still don't have those routine maintenance yearly checks, write-in checks of our systems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=848.044s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We've let our HR get so bad in the last 20 years on our political school loan that it's costing us over a million dollars for an OPM and architect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=858.907s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And it's almost $20 million to get AC and HVAC just to those two schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=864.03s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: They were built at the same time as our other non-federal schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=869.953s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That's just the HVAC, VRM, et cetera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=873.835s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So to be able to put in several hundred thousand dollars to do routine maintenance and annual maintenance of our schools is essential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=882.739s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We need to do it to prevent the bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=885.22s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We can't let that, we can't go on like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=889.606s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We just can't, especially when we have residents who are saying, please help fund our school, fund our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=900.519s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: and putting it to a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=901.48s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: You know, there are people that I know can't afford it, and I've said in my videos, and I'll say tonight, there are exceptions out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=908.104s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Our assessors have an online paper copies in our assessor's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=912.687s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We have a calculator on our city website that will tell you how this will affect you and what options there are for you if there are exemptions and exclusions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=921.792s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So there are ways, and the biggest part of that question seven is current personnel in our State Department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=930.538s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Now we did, we'll say do the hard work, you're not managing right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=933.542s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Remember Graham and I, and the school committee, and the superintendent, and our finance staff, we did the hard, we did some very hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=941.433s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We got two to three million dollars from our school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=946.48s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We want the taxpayers to let us know, do you want us to do it again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=949.941s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Because we're going to have to cut at least $2 million in staff on the school side, but it's also going to take things up on the city side, because I prioritize our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=960.505s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And there are going to be some tough budget meetings moving forward if question seven doesn't pass, because I'll be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=968.042s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I mean, we're talking meetings going over budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=973.065s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's like, please level the bottom as much as you can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=977.428s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We're already talking about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=984.632s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's not mismanagement, it's the fact that school costs, which is the largest piece of this puzzle, is up at least 8% across the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1003.24s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We can't cut homeless transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1005.222s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That's about $500,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1005.622s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Jenny probably knows the numbers better than I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1009.146s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We cannot cut certain things that are essential in our school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1013.711s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Homeless transportation, transportation, special ed costs, they can't be cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1017.896s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So our cuts are coming from people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1019.177s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Our cuts are going straight to the classroom, straight to the mental health supports, the guidance counselors, people that are needed for our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1026.044s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Since COVID it's been extremely tough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1028.707s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Our children are struggling and knowing that we did the hard work and we made the adjustments and we changed what I felt needed to be changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1037.735s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I worked with the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1038.996s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I worked with the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1040.517s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We passed a budget and we came up with this plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1043.34s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We worked together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1044.441s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's been very, very transparent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1047.163s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Everything we've done, we've laid out in press releases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1049.264s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think there's about four up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1051.306s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We're doing videos.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1055.049s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We want you to have the right to vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1057.911s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Yes or no?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1059.072s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I had one of those questions split, because I do know there's some people that can't afford it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1064.595s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So question six is in required headquarters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1068.557s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That's a debt exclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1070.158s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Once that debt's paid off, that will fall off your due taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1073.941s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So yes, it passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1075.682s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Question seven, you spoke about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1077.703s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And then question eight, I too would love to be able to work towards our goals, which was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1085.107s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: better high school and vocational schedule and get our children in the classroom a little longer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1089.27s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Now that needs to be negotiated, so we won't go into depth about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1092.833s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That will happen at the negotiation table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1095.355s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Without that funding, that won't be possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1098.237s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That will not be possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1099.638s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So now's the time for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1102.34s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Some cities and towns do overrides quite often.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1105.281s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We've never done it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1107.741s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: In support of these override questions, I'll be voting yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1110.382s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I just ask that you do your homework.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1111.902s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I ask that you keep an open mind and really just think about it, especially how it will affect you and your family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1121.584s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I understand that this is both of the people of my burden.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1125.845s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I hope they're successful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1346.541s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Now, to therefore, what does that mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1351.484s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1352.605s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Like I said, I've done a pre-cash video, and then on the city side, we just put out a diagram of city needs, what would that be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1361.694s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 100% open spend of free cash on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1364.055s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It just outlines the needs in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1366.916s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We have over 100 million in backlog on our streets and sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1372.138s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We're putting out a press release this week with regards to 10,000 homes that will get a letter in November letting them know they either have landlines into their home or that they're an unknown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1388.806s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That's going to be upwards of a hundred plus million dollars for the city to fix those lead mines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1396.212s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So there you have over $200,000 million, $200 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1401.556s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Then you also have a large issue with water and sewer infrastructure,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1408.681s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: put in over 420 years ago, that is probably several hundred million dollars to do our water and sewer infrastructure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1417.528s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So between the lead that needs to be, the new federal guidelines say we need to take care of this lead line issue over the next eight to ten years, we have to fix our streets and sidewalks, and we have to fix our water and sewer infrastructure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1432.139s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That alone is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1434.043s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: $400 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1435.665s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Then we have in the pocket, right here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1441.269s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: several million in different buckets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1443.19s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: One, like Councilor Callahan said, is five million into a stabilization account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1447.752s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That is our emergency fund, and that is important to have in case some large project, like a new roof, needs to get done anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1457.577s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Then we put, that included, we put six million into that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1460.378s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Five million went into a capital improvement stabilization account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1464.34s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So that was five million, it was our first,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1468.095s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: First stabilization comes ever, and as of July 1st, we either had projects go over in cost, or we've had emergencies of about $1.2 million, just from July 1st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1483.065s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That includes the Brooks School hot water heater, the blue, that was a couple hundred thousand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1490.57s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We had,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1492.991s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So that was a water feeder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1495.332s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We had road safety, traffic safety improvements at Central and Spring Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1500.075s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That project was over $250,000 that we needed to spend money on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1505.517s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Today, there was another request for a grant match, for an MVP grant match of $35,000, and the list goes on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1513.341s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So in just a matter of a few months, we needed to spend $1.1 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1518.244s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That account is down to $3.9.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1520.945s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And that just goes to show the emergencies and the overages and the cost of things that we need to get done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1526.829s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We have a capital improvement plan that you can also access on our website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1530.871s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That has us spending millions of dollars a year just on equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1535.914s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: DBW, police cruisers, fire trucks, and the list goes on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1542.498s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So please take a look at our capital improvement plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1545.04s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's a six-year plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1546.921s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We've, Collin Center helped us with that plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1551.089s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: the most professional planning efforts ever had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1553.352s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So we had one that was done in 2021, and we just re-updated it two years later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1560.219s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So that's on our website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1712.436s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1713.156s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We averaged over the last couple decades, we've averaged anywhere from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1719.371s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: one to one and a half million in new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1722.994s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: This past fiscal year, we brought that up, that number up to 2.5 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1727.937s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So we are growing in new growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1731.36s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We've doubled the size of our planning department, thankfully, which is planning, development, and sustainability, and we have our first ever economic development director who's trying to bring in new business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1742.968s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And we've been working extremely hard on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1746.19s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: a number of projects that are in the works, and a number of projects that are coming in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1751.413s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So, we are doing well with regrowth, but we're always looking to expand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1755.435s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think we've, you should correct me if I'm wrong, but we had<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1761.308s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: five or six life science facilities that were ready to move forward, and that market kind of fell apart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1770.615s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I started asking developers to bring life science to Medford right when I became mayor in 2020, and at that time it was too late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1779.942s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So we are,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=1781.523s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We're trying to get the tech industry, we're trying to get multi, we just put an RFP out for our three lots in Medford Square, that's gonna be mixed use, affordable housing, commercial, so we are doing everything we can, we're gonna have the space above the well into the air rights, and we're moving, but it just takes time, so you see a lot of development now, but you see more and more as the years go by.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2007.386s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: it was likely to be a 30-year loan for $30 million to build a new high school, and that wouldn't hit, fire station, I'm sorry, fire station, and that wouldn't hit our tax rolls this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2021.029s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That would be next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2024.589s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: In debt exclusion, yes, we're asking for 30 million for a new headquarters, and the question was the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2048.573s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2048.973s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Back when I was on the city council, there was a proposal that was put before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2053.236s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It was actually no community involvement, no involvement from anybody that I'm aware of except the chief of police at the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2060.061s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And it was just put before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2061.662s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It was a design of a new police headquarters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2065.425s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And at the time, as a city councilor, I just asked that we take<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2068.8s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: a couple months to explore a combined station, a fire and a police station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2073.742s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Combined station would save us money in the long run.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2076.703s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That didn't happen, so once I became mayor, obviously as I was campaigning, I made it a central issue to make sure that we also take a look at our fire headquarters and all of our fire buildings, there's six of them, and we put the work in that needs to be put in to make the living environment and the work environment a better place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2097.512s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So since that time, I commissioned a task force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2101.113s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We have put millions of dollars into the five substations, windows, roofs, new kitchens, and the list goes on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2109.336s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I also tasked my chief of staff, who is my trade and engineer, to lead that project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2116.739s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So she's been working on the EnviroHeadquarters for about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2120.9s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: over two years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2122.541s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I've kind of taken a step back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2124.723s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I have other things to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2125.703s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: There's a long list, so we divide and conquer, but she led that chapter with the prior fire chief and the current fire chief, and we've created a plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2136.791s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Right now, it's still in concept design.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2138.532s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's hopefully going into final design, especially if this vote passes, and we're working towards it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2149.36s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: for a building that's 70 years old that needs a lot of work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2153.702s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's the same problems that we have in the police station from ventilation to rodents to windows that need to be replaced and living quarters that need to be better maintained and updated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2169.904s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And the list goes on, and it's an old building, and our department and our city deserves better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2175.732s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So it's debt exclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2177.634s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We chose to go debt exclusion because you can bond multiple ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2182.28s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: One is through debt exclusion, and that is the extra tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2185.724s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Or you can put it on the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2189.506s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: You can put the debt on the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2192.527s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: But in my mind, if you're paying hundreds of thousands of dollars on your bond each year for our headquarters that we could have a debt exclusion on, in my mind, you're taking money away from our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2203.913s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And we just can't afford that right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2206.894s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We haven't been able to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2208.275s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I think this is the much better route.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2211.577s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So what will happen if this doesn't pass?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2214.58s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: They don't know how long we would build.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2471.383s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2472.343s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'll just get into the last piece a bit because although<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2477.381s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'm one member of the school committee, and Member Graham's one member, it's seven members have to vote on something, and the superintendent and the finance director create the budget, obviously with our help and advice and discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2491.533s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We're pretty clear, this is two million, question seven is two million in personnel, it's Chromebooks for our students, it's maintenance for our buildings, and it's a DPW crew.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2503.678s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Now, will the superintendent want to take $50,000 from the maintenance to help with busing or special ed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2512.141s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That's going to be, obviously, the prerogative of the superintendent and finance director, but we are not going to go cut positions to fund something else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2521.203s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We're being as clear as possible, knowing that, obviously, things will live.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2526.885s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And with question eight, it's going to cost at least that or more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2531.047s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: to extend the school day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2532.688s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We're not spending it another way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2534.65s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And the debt exclusion is the debt exclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2537.232s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I don't buy the argument that we're just going to go into the general fund and we're going to spend it on X, Y, and Z. We work very hard, member Graham and I, and Councilor Callahan as well, to balance the budget, to know the needs,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2553.999s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: You know, that's what the taxpayers want us to do, and we do it every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2558.18s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Now, we don't have full control of the schools, but we spend a lot of time, we spend a lot of time on that area, and I'm doing it on the city side, and it's the first time the city's had human resources in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2570.103s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: There was no human resources in the city of Medford until four years ago when I became mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2574.764s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So, holding people accountable, making sure your tax dollars are spent the right way, we're doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2579.865s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's not perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2580.845s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: believe me, I'm starting to look at the parking revenue, I'm looking at overtime, I'm looking at sick time, I'm doing it every day, and so is in Denver right now, both of us on the school side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=2592.491s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So this money is going to our children, one way or another, it's our priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3201.049s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We have an application in for the EAP for lead pipe repair, but we don't have, we don't know if we'll get that for another month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3215.699s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's not guaranteed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3216.76s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Yeah, the EAP grant is, we don't know yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3219.482s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It will be another month, and if we do get the grant, it will be, well, one-sixth of the need, or just above lead issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3225.786s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Okay, so just so fan-day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3229.667s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3230.788s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's a substantial amount of money, but when you're talking 100 plus million dollars in replacement that we need to do, the 20 million grant that we applied for through the EPA, we'll just touch a fraction of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3243.457s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3835.373s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: What is set is a piece of land that we have to build the fire station on, which is a very difficult piece of property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3843.256s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's configured in a way, especially the curb cuts and the structure of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3850.078s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think what is set is a 22,000 or so square foot building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3856.499s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We're trying to do 20 to 25,000 construction costs, and then obviously we need<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3861.872s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: contingencies and additional funding for it to get finalized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3867.634s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: What is also set is that we heard from the department and we heard from the current fire chief the position of the building, and that is not how other department heads of the city felt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3881.059s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It was a position where I was left, and I told you I stayed out of the process, but it was a position where I said, okay, traffic and transportation wants this,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3890.816s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: planning, things that should go with this, engineering, DPW, they were all involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3895.278s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And our fire chief said, actually for our department and our members, and the safety of exiting that parcel, this is the way the building needs to be positioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3906.624s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And that's when I took a stand and said, we're gonna do what the fire department wants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3911.467s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'm sorry to those department heads that weren't happy with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3914.568s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: But those are the things that are definite.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3916.73s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Now it's a concept design, so things can definitely be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3919.631s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: be tweaked and changed just like we've done over the last several months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3922.778s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We've added more storage space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3924.702s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We've changed bunk space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3926.786s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I did put a training tower in the design because I've heard loud and clear that the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3931.727s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: training tower was a request of our department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3935.249s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That was put in writing that the union would like to take that out in return for more bunk space, so we took the tower out, there's more bunk space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3944.772s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It is not perfect, I'm not 100% happy, our planning director is not 100% happy, fire chief's not 100% happy, the list goes on, but it's gonna be a brand new building for our department, and final design will come after this building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4330.353s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We do have a lot of supports for those who are struggling to pay rent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4335.154s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Most of that is funded through our community development block grant funding, our CPA funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4340.355s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We did a round of funding to non-profits with our federal funds, APA money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4346.016s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I think that is the avenue, more so than free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4352.977s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I don't know if I was able to discuss it, but a number of different funding sources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4556.658s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We actually, the law says what we can and cannot spend public funds on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4561.799s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So we do have a webpage that outlines this quite a bit, but anything public safety related especially, we can use public funds on private and public ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4571.542s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So we do fill potholes, for instance, or tree branches that are in the middle of any public or private way, we'll get taken care of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4581.724s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Since Tim came on board and Owen came on board, we do follow the laws as it relates to private and public ways, and it is very frustrating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6569.218s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you for allowing me to read that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6573.058s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I just to further point out, I meet with our city DEI director quite frequently and over the last, especially several months, if not close to a year,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6586.018s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: the conversation is about obviously city departments, but it's a lot about the school department and all the support she's providing to the school, Frances Wajai.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6594.842s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I put this resolution together to highlight that for the committee, because especially the last, like I said, several months, it's more and more about the support that our DEI director is giving to the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6606.008s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I felt that the school committee should not only be aware, but vote for this to continue and obviously compensate accordingly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6616.462s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I'd ask for support of the motion and so that the continued relationship and collaboration and work that Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6626.206s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Wojcicki is doing for our schools, as well as of course our city continues, as I'm very happy that she's able to support our superintendent, HR and other departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6637.632s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So I'd ask for your support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6679.612s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you, Member Reinfeldt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6680.535s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Member Olopade?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7081.228s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Member Ntapa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7126.658s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: If she's willing to add to this list, I'm sure she is willing, and I know she's lent her expertise and is trying to help, especially HR, as much as she can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7137.648s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: But if she completely ceases doing this work, other than the ADA work, there's going to be a huge, huge gap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7145.916s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: in our school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7147.016s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I don't know if the superintendent or any of the administration wants to speak on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7153.638s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: One suggestion is if anybody wants to add anything, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7156.418s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: If you want to make it temporary or review it within six months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7161.98s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: But there's support that Frances has given on a daily basis that, frankly, the schools need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7170.081s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: She has decades of experience and I don't think we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7173.086s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I don't think the city's ever had that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7175.988s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'm not sure if the school has ever had somebody with 30 years experience like this, who's moving the district along and helping however she can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7216.975s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7217.855s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Let Dr. Edward Vincent speak and then Member Olopade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7287.298s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7288.079s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you, Dr Edward Vincent member of the party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7338.089s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think a subcommittee meeting's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7340.051s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I would just ask for support on the resolution to continue this work tomorrow because, like the superintendent said, this list is extensive and the work she's doing in the schools cannot be ignored.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7352.601s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And it will, I'll say it again, it's a huge gap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7358.586s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: We're in meetings talking about school raises constantly and what we do on the city side is 2% for non-union.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7369.198s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'm kind of a little, I struggle with city side employees, non-union taking on extra workloads in general, but especially when I ask for a list and it's this extensive after hearing repeated day after day, week after week on all that this one department head is doing for the schools, I think it's necessary to compensate her for such.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7396.86s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I think it's completely fine<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7399.375s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: to have a subcommittee meeting and discuss it at our next December 16th regular meeting, but that's a month away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7407.296s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I think that's gonna create a huge gap for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7410.577s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I just, this is an individual working very hard to help the schools and the message it would send to not move this forward tonight, even if it's just on a temporary basis or with a month, two, three, six month review,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7429.133s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: respectfully ask my colleagues to try to do both at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7538.143s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7539.263s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Is there a second on that motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7561.18s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Is there a second on the amendment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7580.742s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: that was not necessarily authorized by me too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7583.704s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: It's just how it's happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7585.825s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think when somebody has a knowledge base and is lending support, it's just.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7599.414s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Dr. Edward-Vincent, this is work all currently taking place as far as I'm aware.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7672.759s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7692.772s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: With the building and grounds consolidation, there is a small $7,500 stipend that HR<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7701.776s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: you know, did through evaluations, and the school district is paying for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7708.101s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: So we're not talking a large amount of money, but just a stipend to compensate for all the work and hours that are put into this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7720.01s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: That was building and grounds, that's annual, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7863.111s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: And I, to be honest, would have asked HR from this past, I'd asked both HR departments to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7870.595s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: evaluate that and see if it's the same as facilities maintenance or if it should be more or less.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7875.619s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I don't have that answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7878.601s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I would assume it would be similar, but I don't have that answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7881.543s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I'm not in HR to do the proper evaluations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8005.645s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I completely agree with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8009.769s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: I think because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8012.042s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Francis knows, and it's called upon to help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8015.544s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: She's going to help, however.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8142.47s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Okay, and then the subcommittee will meet to discuss and meet with Director Wajeh, and we can take it up at our December 16th meeting with potentially amended language, timeframes, things like that, whatever the committee decides.<br><br>
