    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=779.15s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=782.03s">[Reinfeld]</a>: No, my question is how this intersects with the building and grounds subcommittee, but I think your question was more directly related to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=943.683s">[Reinfeld]</a>: No, that makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=944.364s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So the other thing I was going to say, when you said it's time for the school to take this back and make the decision, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=949.587s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But I think we need to build into whatever our procedure is, a regular like report out according to the city or according because we need to be in their plan in their capital planning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=961.716s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1011.466s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Their presentation is not intended to be at that level of detail, which is why I like what they're doing, you know, they're turning all municipal roofs to solar right like we want in on that we've got a part of that right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1249.095s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1249.815s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=3046.488s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is it worth making a presentation on this to the MSBA building committee or not yet or, or, I mean, I know, I know, I know that she did the podcast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=78.215s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=79.376s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Russo?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=81.604s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld, present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=83.066s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Three, present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=84.328s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Zero, absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=85.47s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And we are joined by members of the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=89.976s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I believe some members of the public as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=91.939s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you all so much for coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=94.702s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So this is the follow up on the resolution<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=98.027s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I don't actually have the resolution number in front of me, but be it resolved that the Subcommittee for Curriculum Instruction, Assessment, and Accountability meet with the Assistant Superintendent of Academics and Instruction and other relevant staff to discuss the development of a process to review and assess recently adopted curricula and assessment tools across the district and to identify the key stakeholders, timelines, and protocols to be involved in these reviews consistent with the policies described in Section<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=125.651s">[Reinfeld]</a>: of the Medford School Committee Online Policy Manual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=130.302s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So by way of context, we've called this meeting because in recent years, the Medford Public Schools have adopted a number of new curricular materials through a robust process of review and input and stakeholder input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=144.573s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And we would like to have the ability to assess whether our goals for adopting those materials are being achieved and what that looks like in terms of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=155.582s">[Reinfeld]</a>: the materials themselves, as well as the instruction and the student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=159.325s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And by way of further context, in the Medford Public Schools strategic plan, item A1 is to establish an ongoing process of curriculum review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=170.511s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I'm happy to pull up that document with the details of that, but I've asked Dr. Galluzzi to give us an update on where we are, because phase one<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=180.217s">[Reinfeld]</a>: is slated for 2021 through 2024 and here we are in 2024 and we'd like to get ahead of the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=188.243s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I think if we start with an update on phase one and then discuss what phase two looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=194.887s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is it useful to say who's in the room here from the schools before we do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=256.823s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Hi there, Jennifer Skane, Principal of Andrews Middle School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=447.49s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I don't think we should dive deep, but just to get a sense of what that looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1210.359s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Russo, did you have any questions, particularly as someone who's seen a lot of these curricula come in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1218.249s">[Reinfeld]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1218.75s">[Reinfeld]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1219.151s">[Reinfeld]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1221.437s">[Reinfeld]</a>: All right, so I think what we want to do, so this gives us a really good foundation for what's been done, what's in progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1228.499s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think one of the goals in calling this subcommittee at this point in time is to say, so some of these things are due to be evaluated regularly, and that process is in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1242.482s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But one of the things I want to be really thoughtful about is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1247.784s">[Reinfeld]</a>: that there are a few different stages of assessing these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1250.507s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I know this is ridiculous for me to say with this many educators on the call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1257.273s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But one of the things that I've been thinking about in regards to this is that didactic triangle where the content is one piece of a triangle and the students and the teachers are the other points and assessing the content.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1271.227s">[Reinfeld]</a>: isn't just about the content itself, but it's about the relationship that that content has to the teachers and the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1277.935s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think the review process isn't necessarily a conversation about the teacher-student relationship, but it is to the content and the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1286.424s">[Reinfeld]</a>: into the teachers and the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1288.046s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And so some of that looks like, for the content and the teachers, that looks like the implementation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1293.631s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And is this doing, is this working?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1297.474s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Are these things being implemented with fidelity and in a way that the teachers are adequately trained to teach this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1304.16s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then that seems to me something that needs to come earlier than the process of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1310.666s">[Reinfeld]</a>: assessing whether the students have mastery of the content or whether they're in well hopefully the engagement with the content is coming sooner and to be able to assess that through observations through test scores whatever it is and what that process looks like so it's not just we're looking at everything all together once we hit<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1330.25s">[Reinfeld]</a>: the six years or the curriculum expires in 2029.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1332.912s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So we're just deciding if we're gonna renew it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1336.633s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'd like to make sure that we have a process in place to review that in a strategic targeted way at selected points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1344.938s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And you all on the call know far better than I do what is feasible, because as we all know, the more time you spend talking to people about what they're doing, that's less time that they're actually doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1355.803s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So figuring out what that balance is, is something that I'd like to kind of lay out in terms of the timeline, who the stakeholders are, and the role that different people are going to be playing in a review process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1539.375s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1539.535s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I would love to hear from the folks on the ground there as you know, is, is map testing giving you the information you need and what other information do you need?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1549.138s">[Reinfeld]</a>: What are, what are the ways to get that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1550.798s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Because I think as we all know, we, we don't all want it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1554.88s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We don't want to just make test scores the measure of success.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1558.401s">[Reinfeld]</a>: What are the, what are the metrics we need here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1879.366s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I just don't want to lose sight of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1881.187s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So the scope of this meeting is about assessing the curricula, not necessarily student gains.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1886.068s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Obviously, part of the goal of these curricula is to reflect student gains, but to make sure that we're measuring something that tells us whether the goals of adopting a given curriculum are being met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1898.172s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But I see hands in the air.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1899.672s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I think Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1900.312s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Demos was first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1906.912s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, did we lose her?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2089.123s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And sorry, Mr. Tixera, the list that we just saw from Dr. Galussi of the curricula, how many of those have the built-in ELA support?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2099.409s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I know it was included versus a separate curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2202.636s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2255.151s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2256.511s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That actually, if anyone else has comments, I welcome them, but that seems like a reasonable transition to identify.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2317.433s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2319.284s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And that speaks to the other kind of takeaway I wanted to get from this, which is the timeline of when that, it sounds like MAP provides a lot of flexibility for doing a lot of that in real time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2330.269s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And if that is embedded in the process, I don't know how much more explicit it needs to be, but I'm interested in kind of identifying who are the stakeholders in making those decisions and getting that input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2343.494s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I know when curricula is chosen, it's done with community input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2347.336s">[Reinfeld]</a>: from families, obviously a lot of, most of the folks in families are not educators or curriculum developers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2354.701s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So, but they can speak to the experiential component of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2360.245s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And of course, the teachers who are teaching it saying this is working, this is not working anecdotally, qualitatively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2367.611s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So identifying who those parties are and when they come into the review process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2374.556s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think would be a useful exercise for this call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2575.973s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Are there thoughts from the group on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2580.657s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And also giving some attention to non-MCAS subjects as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2586.602s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I know we've been talking about NWEA MAP, but a lot of the math and the literacy is baked into things where there's a little more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2599.684s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I don't want to say leeway in other programs, because it is they're absolutely rigorous and to standards, but how can we make sure that's being included in this process and that those programs are getting what they need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2728.479s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2728.919s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And that speaks to another question I had for this group, which is the cross-departmental influence, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2737.925s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I see Mr. Cieri is on the call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2740.506s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Do our students taking advanced science classes have the advanced math skills that they need to do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2747.17s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And what room in reviewing curricula saying,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2750.732s">[Reinfeld]</a>: The next grade is getting students are coming in with the knowledge that they need to succeed at this grade and with this curriculum or looking at across you know do a piece does the statistics department have the statistics students have these math skills or these critical thinking skills that come from a humanities program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2769.015s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And so I'm wondering what cross-curricular opportunities there are to say this is a program that speaks to multiple needs, and certainly at the elementary school level, foundational math, foundational reading, but being able to make those connections across areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2796.513s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Do either of you wanna?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2798.214s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And particularly in terms of being able to review curricula with that in mind, not just are the students getting these things, but.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2996.554s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And that taps into a question that we had brought up earlier of, is it the material?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3001.396s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is it the implementation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3002.597s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is it the instruction?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3003.878s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And really being able to assess it out, because we don't want to throw out a curriculum that has a lot of potential and would be doing well if there were more training.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3015.323s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But we also don't want to keep hammering away at a curriculum that isn't working.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3021.426s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I saw two hands go up, although one of them, I think, just went down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3178.263s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That's another great point that I think is not quite this meeting, but when a teacher brings a curriculum to the district and how that gets adopted and assessing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3191.83s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So that's a great point as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3195.132s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Nicole?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3307.877s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3308.317s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I think that was kind of the goal of this of getting this group together to have this conversation is to say, what does that process look like?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3317.342s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And what is the timeline for that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3321.104s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I don't know if that becomes a question with with the strategic plan for the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3326.267s">[Reinfeld]</a>: As we said, the phase one is coming to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3330.737s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Coming to an end this year and knowing what that phase two is, is something that I can speak for myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3339.422s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I hope the rest of the subcommittee agrees we'd like to know what, as we approach the end of phase one, what does phase two look like, who's involved, and what's the timeline?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3527.803s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3528.724s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm noting that it's six.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3529.845s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I would love to see this draft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3533.287s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3534.067s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But I do notice it is the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3536.229s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I think, especially in those instances where we're looking at, I don't want to call them Frankenstein curricula, but to say there's a gap in this published material that we need to supplement with either something homegrown or some other published material.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3713.991s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, although I will say I love the reasons for initiation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3716.832s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think that's really important to make explicit that some of it is scheduled, some of it is emerging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3725.036s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And some of it is external.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3729.258s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3732.079s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And do you have a target timeline for this process from adoption to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3743.024s">[Reinfeld]</a>: For these stages, you said we could spend a few years in implementation and monitoring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3748.325s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3818.155s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think it's five, my daughter was in second grade and my other one's in third now, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3847.861s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I don't think it's fully up to date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3850.385s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3857.915s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3858.195s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3858.335s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I think it's useful for this, if not the subcommittee or even the entire school committee to know when is it reasonable to say, all right, into readings been in place now, we need this up, we need an update on whether it's achieved its goals or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3873.287s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Cause I know school committee approves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3875.128s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We don't teach, we don't tell teachers how to teach, but we do approve major investments in curricula.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3881.512s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And so knowing when it's reasonable to see those updates, that data, those data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3892.016s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3893.917s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And so mapping out where those are for the various curricula.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3926.803s">[Reinfeld]</a>: have anything to add.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3928.484s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3929.824s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Anyone else have anything to add?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3931.325s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I know this was kind of a preliminary meeting, and it was for many of you laying out some of the things that you've been already working on for a couple of new school committee members, but it is very much appreciated, especially after hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3944.83s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Um member Brandly or member member Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3947.031s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Did you have any other<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3962.082s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3963.383s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I think I am.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3964.363s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3969.386s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I'm excited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3970.167s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm excited to see this, this next stage of the process laid out and to understand where we are with the various curricula so that we can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3979.502s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We can come to you when it is appropriate and not make extra work asking questions and when they're not, when the answer is forthcoming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3999.286s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=4001.466s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Brandly, Member Russo, is there- Can we go to a door?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=4009.371s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=4010.232s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is there a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=4011.733s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=4013.274s">[Reinfeld]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=4014.375s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Roll call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=4015.215s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Branley?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=4017.757s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=4019.158s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Russo?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=4021.08s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=4022.04s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=4022.641s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you all so much, and I look forward to continued conversation on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6128.574s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6191.823s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yep, I don't have a lot to share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6193.004s">[Reinfeld]</a>: This was really a foundational meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6194.406s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We had a great crowd of people who gave us an overview of what was happening and we're moving forward towards phase two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9344.116s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to waive this reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9363.169s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9365.21s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm wondering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9365.691s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9771.252s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to waive the definitions reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10573.524s">[Reinfeld]</a>: have another minor text.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10576.265s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think it was in section eight, part D. I can just send this to you, but to move that phrase to approve the proposed reconciled budget to after meeting, so special school committee meeting to approve the proposed reconciled budget will be scheduled no less than five business days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10597.751s">[Reinfeld]</a>: You stumbled over it when reading it the same way that I stumbled over it at home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10605.303s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I did have a question on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10609.106s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So you talk in phase two about discussing the budget needs with the principals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10613.949s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I was wondering about the department heads and potentially that's part of the presentations we get regularly from the departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10623.539s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I don't know if that's part of the budget process, or if it's part of the updates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10627.222s">[Reinfeld]</a>: This is what we've been doing, this is where we are, and this is what we anticipate needing for next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10631.486s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So build some of that strategic planning into those updates that we're already getting, or if not, make sure it's in the process of crafting the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10641.836s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think one of the big questions that people have had, that I've seen from people is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10648.737s">[Reinfeld]</a>: who exactly, how are we getting these numbers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10651.279s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Why are we, what is the plan for this department and that department and what are their needs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10656.262s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I know it's allocated by school and the principals are really important, but thinking about the departments and giving us a better sense of where those numbers and allocations are coming from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10666.849s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Because I think that also informs how we spend our money and what our priorities are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10826.19s">[Reinfeld]</a>: My question was how do we make transparent those priorities, not just in the individual schools, but across the areas, the department areas,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10961.706s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Then maybe what I'm asking is if that budget presentation can be tied more closely to the strategic plan and the direction that we're headed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11127.947s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11128.307s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I don't support doing the same work over and over, to be clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=2698.695s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5717.259s">[Reinfeld]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5718.881s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5721.958s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I was going to ask about targeted follow-up, because we know that response rates tend to be low among some of your invited populations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5729.943s">[Reinfeld]</a>: My other question is, how are you going to be measuring the success of the institute?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5734.806s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is it comparing the people who did it and didn't, who were all issued invitations?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5738.849s">[Reinfeld]</a>: How do we know that this program worked?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5837.55s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5919.105s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=6085.043s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'll amend my motion to include those dates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=121.79s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to enter executive session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3881.687s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3882.928s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I don't want to repeat the questions from Member Russo and Member Olopade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3888.072s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I do want to say I've worked with a number of programs in this sort of thing, and I have found that City Year is one of the more supportive, providing the support to employees than some of the other similar programs and even those as part of the AmeriCorps program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3904.203s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I found City Year to be really a solid<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3907.345s">[Reinfeld]</a>: partner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3907.745s">[Reinfeld]</a>: The question that I have maybe is for the administration more than you, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3914.331s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Roberts, it's around what this looks like in terms of planning coming into the school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3920.555s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think we've, anyone who has been in education or well really many, many jobs, it's not exclusive to education, has had a student teacher, an intern come in and that can often be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3930.683s">[Reinfeld]</a>: more work for the person supervising, obviously for great benefit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3934.546s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I really, really support programs that are teaching these skills and giving these community collaborations an opportunity to grow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3943.854s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So it's not about that, but what kind of foundation and conversations<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3949.398s">[Reinfeld]</a>: would we be having with the teachers and the administration in the schools, particularly noting that we are now in the summer period and many of the staff will be coming back right before school starts and moving in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3963.535s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So it's a question about onboarding and the commitment for what it looks like on the ground for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3969.321s">[Reinfeld]</a>: really being able to get this going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3972.064s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I appreciate what Member Olopade said, that this is an and, not an or, but even adding ands to the top of already very full jobs is a lot of work, and I'd love to hear about how that is managed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4088.277s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm sorry, the other part of that was making sure the teachers and support staff that are being worked with have the opportunity to express that this is our specific need in this specific year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4861.226s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, I could, I apologize, this might have been said already, but is the third, we're talking about an elementary school and a single classroom, is the third grade a fixed point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4873.29s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Because I think the schools that we're looking at, particularly the Mississippi is where we've had a lot of concerns about the average class size being a lot for a single teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4883.353s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And that's not necessarily in the third grade, for example, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4889.275s">[Reinfeld]</a>: What kind of, how does this intersect with our class size questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4895.439s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We're having another adult in the room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4914.793s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So it's not fixed for a particular grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5758.581s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Brandley, you're muted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5880.609s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yep, I think these are all really valid concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5883.011s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But I also think this is an opportunity to pilot what community partnership looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5887.835s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And that's something we should be doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5889.877s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That's a way forward in making Medford a great place to learn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5893.74s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And so I can hear concerns, maybe two programs is too much for a pilot, given the uncertainties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5900.166s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5902.645s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think this is something we can learn from, and it will lay a foundation for being able to have more partnership, more community support, training people to be in education and make a difference in students' lives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5915.669s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think it's a valuable pilot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7420.567s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So versus tabling the motion versus tabling this until we see that plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7521.285s">[Reinfeld]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8432.816s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, thank you, Mr. McHugh and everybody who contributed conversations both within the administration and within the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8441.603s">[Reinfeld]</a>: These were not easy conversations, and I appreciate the clarity of the story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8446.026s">[Reinfeld]</a>: One thing that this story doesn't tell that I think it's important to say on the floor in this meeting is that this whole process has revealed a lot of important conversations that need to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8459.096s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It has the potential cuts from the initial budget proposal have revealed the challenges in the high school schedule, the middle school schedule, the enrollment and distribution of students across the schools, particularly the elementary schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8474.603s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It's raised questions about the stipend rates and then the timing of the budget cycle itself and how it coincides with non-renewals and everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8484.748s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I think that is really important<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8486.989s">[Reinfeld]</a>: to keep in mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8488.37s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It's not immediately germane to the approval of the budget at hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8493.493s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But the one thing that I would like to do, I would like to make a motion that the school committee receive a report by December 7th describing the implementation and impact of the position reductions that were not related to enrollment, just to understand how the intended and unintended consequences of the decisions are going to affect next year's budget request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8513.807s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Because what I hate seeing in budgeting is when<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8517.249s">[Reinfeld]</a>: a position goes away, and I will say I'm particularly concerned about some of the middle school positions, but when it goes away and then we never go back to say, how did that pan out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8529.718s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Things just disappear and fall off the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8532.42s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I would like to see a report to inform the next budget cycle of how those impacts affected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8559.849s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8561.031s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I had phrased it, the report describing the implementation and impact of position reductions between the previous and current year budgets to understand the unintended and the intended, sorry, the intended and unintended consequences of these decisions will affect the budget request for the upcoming fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8580.035s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm happy to send that to someone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8658.347s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That's all I have to say for now, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9500.388s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Quick clarification, are the kindergarten teacher numbers based on projected enrollment or current actual enrollment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9545.288s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, because I was curious and I will say, I'm more familiar with the Roberts just because that is where I have a student because the projected enrollment is the same as the current enrollment, but the number of teachers in the budget is less than the current number of teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9561.958s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So that is an increase in class size that we're expecting, we're not sure if we're gonna need<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9620.039s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Does the housing market play a role in that in terms of, you know, I know there are neighborhoods where we're seeing a lot of younger families move in unrelated to birth rates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9643.997s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Right, okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9891.995s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That's contractual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9895.777s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It's in the teacher's contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9897.238s">[Reinfeld]</a>: All the stipend rates are there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10067.054s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10948.726s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10978.942s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11362.389s">[Reinfeld]</a>: OK, in phase 2.2c, the capital projects not eligible for community preservation or net school spending, those just get incorporated into the plan itself and don't need any kind of special call out for funding requests, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11438.741s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And so then following on that, it's presumably out of the scope of this policy to request from the city that they respond to the phase five here, the approved, go forward it to the city of Medford with the funding request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11453.991s">[Reinfeld]</a>: we're going to assume, hello, we're going to assume that we get that information back, but that's outside the scope of the policy, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11480.711s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I just wanted to make sure this is this communication is coming both ways and we're seeing in a timely manner I think the way that city council and school committee can work together on this and of course the mayor's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11493.464s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then I was curious how this interfaces with our consent agenda where we are approving purchases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11501.108s">[Reinfeld]</a>: If it's in the capital plan and in the budget, we still need to approve the actual spending of the money when appropriated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11508.611s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11509.872s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then my very last thing, I also did not find any typos, but I think that phase seven, number one, I think the two sentences should each be their own item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11523.461s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Phase 7, 1, net school spending, and then the attachment should be a separate motion to amend it in that way, if I have to make a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11561.351s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm happy to motion to waive the second reading this feels, but I was, you know what, I was on this, I was on the committee in the room when this was made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11568.216s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So let me turn it over to colleagues who are not on the strategic planning, capital planning subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LWQCkV2s9zM&t=503.182s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Rheinfeld?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LWQCkV2s9zM&t=505.323s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I have a quick question and then I'm happy to make a motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LWQCkV2s9zM&t=509.686s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm curious what collaborative budgeting looks like to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LWQCkV2s9zM&t=512.788s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Like how do you work with other people on the leadership team and in the administration and schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LWQCkV2s9zM&t=521.514s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Like how does that play out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LWQCkV2s9zM&t=693.134s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=128.409s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to sever June 24th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=153.433s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'd like to amend the approval of the teacher budget line item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=157.434s">[Reinfeld]</a>: The vote was 5-0-2, not 5-1-1.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=161.116s">[Reinfeld]</a>: There were two abstentions, no no votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1676.263s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1677.404s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is there a limitation on the number of schools from a district who can apply for this kind of thing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1693.899s">[Reinfeld]</a>: because I love this and you know I have a kid at the Roberts, so I'm super excited, but I also want to be thinking about our other elementary schools and equity across the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1903.465s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2874.85s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So there were 90 enrolled, 30 got to do Summer Fun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2877.891s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Were there people who wanted to do Summer Fun that didn't get to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3213.001s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So the students who didn't pass, what support is available?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3217.003s">[Reinfeld]</a>: What happens next for them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3879.437s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Remind me from June, this was to cover the program for one year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3883.06s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Remind me of the scope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3903.401s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So remember Russo touched on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3904.843s">[Reinfeld]</a>: What was the percentage of students who accepted?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3908.285s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We talked a lot in June about strategies for outreach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3961.961s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, do we have an opportunity to compare the students who participated with the students who didn't, whether that's through early DIBELS, early MAP, or even qualitative?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4011.953s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Because it would just be interesting to see if there was any kind of significant shift in scores comparing, looking across the cohort that was invited, those who participated and those who didn't, assuming they were on similar tiers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4025.247s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4025.607s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then my last question is, it seems like there was a lot of great teacher feedback about the format and how this works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4031.753s">[Reinfeld]</a>: How can we use the lessons that were learned in this summer experience to apply them or scale them up as we're looking at more intensive literacy training with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4044.95s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Hill and others?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5672.463s">[Reinfeld]</a>: May I ask what that looks like?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5675.684s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is that initiated by school committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5677.404s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is that initiated by the district?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5725.509s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And the population is changing a lot in Fulton Heights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6045.567s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I would love to see that committee of the whole meeting happen this fall once those numbers are presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6507.321s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Well, I would like to motion that the capital planning subcommittee in an upcoming meeting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6513.996s">[Reinfeld]</a>: dedicate an agenda item to identifying a scope and timeline for coordinated electrification across the district, because we can't keep doing this on a one-off as things fail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6524.958s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, this one's too expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6526.898s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And they all end up being too expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6528.819s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We have to do this look big picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6531.219s">[Reinfeld]</a>: This was the last one to fail, but what's next?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6537.24s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6539.621s">[Reinfeld]</a>: The capital planning subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6541.001s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6547.844s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Do you need more language?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6549.524s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I got enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6550.365s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6929.215s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm just curious why this wouldn't go towards other transportation related costs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6934.856s">[Reinfeld]</a>: If it is a parking fee for vehicles and a. Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7238.561s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reichelt?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7239.321s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm just curious whether we get any remuneration from these companies that delayed our process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7245.783s">[Reinfeld]</a>: You said they accepted full responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7249.024s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is that just an I'm sorry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7304.163s">[Reinfeld]</a>: No, it sounds like the project is going as smoothly as it can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7307.185s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I just want to thank the McGlynn Elementary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7308.846s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I know, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7310.347s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank the McGlynn Elementary community for their patience on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9454.002s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reindell?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9454.422s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Quick question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9455.263s">[Reinfeld]</a>: The priority on local produce, I absolutely see it reflected in the lunches.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9460.49s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Can we also expect to see it reflected in the breakfasts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9463.936s">[Reinfeld]</a>: which I think tend to be a little more carbon packaged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9664.853s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I love the efficiency of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9666.273s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I just want to make sure we're being aware of the effect that certain LED lights can have on headaches, migraines for the student health reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9677.808s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9678.068s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So just something to keep in mind proactively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9681.175s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10151.63s">[Reinfeld]</a>: there any other motions associated with this policy motion to waive this is this the sort of thing where we can waive the second reading because this is very much aligned with the massachusetts association of school committee recommendations so motion to waive the second reading i don't think we should do that no all right withdraw the motion okay so this will be on the agenda again next week for a final reading got it<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10247.004s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I had a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10248.084s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10248.525s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So my only question is if this is something that we need to hear from the department that's requesting the field trip or we need to acknowledge the grant by some terms of the grant, we would then just sever it from the consent agenda to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10260.809s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10261.369s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9683.445s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I sort of hate to ask this, and this is not to curtail artistic integrity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9689.886s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Either do we have community standards for what gets painted, or is there a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9697.117s">[Reinfeld]</a>: protocol in place if somehow something that shouldn't be in the lot shows up in the lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9707.383s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I trust our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9708.764s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think they're great, but I just want to have that backup.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9735.177s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I'm not a fan of censorship.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9737.278s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I just wanted, things can happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10150.718s">[Reinfeld]</a>: All those opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10153.759s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I have a question about the $75 to park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10156.16s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is that just during school hours?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10157.88s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Because I have seen in districts where you're not parking during the day, but if you are doing some sort of activity that has you there late at night, sports things, theater things run in, sometimes the car comes in after when bus service isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10206.578s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I just want to say that I...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10209.372s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, I think we shouldn't be charging people to get to school, but we charge for people to take the bus, and I don't think that parking should be free when we're charging families to pay for their own T-passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10223.575s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think there's inequity and environmental impact to that decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10790.737s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10791.777s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10792.198s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So my goal here is to give this body the opportunity to articulate how these ballot questions map to the needs of our school community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10800.803s">[Reinfeld]</a>: These are the three questions that I believe most directly affect the student and educator experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10806.927s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I do intend to divide this motion so that each component can be voted on separately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10812.29s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm happy to do that now or give an overview of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10818.455s">[Reinfeld]</a>: of what I've laid out here, described the ballot question, mapped it to the needs, and articulated a position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10826.16s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm happy to note rate question two is about eliminating the MCAS test, not as a required assessment, but as a graduation requirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10834.806s">[Reinfeld]</a>: This is something that Medford educators and parents have been asking for for many years, and it allows our educators to better focus on diverse learning styles, needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10845.173s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It expands the definition of success.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10847.202s">[Reinfeld]</a>: reduces anxiety, and increases equity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10850.645s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Question seven is a direct response to the budget crisis that we saw last spring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10855.029s">[Reinfeld]</a>: To replace those one-time funds, we all, I assume, remember how devastating the $2.7 million worth of cuts, plus the 2.2 million that we didn't even identify what those would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10867.821s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So that's valid question seven, along with the...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10872.385s">[Reinfeld]</a>: The Department of Public Works, we've spent a lot of time talking about transportation and how there are not necessarily viable alternatives for our families and students within certain distances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10882.911s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Some of that is on busing, which is also addressed by the ballot initiatives, but also on street and sidewalk repair, which makes safer environments for everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10893.097s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then question eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10894.935s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think really addresses the challenges, these underlying challenges that we have seen come up, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10901.258s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We heard enrollment in the arts is low and it's not because students don't want to be taking arts, it's because they don't have room in their schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10908.861s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Many people enrolled in vocational programs aren't able to take the AP courses that will assist in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10915.243s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And so I just found out that my fourth grader in taking<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10921.471s">[Reinfeld]</a>: starting an instrument is probably going to be missing art class or science class every week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10928.253s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And that's a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10931.794s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And so we need to expand what we offer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10934.435s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We probably need to expand the teacher workday, the student learning opportunities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10940.217s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We are at the state minimum for how much time students, instructional time students have in class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10946.218s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But if we're gonna ask people to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10949.496s">[Reinfeld]</a>: to spend more time in the classroom, we have to pay them for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10952.197s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We found out how low many of our stipends are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10956.379s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We have been hearing for years about competition with other districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10961.14s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And so that is question eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10965.042s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then the final section of this motion is an acknowledgement that this doesn't solve all the problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10969.803s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We are still committed as a body to working to make sure<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10974.798s">[Reinfeld]</a>: our students and educators have what they need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10977.761s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I welcome edits or additions from my colleagues, and I really appreciate the opportunity to articulate how these three valid questions impact our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11005.473s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So what's our definition?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11013.619s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, it says this test is not the key thing that says yes or no, you graduate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11420.451s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think we, sorry, I think, Simon, are you here for this question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11425.613s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm so sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11426.514s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We have our frequent flyer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11430.576s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Would you like to speak?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11489.402s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I have some, I have a couple of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11491.263s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeldt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11492.124s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm curious what happened to the language about student use and signage from the original policy or what's online?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11519.244s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11519.704s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So on that one, I would want to add nicotine pouches and gum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11524.445s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I'm not sure if that belongs in the staff one as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11527.886s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But that's a non-tobacco product, but it is, this is things like Zin and yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11539.569s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So it's not tobacco, but it is nicotine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11542.209s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11552.743s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Nicotine pouches.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11555.764s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I actually wasn't sure about gum because I know some people need that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11559.366s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I don't know what our school policy is on gum actually, but I know that's helping to combat addiction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11572.431s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think we should.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11573.571s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Not patches, pouches, the pop in your mouth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11581.63s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, I have our assistant super chair saying yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9508.884s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Can we see a copy of what the baseline numbers look like?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9514.869s">[Reinfeld]</a>: What is elevated?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9515.909s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is zero the baseline on everything?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10349.916s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I have three questions, two of them for Director Perry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10353.86s">[Reinfeld]</a>: You said HECAT framework changes to curriculum end of year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10357.043s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is that end of calendar year or end of school year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10365.401s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10366.081s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then I was wondering at the middle school level, how the reduction in guidance counselors has affected the delivery of health education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10373.662s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I know that was a big question during budget season about the teaching responsibilities with that position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10398.553s">[Reinfeld]</a>: have other, do they have room in their schedule for other activities?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10402.294s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That was one of the things that concerns were expressed about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10418.52s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10419.06s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then my third question was just to confirm that the caregiver university is an a la carte model.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10424.462s">[Reinfeld]</a>: People can tune in and out to different sessions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10426.863s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It's not an enrollment based.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10429.292s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13062.046s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13062.846s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, I was just wondering what opportunities there are for teachers to give feedback or share<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13069.892s">[Reinfeld]</a>: how well it is working for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13071.413s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I realize there's still a lot of training going on, but that formative assessment of, is this curriculum working for us and for the people who are delivering it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13079.577s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I can see a lot of these meetings coming, we're looking at the student data and we're really focused on the students, which is absolutely important, but I, where the teacher voice and their experience, is that happening in the PD sessions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13096.305s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is that happening in the weekly meetings?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13196.451s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And participation on the DLT is volunteer basis?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13200.635s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13201.455s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And we don't turn anybody away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13205.358s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But there's no stipend?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13487.255s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I would like to amend this the same way I amended last week's to include nicotine pouches and non, we have the phrasing in last week's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13496.929s">[Reinfeld]</a>: minutes to include nicotine pouches and state exclusion of prescription nicotine products, such as patches prescribed to end nicotine dependence and addiction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1659.227s">[Reinfeld]</a>: My question is what of these<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1663.68s">[Reinfeld]</a>: can or should be bundled right does it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1666.322s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Do we need to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1668.224s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Does it help to do all the HVAC together because of a vendor or because of timing, or is everything here, like the roof rebuilds does it not matter which building it's on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2033.922s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, that reminds me of one of the resolutions we just had, I think last month or maybe it was the beginning of this month, around understanding what the needs to upgrade electrical systems to move away from fossil fuels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2049.485s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I realize that's not a specific project, but that's something we want to be planning for so that we're not kind of forced into making these decisions around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2062.308s">[Reinfeld]</a>: just on the basis of cost and availability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2067.309s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So that's an assessment that we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2152.518s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Though presumably that's the kind of thing, I guess then that question comes to the same question we had before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2159.284s">[Reinfeld]</a>: If we wait on that, does the price go up or down?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2161.506s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Because some capital projects, the price goes up if you don't do it right away, and sometimes it goes down significantly if you give it a year for the technology to catch up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2171.434s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So which direction does this lean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2176.378s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Do we know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2284.744s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So that, and so the cost of doing that is people's time, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2289.112s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Or is it time and training?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2292.385s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is it hiring of people?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2352.731s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, then my other question in terms of making this list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2357.796s">[Reinfeld]</a>: These are all the things that we know are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2362.6s">[Reinfeld]</a>: going to be big problems soon-ish.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2367.522s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is there a kind of middle tier list of things that we know are coming in the medium term, but if we don't proactively maintain them, they're going to get worse and become even exponentially more expensive to fix?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2382.409s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I'm thinking about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2385.615s">[Reinfeld]</a>: The analogy here is things like our roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2387.596s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It's a lot harder to repair roads that are severely weather damaged and potholes and all of this than to do maintenance on things that are showing wear and tear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2400.084s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And that saves us from doing desperate repairs later on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2406.108s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I know we didn't, I didn't ask you to prepare this in advance of this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2409.811s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So maybe this is a better question for November, but I want to think about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2416.963s">[Reinfeld]</a>: what we need to fix now to stop it from becoming a huge cost?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2643.626s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2644.426s">[Reinfeld]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2645.067s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2645.888s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I wanted to put those things out there as they have to be factored in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2650.952s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think we're probably at a point where we need to now start that prioritization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2821.024s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I mean, ADA compliance to me feels like we really need to get in compliance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2830.551s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But tell me more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2832.593s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I know we're waiting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2834.014s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I know we had identified some things at the high school, and I think we're waiting for member Branley to call the building and grounds meeting on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2843.441s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Does this go with that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2956.877s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I will recognize that I jumped on member Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2959.217s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think he was also going to say something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2961.898s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We should see that we should finish this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3024.364s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I just moved that up with the like recommissioning assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3027.765s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I was going to say that category is recommissioning for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3053.311s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Sorry, one other thing on that one, on electrification, is that, is there any sort of grant to support that assessment for climate mitigation, for energy, alternative energies?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3073.98s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3077.145s">[Reinfeld]</a>: but that seems like something that should be supported.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3160.415s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Well, and on the drainage, is there any, I know that's something that you were really thinking about with the new McGlynn playground because, I mean, that playground was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3173.14s">[Reinfeld]</a>: regularly not draining to understatement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3186.009s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So it's not a drainage issue, but there is a drainage issue there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3192.374s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I was just wondering if there's a service contract to be maintaining<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3198.072s">[Reinfeld]</a>: this turf setting, does it also, is it possible to bundle that with the other school, even though they're, however- I believe the turf is being, I believe we are finally on the maintenance contract at the Brooks, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3214.777s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3217.418s">[Reinfeld]</a>: With the door sweeps, there was also a dumpster mitigation that I wrote down that I don't see in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3226.368s">[Reinfeld]</a>: the general, there were two pest control issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3285.232s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And that's all one project?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3286.592s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That should all be in line 27 or are they separate lines?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3592.113s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, part of my question on that is, what does that do to summer programs that we're offering in different schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3600.481s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I know most of our programming this summer was at Missittuck and high school, unless I'm missing something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3610.811s">[Reinfeld]</a>: In the Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3612.232s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3761.242s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, as I recall, there's the determination based on what the project is, and then there's also a funding threshold, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3767.707s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Because I'm looking, if I'm remembering correctly, and I might not be, it was 250,000 was a cutoff, and I'm looking right there at network closet mini split.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3784.019s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I don't know what borderline is gonna dictate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3787.754s">[Reinfeld]</a>: how things are classified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3788.935s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So if that's if we need to look at that quote a little more carefully for that determination, we might need to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3798.302s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I'm sure knows that number much better than I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3835.523s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I mean, the only thing that comes to mind is we have talked about getting elementary school students into middle school spaces, whether it's after school or some other reorganization down the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3851.949s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I don't know that that is concrete enough, but I know that when I spoke to Nick Tucci, for example, the concerns around having elementary school students in there would require some changes to classrooms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3872.338s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I don't know what the timeframe is that maybe the superintendent knows that a little bit better or somebody who's been talking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3878.061s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I know we're due to get an update on after school at the Andrews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3882.243s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But that is something that is potentially a capital project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3892.249s">[Reinfeld]</a>: If we're looking at changing who is in the middle school building, the what are currently the middle school buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3918.303s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, quite capital, but right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3921.164s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That's a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3944.21s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I guess, Dr. Cushing, you mentioned the roof as being ready for solar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3950.251s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Are there other solar projects that are possibilities down the line?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3957.361s">[Reinfeld]</a>: you mentioned that for the Andrews, are we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4059.608s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4060.889s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4061.209s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I was talking to a third grader who apparently they like to be fed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4066.372s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4067.032s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It's weird.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4068.253s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4072.446s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, fourth grade, whoops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4073.807s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Anyway, I was gonna say, I think this is when I was having audio trouble, but anything Curtis Tufts, I assume that those calculations are being made with MSBA thinking in mind of what's worth doing in a building if we really are looking to co-locate and that five to seven, sorry, five year plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4098.926s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4227.081s">[Reinfeld]</a>: No, we have that date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4228.402s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4267.302s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So does that take the place of adjournment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4269.422s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That is correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4270.043s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2140.529s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, so this presentation was very much about remediation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2143.852s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I am wondering, while we have these folks on the line, if there's anything we need to be keeping in mind for a new building that could potentially be coming to Medford in the next few years, we hope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2224.608s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Absolutely, of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2225.709s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Are there resources available to help with some of that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2229.25s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It's not remediation if it hasn't happened yet, but you mentioned grants for getting filling stations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2237.153s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is that sort of thing available for new installations?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4445.746s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4448.823s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I just wanted to ask if you are thinking about expanding the pool of drivers or what is the main impediment there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4456.79s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is it salary?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4458.271s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is it the timing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4459.332s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is it just a fixed thing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4460.693s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And the reason I'm asking is as we look to plan for the next few years, what are some things that we maybe could expect in order to get the pool of people we needed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4474.043s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think member Graham's questions around how we can support the people who are already there<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4479.15s">[Reinfeld]</a>: are really key, but looking at expanding the pool, like once people are in as drivers, do they stay or are we losing people partway through the year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4487.753s">[Reinfeld]</a>: What can we do to make sure we have more people?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4525.106s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4525.366s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And would we be looking at that going up in the future?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4527.587s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It's going to go up every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4651.843s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Like if we shifted school days, that's not going to make a difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4657.13s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I mean, I live right in Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3573.878s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I just want to comment kind of a combination of these last two questions about transparency in the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3578.479s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So member Graham already mentioned that the budget process is by law an open budgeting process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3584.041s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But I want to say we in Bethlehem Public Schools are in a really good position to be transparent about things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3589.983s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Our budget process got incredibly cleaned up by our last finance director who continues to consult one of the smoothest, most well accounted for budgeting that we've seen in quite a while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3601.866s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I was not school committee, but I watched the meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3604.487s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It is a clean budget book.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3605.767s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We know where the money's going, how it's being spent, and we're going to continue to have those public meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3610.148s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We have a new capital planning process policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3613.328s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We have open subcommittee meetings where these things are happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3616.469s">[Reinfeld]</a>: They're happening in public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3617.509s">[Reinfeld]</a>: These conversations, we are collecting input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3619.989s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So we are in a really good position to show what is happening in the schools, where the money is going, and how it is responding to the needs that we're hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3631.613s">[Reinfeld]</a>: from our department heads, from administration, from our vendors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3636.899s">[Reinfeld]</a>: This is a good time to be transparent and we're ready to do that with these questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4723.358s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I did look at these numbers when I was doing some of the analysis and our levels are back to where they were right before the pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4732.16s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So when people left the school to have their needs met elsewhere, they're coming back to Medford and they're coming back with significant need based on not just the pandemic, but just general student needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4748.724s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And so I think things are going up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4919.626s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I was just going to say, we got here because we made decisions that filled short-term needs, that were band-aids, and we didn't look.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4932.481s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Far ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5004.756s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We're making decisions based on the money that's available and what we can and can't do, not necessarily what is best for students in the long term from the school side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=157.043s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Sure, it is really hard to just to know we have another member online now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=513.706s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Before we go, yes, can I ask, so this seemed to be, when I went through it, very much aligned with the notes that came out of Department of Education and this fact sheet, the final rule fact sheet that has kind of the key components.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=528.17s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I'm wondering how much of this is the language that was already recommended versus specific to Medford, because I think I am confident that in having a policy that complies with federal law,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=544.505s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We shouldn't be debating a lot of those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=642.145s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Great, so I think going through it piece by piece and maybe having member Russo and Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=647.409s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Bowen provide a little bit of the guidance of this is what this is doing here or how it plays out would be helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=713.712s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I know it was what we what we were just looking at was the preamble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=717.034s">[Reinfeld]</a>: There's one piece that says sex discrimination that right there where your mouse was prohibits sex discrimination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=722.839s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Should that be sexual discrimination?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=727.222s">[Reinfeld]</a>: You know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=729.457s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Everything else is really consistent and then I didn't know if that was just left in as sex discrimination, but I promise I'm not, this was the only place I got that detail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=753.265s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm not inclined to go in and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=775.26s">[Reinfeld]</a>: My sense was that sexual discrimination was the term that was being used to cover all of these things laid out here, plus sexual harassment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1056.98s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is there a definition of the word consider?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1059.201s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Because it's not offer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1062.163s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It's not, like, I suspect that is one of those words that is legally, it means one thing in legal terms and the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1086.328s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Nope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1087.308s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Versus offering those supportive measures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1089.909s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Like, I feel like that's implied here, but it isn't explicit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1109.554s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It's provided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1119.969s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That says if you're not providing supportive measures, you have to say why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1123.932s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Like we went straight to disciplinary action for these reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1128.835s">[Reinfeld]</a>: There was an imminent danger.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1131.357s">[Reinfeld]</a>: This was not a safe environment in which to offer this supportive measure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1139.322s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1146.583s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It's the non-punitive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1410.039s">[Reinfeld]</a>: This may not qualify for this type of measure, but it could still be a violation of other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1546.694s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And we don't have any definitions of what a reasonable timeframe is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1574.65s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But there's separate language for acknowledgement of the receipt of the complaint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1645.558s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Remember, Randall wants to say something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1650.201s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1651.422s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So this is the section where I had a lot of questions, and I think it comes up in the bullying policy as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1657.125s">[Reinfeld]</a>: If there are more than two parties, if we're talking about a group,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1661.854s">[Reinfeld]</a>: like a team of people or multiple staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1667.558s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think there's a lot of confusion on what gets investigated on a person by person basis versus people as a group talking amongst themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1679.667s">[Reinfeld]</a>: If you have a group of students who is either filing a complaint or is being<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1688.928s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Or is the respondent or respondents, whether they're getting individual, whether all of these words, multiple things happening simultaneously versus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1699.039s">[Reinfeld]</a>: An investigation into a group situation, and that's not really addressed, and I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1707.488s">[Reinfeld]</a>: if there's guidance there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1709.91s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Obviously, I can try to talk to lawyers about that, but I don't know how that works in some of our other policies, because I know there has been a lot of concerns where I was told one thing and I was told another, and then parents start sharing with each other around the same situation, and there's just lots of conflicting information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1743.269s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1743.809s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I have examples that aren't Title IX specific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1749.31s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1750.77s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1751.711s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1752.411s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So for example, a group of middle schoolers is caught with vaping supplies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1763.271s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And each student is being, the investigation is happening individually with those students, but the outcomes of those end up being different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1776.078s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And so the parents, you know, suspension might happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1779.721s">[Reinfeld]</a>: One student is suspended, another one isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1783.291s">[Reinfeld]</a>: parents are comparing notes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1786.032s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And they're saying, this is what the administration told me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1788.632s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, well, this is what they told me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1790.313s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I can't release information about this other student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1794.574s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But the parent has given me this information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1796.554s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I want to bring that as part of my complaint, because my kids were together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1801.075s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Our kids were together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1802.776s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is that helpful?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1833.629s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Do that or want to know, like, what else is there's a video, the reviewing of evidence, like, there's a there's a video of something that happens and.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1842.035s">[Reinfeld]</a>: 1 complaint complainant can't review a video because it contains footage of another complainant, for example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1928.382s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Right, if there is collective bullying for a group of LGBTQ students or the school say, I don't think this is going to happen, but school is not providing adequate pumping space for new parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1962.088s">[Reinfeld]</a>: and we as a group want to file a complaint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1966.071s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Can we as a group file a complaint or does it have to be a series of individual complaints?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2124.653s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, the sports scenarios are coming to mind, and I'm trying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2129.475s">[Reinfeld]</a>: To note that, I mean, we are in a public meeting and so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2138.63s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, we were on page nine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2157.985s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, and I see, yeah, for any purpose not directly related to this grievance procedure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2164.795s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So if there is a interconnected investigation that remains within the single grievance or, okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2511.138s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And this might've been the previous section, but so there's this timeline talks about the elimination of conditions once the determination has been made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2524.02s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It doesn't, this policy doesn't seem to say a lot about while the investigation is going on, making sure things are safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2537.574s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, in advance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2539.522s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2541.148s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2589.619s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Does that supportive measure potentially include<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2595.325s">[Reinfeld]</a>: removal of the respondent or the alleged perpetrator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2629.909s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Because one of the real challenges of these situations is that a lot of the burden to remain safe is on the victim or alleged victim or complainant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2644.043s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And that can be really hard and further exacerbating of a situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2683.257s">[Reinfeld]</a>: but like administrative leave can't happen during it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2686.859s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And when does administrative leave?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2715.049s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Privacy challenges on both sides are significant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2718.23s">[Reinfeld]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2718.51s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2872.932s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I mean, an anonymous report is not a formal complaint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2878.936s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I think that's certainly where we've seen in higher education these things come out, is people saying, well, I can't do anything until a formal complaint is filed, and people don't feel safe submitting a formal complaint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2893.151s">[Reinfeld]</a>: whatever it is, but it's this horrible catch 22, maybe not even a catch 22, but a paradox of people just, people need to be good people, but.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2965.352s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, because I did have a question is we have one appeal officer and what happens if<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2972.378s">[Reinfeld]</a>: This is purely hypothetical, not based on the individual named, but what happens if the appeals officer is involved in this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2980.132s">[Reinfeld]</a>: There needs to be an alternative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3013.066s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I don't know, since you said part of this is about communicating what the avenues are, that was my question here is do we need to communicate that in the event of the designated person not being able to be that unbiased decision maker, these are the alternate paths.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3034.557s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It was only because that particular role had one person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3112.313s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That is how I take them as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3113.914s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I just was wondering about how explicit we need to be about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3118.737s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And just since we're in public, I like John Bruno very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3122.86s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Me too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3126.663s">[Reinfeld]</a>: At my child's school, just not picking on him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3416.789s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I have been trying to figure out a way to rephrase the phrase victim without their consent because it implies that a victim can give consent up in the definition section, but I haven't settled on anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3533.337s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Interpreter, but until it's been proven, they can't put that in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3544.406s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So they do say that alleged victim is a. Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3551.933s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That person, but that's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3616.496s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So does this automatically go to a regular meeting or do we waive?<br><br>
