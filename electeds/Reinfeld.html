    <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1834.71s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I was potentially going to motion to take 2025-03 out of order, because that either seems to be a sending this to the subcommittee or just updating the policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1846.918s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I see this is coming up on the agenda, but maybe Member Ruseau could clarify whether this is a policy update or a recommendation to send it to the subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3402.575s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I agree with that and the reason behind it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3405.115s">[Reinfeld]</a>: My only question is whether that poses a, if we're looking to be opening registration in January, are we concerned that that would affect people's ability to commit or our ability to guarantee a spot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3478.234s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Will this opening of registration coincide with other summer programs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3482.616s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I don't know if jumpstart dates are set or other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5752.275s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I was also going to ask about financial aid or sliding scale.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5755.258s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I support that as seeing that model.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5759.041s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I would actually like to see more of a differential between the resident and Medford school staff rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5770.47s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And non-residents, the rec center program is 250, Power Kids is 315, and then I believe Six Acres is 850 for two weeks, which turns into 425 for one week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5783.033s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And so looking at our numbers here, I think particularly for non-residents, we can definitely push that up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5794.311s">[Reinfeld]</a>: when we want to be prioritizing the people in Medford and Medford schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5836.38s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I also just wanted to add, I think the CIT program is a fantastic addition, and I love that for our older students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5843.361s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I support having things be a little higher so that we can pay our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5848.542s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So finding that balance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5849.923s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But I do think we can have a bigger delta between in Medford and out of Medford residents, although it sounds like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5857.524s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Was that 10 students per week, or was that over the course of the whole summer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=7372.825s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld and then Member Intapa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=7375.725s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yep, I have another amendment to add.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=7377.846s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I would like to add in between the access to school premises and dismissal of students language about bus encounters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=7387.729s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So if the encounter involves school sponsored transportation, bus drivers and monitors shall take the following steps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=7394.13s">[Reinfeld]</a>: One, do not discharge students until instructed to do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=7397.171s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Two, do not allow the agents onto the bus until instructed to do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=7402.173s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Three, request identification from the agents and a copy of any judicial warrant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=7406.435s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Four, immediately contact the superintendent's office for further instructions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=7410.396s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And five, contact the transportation office to document the incident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=7414.197s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Again, this is the practice that is happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=7417.038s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It mirrors the language of entry into school premises, but our student-provided transportation is an area that we also need to include in this, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=7438.126s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Do you want this language to go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=7442.369s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=7444.271s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=7695.773s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=7698.55s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I will also say there is some significance to today being Holocaust Remembrance Day, and I would actually love to have this passed on this day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=5040.401s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you for this overview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=5041.641s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think I was the one who initially wanted this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=5044.722s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And one thing that I don't see a lot of here and I imagine will be coming up in presumably that some of it is going to be addressed in the supplemental proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=5054.365s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But part of the reason for this report was to inform the fiscal year 26<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=5059.887s">[Reinfeld]</a>: budgets, particularly around the impact on students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=5063.468s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I know at the elementary level, it ended up tweaking some of the class sizes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=5069.13s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Middle schools, I'm still concerned about the loss of the guidance Councilors and bringing that back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=5074.552s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think I have a middle schooler I've seen<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=5079.235s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It's working, but I think we've lost some of the aspects of student support because these guidance Councilors are spending their whole time teaching, and it's affecting also other classes in teaching.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=5093.061s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And so I'm hoping to see a little more information about the impact on the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=5099.844s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Graham mentioned what was happening with the administrative assistance and the, you know, these stipends were, I talked to a few of the people who received the stipends to cover some of the responsibilities from the Director of Professional Learning and Assessment, and that seems to be working reasonably well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=5120.289s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm curious where you see<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=5122.59s">[Reinfeld]</a>: needing to invest in fiscal year 26 for some of the less budgetary impacts, but the student experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=5241.042s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=5241.542s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That's useful to hear kind of what are the urgent needs that are being addressed by this immediate infusion of override funds, but to note that this is still a conversation that we're having about the next budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=5266.488s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=6635.815s">[Reinfeld]</a>: clarifying question on the restoring of the administrative system at McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=6640.484s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Will that end up being two administrative assistants for two schools or will it be one per school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=6645.393s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is it designated?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=6652.283s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I know people fill in for their person next to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=6669.963s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=6670.843s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Branley covered my other clarifying question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=6673.464s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then one last one, you mentioned that the administrative floater had been supporting food services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=6678.145s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We're not leaving food services in the lurch by transferring that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=6681.946s">[Reinfeld]</a>: No, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=6706.285s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=6706.625s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I just wanted to make sure we were in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=7416.826s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I was just hoping you could speak a little more about the logistics of how funds reserved for bargaining for a future contract gets spent in the bargaining fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=7429.575s">[Reinfeld]</a>: You alluded to it for a couple of these items, but just explaining how that works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=237.753s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7199.662s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, minor quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7201.745s">[Reinfeld]</a>: When will the McGlynn schematic get to 100%?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7203.947s">[Reinfeld]</a>: How does that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7291.566s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I just want to make sure this isn't going to introduce some new delays unexpectedly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7296.128s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7296.388s">[Reinfeld]</a>: This is how this timeline is built is to do it this way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7299.428s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then I'm wondering if you can comment on the in-classroom experience in the hot months of May and June and what are we looking at?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7308.61s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We don't have a great solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7309.971s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7326.482s">[Reinfeld]</a>: May and June have not been... Well, we usually have like two to five really brutal days and that's when everyone gets hot and angry, hot and bothered, should we say?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7392.648s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I just, I wanna be ready and anticipating what things are gonna be like and being able to tell people, this is why it is this way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7953.618s">[Reinfeld]</a>: To be clear, I am in favor of approving it, but I think it's useful to have the context of what was discussed in the capital planning meetings because we were supposed to have had that last week and have that context for the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7968.283s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But I'm on that subcommittee, so I know what's coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7972.124s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I guess maybe I'd defer to the people who<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=7976.87s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, I am in favor of doing it tonight, but I think it's useful to have the context of that plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=8048.255s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Director McCue is ready, so I withdraw the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9583.026s">[Reinfeld]</a>: How does that coincide with the lifetime?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9589.571s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And it was a reasonable proportion of the freight motor lifetime.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9594.295s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It wasn't like, oh, we're getting 1% of its valuable lifetime by doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5kvVHmOpvvU&t=9598.278s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It did line up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=194.707s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I just wanted to relay from a comment that I received from the public of looking for somebody who's going to prioritize some of whom maybe are more vulnerable populations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=205.912s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I know that is something that Dr. Edouard-Vincent was very committed to as well, but to really make that explicit, that we are potentially looking at a fair bit of turmoil as changing federal and state regulations come down, filter down to local districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=222.999s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And so,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=224.199s">[Reinfeld]</a>: being on top of that and aware of how it affects the wide range of populations within our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=496.513s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Galusi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=580.122s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=602.709s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=213.835s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6629.004s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That's how I read the motion here is to create a job description.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6634.702s">[Reinfeld]</a>: for somebody who will work in collaboration with the city and propose the stipend for Director Nwaje to continue the work through the fiscal year in a consulting stipend basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6646.117s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So that is how I'm reading this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10446.908s">[Reinfeld]</a>: You mentioned renovation couldn't get something up to ADA standards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10451.031s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Can you confirm that we do have ADA accessible bathrooms?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10454.653s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10485.379s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So not necessarily convenient for people who need them, but they are on site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=10491.574s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12140.012s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I would like to know either at the second reading or as a result of the investigation, just who<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12146.238s">[Reinfeld]</a>: where the responsibility is going to lie for doing that testing because this most recent round of testing obviously was through the program that we are now no longer eligible for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12155.002s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I mean, we're eligible for the grants to update the drinking stations, but we can't, we won't be having the state come in and do this testing to the level that we did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12164.347s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I don't need it codified, but I would like it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12166.588s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I would like to know who's going, where that responsibility will lie, but I will second the motion to approve the first reading on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=615.207s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yep, just to refresh, the funding source for that, some of it is allocated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=621.829s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Where's that coming from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=623.589s">[Reinfeld]</a>: How much of that is already allocated and how much of it needs to be directed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=628.071s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I know we didn't have the final number until recently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=667.286s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=667.626s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=667.826s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Cause I know we had designated some things for HVAC, but it's all bonded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=671.487s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=729.426s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Does that make sense so far?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=731.326s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, I'll just put in a request to keep it bundled when we present to the full committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=736.588s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We don't need to go back and forth on every element of it with that funding source.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=755.633s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=755.914s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I just think the rest of the committee is going to want to know that and see that in front of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1064.5s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Sounds good to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1065.502s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I think it makes sense if it's going to up the chances of getting some funding for these other projects that we know are coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1088.53s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And are those, do you know, are those typically funded at the full cost?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1092.693s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is it a portion and then the district needs to come up with the rest or district slash city?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1159.582s">[Reinfeld]</a>: This was one of the items where I was wondering if there was any alignment with similar efforts parallel efforts in other city buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1246.1s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I would love to that timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1248.221s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That's fantastic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1249.242s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And do you think it's possible to get a sense of the timeline before our committee of the whole term special meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1270.315s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1493.838s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1494.258s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1675.891s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And that was one of the ones we flagged saying, should this be concurrent with HVAC?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1681.074s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Did we get an answer on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1683.875s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It's not sounding like it's tied to that or there's any real connection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1761.33s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And former member McLaughlin had mentioned<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1766.374s">[Reinfeld]</a>: a grant that I know was a challenge logistically to apply for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1771.278s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then when we did get an application in, we were not funded for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1776.022s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I don't know if that's something that we can revisit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1778.284s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think Dr. Cushing might have been the person involved with that, but also Director Nwaje.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1783.889s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Dr. Cushing, are you there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1794.19s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I was asking about the grant that member McLaughlin mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1798.911s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I know we couldn't get the application in one year, and another year we got it in, but it didn't come through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1875.881s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And who's we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1915.48s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Then let me ask a clarifying question about these items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1920.544s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Are we out of compliance or are we in danger of being out of compliance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1953.583s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And are the fixes that are costed out here, I know the range is big,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1959.998s">[Reinfeld]</a>: will those have sufficient longevity that we won't need to be looking at this again in the immediate future?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=1966.789s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It's a real fix.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=2166.316s">[Reinfeld]</a>: The Disability Commission?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=2358.897s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think we should.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=2359.758s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I also think we can't be dependent on this grant coming through to get in compliance for accessibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=2366.103s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think this has to be a priority with or without the grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=2396.209s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then you asked what else here in the shaded portion is a priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=2400.471s">[Reinfeld]</a>: When you say the flashing failed, the word failed is always worrisome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=2404.274s">[Reinfeld]</a>: What does that mean for those of us who are not stonemasons?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=2413.179s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, and we're fixing that for the roofs on other buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=2417.081s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That also feels like a... Mend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=2636.133s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Will that come out in this mini recommissioning assessment that we've just split off?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3448.02s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, yeah, I think so this isn't on the verge of failing or this isn't already failed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3652.167s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I was going to ask what the timeline for the assessment is, but it sounds like we don't have that number either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3758.442s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And it happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3759.402s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We were in elementary school when we started this conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3762.024s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Do we have what we need to do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3766.388s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I can't it's up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3768.63s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, it sounds like we have a quote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3775.195s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And is it going to affect?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3777.036s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I don't know how long it takes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3778.157s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3780.459s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Are people using the field now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3784.382s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, so is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3787.044s">[Reinfeld]</a>: How long does it take?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3787.904s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I remember when the Roberts playground drainage issue was happening and kids couldn't play on the playground and I won't mention that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3817.84s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, so this isn't going to disrupt essential recess activities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3824.483s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think so, right, Peter?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=3833.786s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, and then yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=4237.567s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, three at Andrews, two at McGlynn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=4398.177s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So that goes into in progress?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5214.535s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'll just jump in and say, I do spend a lot of time at the Roberts, given that, well, I only have one kid there now, but there have been residential properties that have now been converted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5228.745s">[Reinfeld]</a>: The available land, whether that was even an option to take for the schools, to purchase for the schools, is a question to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5240.083s">[Reinfeld]</a>: There aren't a lot of properties it's it's very residential it's houses and we put up the, there's a new, there are new condos and then there's an ambiguous construction going on on Park Street and Hickey Park is the closest park and that ends up being<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5257.694s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It shouldn't be a 10 minute walk, but it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5259.635s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And it's a 15 minute walk with kindergartners and have to do field trip forms to go to the park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5265.519s">[Reinfeld]</a>: They do field day there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5266.619s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It would be nice to get some kind of connection with Hickey, but it is a few blocks away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5272.343s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I do think space is at a premium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5571.877s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5573.197s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So the question on the table is, are we prioritizing any of these schools for a CPC application this year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5580.099s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5777.562s">[Reinfeld]</a>: The other hard conversation, which is not the scope of this meeting, but is how are we managing the unevenness in population in schools across the district, whether that's looking at reorganizing the grade levels, whether it's just redistricting, whether it's somebody come up to me and say, we should just open a new school, which I suppose that's on the table too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5805.2s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So that's another hard conversation that informs what type of playground we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=5809.462s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Because if we move to a different model, we may have a different student population in that building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6014.583s">[Reinfeld]</a>: One of the elementary schools in my hometown did that, but they actually had the whole school underground as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6022.911s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It was very cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6023.591s">[Reinfeld]</a>: They had it elevated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6024.953s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It was very cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6027.645s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That was the 60s and 70s that that happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6031.446s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Weird architectural world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6046.572s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I'm sorry for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6048.972s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We ended the last one early, so this was due.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6145.489s">[Reinfeld]</a>: You might want to, picky details, flip Missituk and Brooks, because it sounds like that's the priority order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6185.143s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I was just going off the conversation that happened before, but you're right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6188.184s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We didn't have that conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6190.044s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6207.285s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Have we identified all of the, right, this meeting was timed so that we could say this is, I see the potential open space CPC.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6215.649s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I don't see any of that for the current projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6219.892s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Actually, some things had been committed up at the top.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6222.353s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, and then we have an application pending for Curtis Tufts, yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6232.958s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, I see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6238.666s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I think the question is what we're asking school committee to, I guess, is this the work of the district to say what if this is going into a supplemental budget request?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6252.392s">[Reinfeld]</a>: What is coming out of funds that have already been allocated and what is a new request to city council or from capital stabilization, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6264.297s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Some of the mitigation is potentially a stabilization<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6269.841s">[Reinfeld]</a>: fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6285.674s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm also trying to do the math on what the grand total here is, but I don't know that a grand total is what's important so much as the total for each of these buckets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6390.919s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then the other element of this process was net school spending, but that's covered under the recommend proceeding in fiscal year 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6443.555s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And what does that mean for something like LED lighting replacement, which ends up being $180,000 across the three schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6489.463s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, yep, there's that column.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6491.883s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Sorry, I've zoomed in and I'm scrolling back and forth, so apologies for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6672.569s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Do we need a deadline?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6673.93s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I know a couple people took action items to confirm quotes or points of contact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6679.315s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is there, do you, in preparing that slide, do you need, is there a deadline you want that information by?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6684.939s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Obviously we want it as soon as we can get it, but reasonable demands on people's time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6696.869s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Till end of next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6706.087s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, nobody's working Thursday, Friday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6768.058s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'll do that one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6769.599s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to adjourn by Member Reinfeld, seconded by Member Ruseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6772.801s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qorztDP2QHI&t=6774.281s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=427.305s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=573.578s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think Member Olapade summarized it well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=575.519s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think it would be good for this committee to understand what has been happening, what the need is, and what that intersection looks like in terms of building capacity within the district, understanding that there is very particular training that Director Nwaje has that people in the school district don't have, and just really making the best use of people's time and expertise in a really collaborative way that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=601.716s">[Reinfeld]</a>: make sure that everyone who needs to be supported is supported on both sides of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=839.922s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think that's fantastic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=841.463s">[Reinfeld]</a>: The language in this resolution is very vague, and so I am very eager to know how we are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=849.858s">[Reinfeld]</a>: to know the details.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=851.139s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So thank you for being here, Frances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=1109.403s">[Reinfeld]</a>: No, I just, I'm curious, are you a mandated reporter?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=1590.799s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I was going to ask if you can't do hours, is there a way to estimate what percentage of the time or what I'm trying to do, because we're being asked to put this into the school budget, which I think is a very fair request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=1606.311s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And so trying to figure out, I know that we can't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=1610.947s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But a value on this but to figure out in a proportionately and looking across the system at how this how this shakes out in terms of what time the staff would be spending.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=1625.183s">[Reinfeld]</a>: scrambling around to get answers versus you having answers more at the ready and just kind of the percentage or what this looks like if you know I think we are blessed to have a resource in house like this and.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=1847.262s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Another question, you mentioned having an idea and coming to discuss that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=1854.443s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Again, in the trying to understand what all of this is a resource for and is supporting what that means, what's the balance around things that you are responding to requests from within the school community versus bringing things to the attention versus just the routine follow-up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=1910.279s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I ran into Janine when I was on campus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=1915.981s">[Reinfeld]</a>: There are these things that I cannot touch and I should not touch and we absolutely<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=1984.326s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Well, I think that that was kind of what I was getting at or wondering about at in terms of building capacity within the district because there is so much work we can do on so many of these fronts, whether it's a physical constraint a cultural constraint a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=2000.118s">[Reinfeld]</a>: situational something that arises in terms of being responsive to what's happening, but also building awareness of resources, of best practices, and all of that, both in terms of our administration, but also the staff and the employees more generally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=2020.869s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I think we have an opportunity, as we say, we have an opportunity to work with Director Nwaje on what DEI looks like in our district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=2029.592s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm wondering what that opportunity is and whether it's, you know, it is, no, it's really, this is about compliance or this is about the opportunity to do more and make our district a better, more welcoming, more compliant place, which I think is something we would all<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=2049.423s">[Reinfeld]</a>: love to do and to have really built into that culture from the moment of onboarding, really from recruitment on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=2589.01s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And can I just jump in on that, that culture and retention, it's one thing to get people into the district, having them stay, just to be really explicit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=2599.112s">[Reinfeld]</a>: If there's no belonging, that doesn't happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=2601.713s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=2954.452s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm curious what processes exist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=2958.362s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I don't know whether the end of this sentence is in our community or in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=2964.425s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm interested particularly in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=2968.626s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is your support of DEI efforts in the school and ADA efforts in the school, is that to help us develop the systems and processes we need?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=2976.57s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Do we have those in place?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=2978.47s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Where are we in this work?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5097.011s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I think the thing when you saw me go, is this the right resolution for right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5101.894s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It was me saying, is this, we cannot rely on Frances to do all of this work, but we can't have her not do this work either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5111.259s">[Reinfeld]</a>: This collaboration is so important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5113.88s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I, you know, I put my hat on of going, I went to the strategic plan and I look at all of these objectives and initiatives and,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5124.406s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Only some of them are covered, I know they're they're baked into a lot of what we do as a district, but to really put that front and center, understanding who is responsible for these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5137.342s">[Reinfeld]</a>: in many of these instances, is this a consultation or is this a responsibility?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5142.307s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And so I would like to see these are the responsibilities within the district in doing this work and how that interfaces with this valuable collaboration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5155.558s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I do think extending the partnership, the collaboration makes sense and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5165.524s">[Reinfeld]</a>: What does it mean to take it to the next level of what this looks like on the ground and with the students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5172.932s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I would support that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5210.446s">[Reinfeld]</a>: To continue to extend the stipend through the end of this fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5215.95s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Well, that's already, that's already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5220.493s">[Reinfeld]</a>: No, we had approved this through the end of the calendar year, but to move into the fiscal year to maintain the full collaboration at this level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5232.02s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Now that we have a sense of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5235.729s">[Reinfeld]</a>: what this means in practice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5321.593s">[Reinfeld]</a>: The consolidation on building on me, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5375.817s">[Reinfeld]</a>: To be really clear, I don't want to nickel and dime.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5378.418s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We're not trying to nickel and dime anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5380.38s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We're trying to provide fair compensation for work that is important and happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5462.118s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5463.079s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We have two more regular meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5474.787s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I'll just say that I would like the reality check of is the current stipend in the ballpark?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5485.754s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5488.274s">[Reinfeld]</a>: because if it needs to be significantly more, I want to know that by December, I'd like to make that happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5507.59s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And if no, rather than we stick with what we have, I think if we can't get a good number in that timeframe, what we have is the best we've got.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5532.536s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I mean, I probably, although I'm okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5537.498s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Does this does a within district position?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5540.879s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Does this make sense to the people in this room?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5579.299s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Because one of the things I think we heard from Francis early on is this is what this job isn't, or this is what this consultation and this partnership is not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5587.481s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I heard this group say, those are also things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5593.203s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Those are ands.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5595.703s">[Reinfeld]</a>: not oars, but hands.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5598.504s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5599.264s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I will mute myself now and let member Ruseau read.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5663.958s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5699.355s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes I appreciate being able to address this thoughtfully and not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5707.771s">[Reinfeld]</a>: in a sudden resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5790.869s">[Reinfeld]</a>: to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S3LvuQi6-yY&t=5795.171s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Oh no, I was making sure nobody else had something to say as I was speaking slowly, but hearing none, motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=5529.013s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, so I have a lot of questions about the transportation logistics and I, this is probably not the time because we need more specific proposals but the concerns about busing students from every single elementary school to every other corner of the city around seems like a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=5545.841s">[Reinfeld]</a>: huge challenge but I think we can't have that conversation until there are more specific sites, so I just wanted to ask about the SNL Sports Academy and partnering with local colleges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=5556.684s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Do they have the ability to provide that consistent program for the duration of the public school school year because a lot of college schedules are very different than the schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=5570.588s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It sounds a little bit like SNL Sports Academy does one-time events and provides programming in after-school programs that have a base core staff versus having, are the student athletes the ones who are responsible for the full-time staffing for the duration of the public school year starting in August, ending in June, and having<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=5597.666s">[Reinfeld]</a>: There are a lot of challenges that college students have throughout the year that take them away from a regular weekly commitment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=5606.992s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Anyone who's worked with college student workers knows that consistent staffing is a challenge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8636.851s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld, then Member Intoppa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8640.453s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I just wanted to say so they covered some of my, my question about the expanded program but I just want to say as you're thinking about the new schedule and the new pathways to definitely I just want to say publicly to make sure to talk with our arts department because I know they have a lot of ideas and are facing kind of that opposite challenge of under enrollment because of scheduling and the opportunity so I would love to see that proposal come to us as a coherent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8666.699s">[Reinfeld]</a>: You said lots of out-of-the-box thinking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8668.14s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I know they're already working on ideas there as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8672.402s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Exactly, and so I'm excited to see what's coming there because I think it is multiple sides of probably dice, not coins, to torture a metaphor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9192.254s">[Reinfeld]</a>: No, I just wanted to ask if this was a proposed change to the policy itself or if this was a for this year only given that we are like, we're looking at a proposed budget supplement and some restructuring based on the override results.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9247.051s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then I also just wanted to note that we have scheduled a budget hearing for February 26th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9252.853s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And so that's putting it right up at this deadline here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9274.441s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But we had voted to approve that schedule with the public hearing and then another optional public hearing if needed after the request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9285.467s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Maybe we could send you those dates, Jerry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9740.475s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9740.935s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So this was just to bring this request to the forefront.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9744.436s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm actually gonna make a motion to consolidate this with the following resolution because I would be happy to see this report, the summary of what our position responsibilities are looking like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9756.38s">[Reinfeld]</a>: to inform the next budget cycle to be part of the justification for the budget cycle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=10035.612s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, and I will just add this bit at the end of my resolution about limited to roles and responsibilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=10041.075s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That's just to say what I'm not looking for is a conversation about people's performances and how individual people are and are not meeting these responsibilities is what is the need, what are the responsibilities, and do we need to make that a permanent, do we need a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=10058.87s">[Reinfeld]</a>: temporary coverage for this role, or should this be built into the new budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=10063.711s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So just to clarify, it shouldn't need to be said confidential matters, stay confidential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=10068.312s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But I want to be really clear, this is about the need and the responsibilities that people have in the system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=10073.994s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I'm excited to have that conversation about how we can meet students needs through some of the supplemental funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=10092.967s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I don't want to make the administration prepare a report for our December 16th meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=10379.123s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinhold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=10381.064s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm fully in favor of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=10382.826s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Does this also place him on the Communications and Community Engagement Subcommittee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=10389.21s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is that a?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=10389.93s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, yeah, because I think that's really important here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=10392.712s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, he has.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=10393.833s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Well, has already said that he's been supporting it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=10396.035s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But is do we need to formally do that as we don't need to do that here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=10403.581s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm happy to motion for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=345.79s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=2225.21s">[Reinfeld]</a>: The accountability, oh, I guess I have to be called on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=2228.558s">[Reinfeld]</a>: You're the member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=2229.499s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm Phil.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=2230.44s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, the accountability percentile is that within the district?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=2234.904s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=2235.345s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I looked on the Desi site and it's it's compared to other schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=2239.789s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is that within the district or other schools with similar similar population statewide?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=3272.973s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=3274.454s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=3276.355s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So you've mentioned a couple of these key areas within ELA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=3280.838s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Do these results, these gaps, do they match what teachers are kind of reporting outside of the standardized test evaluation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=3291.484s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Because writing is definitely one of those things that you see a lot better in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=3300.14s">[Reinfeld]</a>: everyday classroom experiences rather than the standardized test model?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=3394.982s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think with the writing, it's just more of the output, the final product that was... Because I know students approach homework very differently than they approach, or in class exercises very differently than they approach<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=3434.361s">[Reinfeld]</a>: understand how good an indicator this particular test is on these really important skills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=3441.567s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=3441.907s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=4128.444s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=4129.826s">[Reinfeld]</a>: No, you're shocked, it was me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=4132.429s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Should we be expecting to see some similar wiggles with the new integrated math that's coming up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=4138.216s">[Reinfeld]</a>: You answered my question about, is this because we switched curricula at the elementary level?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=4142.702s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Should we be expecting this middle and high school as well in a couple of years?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=4196.194s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So we don't think things are gonna dip back, dip down the way they did in some of these areas here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=4201.176s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Or is that just, we can't predict that yet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=4242.841s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So- The MAP scores and the MCAS scores are matching up in terms of which areas are strong<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=4304.366s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=4304.646s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then as we look, as we think about staffing for future budget cycles, I know when we targeted certain literacy skills, we prioritized literacy specialists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=4315.934s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I know there was a period in MPS history when there were some math specialists in the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=4321.057s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is that something that we're looking at?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=4323.619s">[Reinfeld]</a>: What you described sounds like the structures around<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=4327.955s">[Reinfeld]</a>: team planning and scheduling with the trainings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=4332.182s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We're covering it with the existing staff and the teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=4336.449s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But is this something we should be thinking about as we look ahead?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=4400.185s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But we are not desperately suffering without them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=4403.587s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And these scores seem to support that we are making the progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=4408.409s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=4411.591s">[Reinfeld]</a>: All the things we could do with bigger budgets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=4415.153s">[Reinfeld]</a>: All right, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5444.897s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5445.918s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5447.098s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5448.319s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I remember you saying a few meetings ago that the reason people didn't pass was because they didn't show up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5454.243s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It was mostly an attendance issue rather than an instruction issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5458.286s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And on the Saturday and after school, those four, and I forget if it was four or three and the other ones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5465.931s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5467.688s">[Reinfeld]</a>: If additional remediation services are needed, is that interfering with people's ability to take elective classes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5476.17s">[Reinfeld]</a>: You alluded to the high school schedule and the constraints within the schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5483.572s">[Reinfeld]</a>: How does this affect people's ability to take?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5488.414s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I've seen that in other districts where the students who need MCAS support get pulled out of some of the other classes<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5498.277s">[Reinfeld]</a>: are really essential to wanting to be in school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5535.149s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5536.129s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I mean, because I know we have this challenge in elementary school of, like, my kid misses art in order to do strings, but sometimes she misses recess and science.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5548.075s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I didn't ask Dr. Seary, like we need more targeted science, but do we also need more time for science as well?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5555.237s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So trying to understand what's fighting with what to guess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5648.599s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you for laying that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6643.594s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6645.649s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, so I'm looking at this list and I'm incredibly grateful that we are getting that kind of support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6651.232s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm also a little concerned if we need all the support, putting that on someone in the city who already has quite a full time job, I could see this all being a part of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6662.797s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I think coordination is great, but it feels like maybe we need some more of the support built into the school structures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6675.682s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'll yield the floor to Member Olapade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7563.742s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I have a question before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7565.222s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7567.744s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, so the amendment is to allow the work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7571.426s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Every single bullet point here is work that is already happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7576.69s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That's correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7590.768s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And so this is work that's happening uncompensated or as part of the, this is part of the current position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7717.729s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That's an annual stipend?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7890.389s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think that's part of what I'd love to hear a subcommittee<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7894.369s">[Reinfeld]</a>: discuss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7894.849s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I mean, I can I can do the math and say, all right, if it were if we're looking at 7500 for a year, and we're talking about a temporary acknowledgement and compensation for this work, we divide by 12 multiply by two months for November and December, that puts us at 1250.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7912.779s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Which I think was member in tapas to accept this through the end of the year, at which point the subcommittee will have assessed<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7924.372s">[Reinfeld]</a>: and spoken with HR city schools to really figure out what is, what is the best use of, for instance, as time, what is the best use, what is the capacity within Medford public schools, because I really do think a lot of this capacity<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7945.707s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It has to be in the schools that diversity, equity, inclusion permeates everything we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7952.432s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And it's gotta be built in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7954.914s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It's gotta be part of the fabric of who we are and what we do and multiple people thinking of it, not just one person from the outside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7966.583s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That's not the authentic work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7969.656s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I think that Frances does fantastic work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7971.718s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I wanna be really clear about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7973.299s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7974.64s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I had no idea she was providing this support to the schools and I'm incredibly grateful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7982.047s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I don't want our students to suffer for these supports not being in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7988.252s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But I also think having one person do this work is not sustainable long-term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7994.578s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And so I support<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7996.977s">[Reinfeld]</a>: some acknowledgement of the temporary work, but not fully jumping on this model as written in perpetuity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8023.51s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I do not want her to burn out doing all this work for Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8029.034s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We need her too much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8135.225s">[Reinfeld]</a>: For the fiscal year 2025.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8136.185s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Fiscal year 2025, July 1.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8140.629s">[Reinfeld]</a>: the first half of fiscal year 2025.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8218.256s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And member Olapade,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8220.257s">[Reinfeld]</a>: You've done the motion to send it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8221.998s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8226.141s">[Reinfeld]</a>: You're right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8227.382s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'll put it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8245.714s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=157.043s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Sure, it is really hard to just to know we have another member online now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=513.706s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Before we go, yes, can I ask, so this seemed to be, when I went through it, very much aligned with the notes that came out of Department of Education and this fact sheet, the final rule fact sheet that has kind of the key components.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=528.17s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I'm wondering how much of this is the language that was already recommended versus specific to Medford, because I think I am confident that in having a policy that complies with federal law,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=544.505s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We shouldn't be debating a lot of those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=642.145s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Great, so I think going through it piece by piece and maybe having member Ruseau and Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=647.409s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Bowen provide a little bit of the guidance of this is what this is doing here or how it plays out would be helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=713.712s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I know it was what we what we were just looking at was the preamble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=717.034s">[Reinfeld]</a>: There's one piece that says sex discrimination that right there where your mouse was prohibits sex discrimination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=722.839s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Should that be sexual discrimination?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=727.222s">[Reinfeld]</a>: You know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=729.457s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Everything else is really consistent and then I didn't know if that was just left in as sex discrimination, but I promise I'm not, this was the only place I got that detail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=753.265s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm not inclined to go in and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=775.26s">[Reinfeld]</a>: My sense was that sexual discrimination was the term that was being used to cover all of these things laid out here, plus sexual harassment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1056.98s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is there a definition of the word consider?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1059.201s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Because it's not offer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1062.163s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It's not, like, I suspect that is one of those words that is legally, it means one thing in legal terms and the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1086.328s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Nope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1087.308s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Versus offering those supportive measures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1089.909s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Like, I feel like that's implied here, but it isn't explicit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1109.554s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It's provided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1119.969s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That says if you're not providing supportive measures, you have to say why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1123.932s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Like we went straight to disciplinary action for these reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1128.835s">[Reinfeld]</a>: There was an imminent danger.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1131.357s">[Reinfeld]</a>: This was not a safe environment in which to offer this supportive measure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1139.322s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1146.583s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It's the non-punitive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1410.039s">[Reinfeld]</a>: This may not qualify for this type of measure, but it could still be a violation of other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1546.694s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And we don't have any definitions of what a reasonable timeframe is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1574.65s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But there's separate language for acknowledgement of the receipt of the complaint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1645.558s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Remember, Randall wants to say something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1650.201s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1651.422s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So this is the section where I had a lot of questions, and I think it comes up in the bullying policy as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1657.125s">[Reinfeld]</a>: If there are more than two parties, if we're talking about a group,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1661.854s">[Reinfeld]</a>: like a team of people or multiple staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1667.558s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think there's a lot of confusion on what gets investigated on a person by person basis versus people as a group talking amongst themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1679.667s">[Reinfeld]</a>: If you have a group of students who is either filing a complaint or is being<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1688.928s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Or is the respondent or respondents, whether they're getting individual, whether all of these words, multiple things happening simultaneously versus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1699.039s">[Reinfeld]</a>: An investigation into a group situation, and that's not really addressed, and I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1707.488s">[Reinfeld]</a>: if there's guidance there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1709.91s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Obviously, I can try to talk to lawyers about that, but I don't know how that works in some of our other policies, because I know there has been a lot of concerns where I was told one thing and I was told another, and then parents start sharing with each other around the same situation, and there's just lots of conflicting information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1743.269s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1743.809s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I have examples that aren't Title IX specific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1749.31s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1750.77s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1751.711s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1752.411s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So for example, a group of middle schoolers is caught with vaping supplies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1763.271s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And each student is being, the investigation is happening individually with those students, but the outcomes of those end up being different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1776.078s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And so the parents, you know, suspension might happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1779.721s">[Reinfeld]</a>: One student is suspended, another one isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1783.291s">[Reinfeld]</a>: parents are comparing notes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1786.032s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And they're saying, this is what the administration told me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1788.632s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, well, this is what they told me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1790.313s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I can't release information about this other student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1794.574s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But the parent has given me this information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1796.554s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I want to bring that as part of my complaint, because my kids were together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1801.075s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Our kids were together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1802.776s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is that helpful?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1833.629s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Do that or want to know, like, what else is there's a video, the reviewing of evidence, like, there's a there's a video of something that happens and.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1842.035s">[Reinfeld]</a>: 1 complaint complainant can't review a video because it contains footage of another complainant, for example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1928.382s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Right, if there is collective bullying for a group of LGBTQ students or the school say, I don't think this is going to happen, but school is not providing adequate pumping space for new parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1962.088s">[Reinfeld]</a>: and we as a group want to file a complaint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1966.071s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Can we as a group file a complaint or does it have to be a series of individual complaints?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2124.653s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, the sports scenarios are coming to mind, and I'm trying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2129.475s">[Reinfeld]</a>: To note that, I mean, we are in a public meeting and so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2138.63s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, we were on page nine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2157.985s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, and I see, yeah, for any purpose not directly related to this grievance procedure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2164.795s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So if there is a interconnected investigation that remains within the single grievance or, okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2511.138s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And this might've been the previous section, but so there's this timeline talks about the elimination of conditions once the determination has been made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2524.02s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It doesn't, this policy doesn't seem to say a lot about while the investigation is going on, making sure things are safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2537.574s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, in advance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2539.522s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2541.148s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2589.619s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Does that supportive measure potentially include<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2595.325s">[Reinfeld]</a>: removal of the respondent or the alleged perpetrator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2629.909s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Because one of the real challenges of these situations is that a lot of the burden to remain safe is on the victim or alleged victim or complainant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2644.043s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And that can be really hard and further exacerbating of a situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2683.257s">[Reinfeld]</a>: but like administrative leave can't happen during it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2686.859s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And when does administrative leave?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2715.049s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Privacy challenges on both sides are significant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2718.23s">[Reinfeld]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2718.51s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2872.932s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I mean, an anonymous report is not a formal complaint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2878.936s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I think that's certainly where we've seen in higher education these things come out, is people saying, well, I can't do anything until a formal complaint is filed, and people don't feel safe submitting a formal complaint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2893.151s">[Reinfeld]</a>: whatever it is, but it's this horrible catch 22, maybe not even a catch 22, but a paradox of people just, people need to be good people, but.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2965.352s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, because I did have a question is we have one appeal officer and what happens if<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2972.378s">[Reinfeld]</a>: This is purely hypothetical, not based on the individual named, but what happens if the appeals officer is involved in this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2980.132s">[Reinfeld]</a>: There needs to be an alternative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3013.066s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I don't know, since you said part of this is about communicating what the avenues are, that was my question here is do we need to communicate that in the event of the designated person not being able to be that unbiased decision maker, these are the alternate paths.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3034.557s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It was only because that particular role had one person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3112.313s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That is how I take them as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3113.914s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I just was wondering about how explicit we need to be about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3118.737s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And just since we're in public, I like John Bruno very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3122.86s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Me too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3126.663s">[Reinfeld]</a>: At my child's school, just not picking on him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3416.789s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I have been trying to figure out a way to rephrase the phrase victim without their consent because it implies that a victim can give consent up in the definition section, but I haven't settled on anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3533.337s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Interpreter, but until it's been proven, they can't put that in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3544.406s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So they do say that alleged victim is a. Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3551.933s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That person, but that's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3616.496s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So does this automatically go to a regular meeting or do we waive?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3573.878s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I just want to comment kind of a combination of these last two questions about transparency in the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3578.479s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So member Graham already mentioned that the budget process is by law an open budgeting process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3584.041s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But I want to say we in Bethlehem Public Schools are in a really good position to be transparent about things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3589.983s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Our budget process got incredibly cleaned up by our last finance director who continues to consult one of the smoothest, most well accounted for budgeting that we've seen in quite a while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3601.866s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I was not school committee, but I watched the meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3604.487s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It is a clean budget book.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3605.767s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We know where the money's going, how it's being spent, and we're going to continue to have those public meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3610.148s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We have a new capital planning process policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3613.328s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We have open subcommittee meetings where these things are happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3616.469s">[Reinfeld]</a>: They're happening in public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3617.509s">[Reinfeld]</a>: These conversations, we are collecting input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3619.989s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So we are in a really good position to show what is happening in the schools, where the money is going, and how it is responding to the needs that we're hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3631.613s">[Reinfeld]</a>: from our department heads, from administration, from our vendors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3636.899s">[Reinfeld]</a>: This is a good time to be transparent and we're ready to do that with these questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4723.358s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I did look at these numbers when I was doing some of the analysis and our levels are back to where they were right before the pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4732.16s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So when people left the school to have their needs met elsewhere, they're coming back to Medford and they're coming back with significant need based on not just the pandemic, but just general student needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4748.724s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And so I think things are going up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4919.626s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I was just going to say, we got here because we made decisions that filled short-term needs, that were band-aids, and we didn't look.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4932.481s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Far ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5004.756s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We're making decisions based on the money that's available and what we can and can't do, not necessarily what is best for students in the long term from the school side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2140.529s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, so this presentation was very much about remediation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2143.852s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I am wondering, while we have these folks on the line, if there's anything we need to be keeping in mind for a new building that could potentially be coming to Medford in the next few years, we hope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2224.608s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Absolutely, of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2225.709s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Are there resources available to help with some of that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2229.25s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It's not remediation if it hasn't happened yet, but you mentioned grants for getting filling stations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2237.153s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is that sort of thing available for new installations?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4445.746s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4448.823s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I just wanted to ask if you are thinking about expanding the pool of drivers or what is the main impediment there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4456.79s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is it salary?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4458.271s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is it the timing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4459.332s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is it just a fixed thing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4460.693s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And the reason I'm asking is as we look to plan for the next few years, what are some things that we maybe could expect in order to get the pool of people we needed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4474.043s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think member Graham's questions around how we can support the people who are already there<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4479.15s">[Reinfeld]</a>: are really key, but looking at expanding the pool, like once people are in as drivers, do they stay or are we losing people partway through the year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4487.753s">[Reinfeld]</a>: What can we do to make sure we have more people?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4525.106s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4525.366s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And would we be looking at that going up in the future?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4527.587s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It's going to go up every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4651.843s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Like if we shifted school days, that's not going to make a difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4657.13s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I mean, I live right in Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1659.227s">[Reinfeld]</a>: My question is what of these<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1663.68s">[Reinfeld]</a>: can or should be bundled right does it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1666.322s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Do we need to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1668.224s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Does it help to do all the HVAC together because of a vendor or because of timing, or is everything here, like the roof rebuilds does it not matter which building it's on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2033.922s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, that reminds me of one of the resolutions we just had, I think last month or maybe it was the beginning of this month, around understanding what the needs to upgrade electrical systems to move away from fossil fuels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2049.485s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I realize that's not a specific project, but that's something we want to be planning for so that we're not kind of forced into making these decisions around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2062.308s">[Reinfeld]</a>: just on the basis of cost and availability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2067.309s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So that's an assessment that we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2152.518s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Though presumably that's the kind of thing, I guess then that question comes to the same question we had before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2159.284s">[Reinfeld]</a>: If we wait on that, does the price go up or down?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2161.506s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Because some capital projects, the price goes up if you don't do it right away, and sometimes it goes down significantly if you give it a year for the technology to catch up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2171.434s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So which direction does this lean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2176.378s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Do we know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2284.744s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So that, and so the cost of doing that is people's time, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2289.112s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Or is it time and training?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2292.385s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is it hiring of people?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2352.731s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, then my other question in terms of making this list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2357.796s">[Reinfeld]</a>: These are all the things that we know are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2362.6s">[Reinfeld]</a>: going to be big problems soon-ish.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2367.522s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is there a kind of middle tier list of things that we know are coming in the medium term, but if we don't proactively maintain them, they're going to get worse and become even exponentially more expensive to fix?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2382.409s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I'm thinking about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2385.615s">[Reinfeld]</a>: The analogy here is things like our roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2387.596s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It's a lot harder to repair roads that are severely weather damaged and potholes and all of this than to do maintenance on things that are showing wear and tear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2400.084s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And that saves us from doing desperate repairs later on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2406.108s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I know we didn't, I didn't ask you to prepare this in advance of this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2409.811s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So maybe this is a better question for November, but I want to think about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2416.963s">[Reinfeld]</a>: what we need to fix now to stop it from becoming a huge cost?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2643.626s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2644.426s">[Reinfeld]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2645.067s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2645.888s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I wanted to put those things out there as they have to be factored in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2650.952s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think we're probably at a point where we need to now start that prioritization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2821.024s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I mean, ADA compliance to me feels like we really need to get in compliance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2830.551s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But tell me more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2832.593s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I know we're waiting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2834.014s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I know we had identified some things at the high school, and I think we're waiting for member Branley to call the building and grounds meeting on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2843.441s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Does this go with that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2956.877s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I will recognize that I jumped on member Ruseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2959.217s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think he was also going to say something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2961.898s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We should see that we should finish this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3024.364s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I just moved that up with the like recommissioning assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3027.765s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I was going to say that category is recommissioning for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3053.311s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Sorry, one other thing on that one, on electrification, is that, is there any sort of grant to support that assessment for climate mitigation, for energy, alternative energies?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3073.98s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3077.145s">[Reinfeld]</a>: but that seems like something that should be supported.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3160.415s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Well, and on the drainage, is there any, I know that's something that you were really thinking about with the new McGlynn playground because, I mean, that playground was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3173.14s">[Reinfeld]</a>: regularly not draining to understatement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3186.009s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So it's not a drainage issue, but there is a drainage issue there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3192.374s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I was just wondering if there's a service contract to be maintaining<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3198.072s">[Reinfeld]</a>: this turf setting, does it also, is it possible to bundle that with the other school, even though they're, however- I believe the turf is being, I believe we are finally on the maintenance contract at the Brooks, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3214.777s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3217.418s">[Reinfeld]</a>: With the door sweeps, there was also a dumpster mitigation that I wrote down that I don't see in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3226.368s">[Reinfeld]</a>: the general, there were two pest control issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3285.232s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And that's all one project?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3286.592s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That should all be in line 27 or are they separate lines?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3592.113s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, part of my question on that is, what does that do to summer programs that we're offering in different schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3600.481s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I know most of our programming this summer was at Missittuck and high school, unless I'm missing something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3610.811s">[Reinfeld]</a>: In the Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3612.232s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3761.242s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, as I recall, there's the determination based on what the project is, and then there's also a funding threshold, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3767.707s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Because I'm looking, if I'm remembering correctly, and I might not be, it was 250,000 was a cutoff, and I'm looking right there at network closet mini split.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3784.019s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I don't know what borderline is gonna dictate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3787.754s">[Reinfeld]</a>: how things are classified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3788.935s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So if that's if we need to look at that quote a little more carefully for that determination, we might need to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3798.302s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I'm sure knows that number much better than I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3835.523s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I mean, the only thing that comes to mind is we have talked about getting elementary school students into middle school spaces, whether it's after school or some other reorganization down the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3851.949s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I don't know that that is concrete enough, but I know that when I spoke to Nick Tucci, for example, the concerns around having elementary school students in there would require some changes to classrooms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3872.338s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I don't know what the timeframe is that maybe the superintendent knows that a little bit better or somebody who's been talking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3878.061s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I know we're due to get an update on after school at the Andrews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3882.243s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But that is something that is potentially a capital project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3892.249s">[Reinfeld]</a>: If we're looking at changing who is in the middle school building, the what are currently the middle school buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3918.303s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, quite capital, but right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3921.164s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That's a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3944.21s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I guess, Dr. Cushing, you mentioned the roof as being ready for solar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3950.251s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Are there other solar projects that are possibilities down the line?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3957.361s">[Reinfeld]</a>: you mentioned that for the Andrews, are we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4059.608s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4060.889s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4061.209s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I was talking to a third grader who apparently they like to be fed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4066.372s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4067.032s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It's weird.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4068.253s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4072.446s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, fourth grade, whoops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4073.807s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Anyway, I was gonna say, I think this is when I was having audio trouble, but anything Curtis Tufts, I assume that those calculations are being made with MSBA thinking in mind of what's worth doing in a building if we really are looking to co-locate and that five to seven, sorry, five year plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4098.926s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4227.081s">[Reinfeld]</a>: No, we have that date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4228.402s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4267.302s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So does that take the place of adjournment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4269.422s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That is correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4270.043s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9508.884s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Can we see a copy of what the baseline numbers look like?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9514.869s">[Reinfeld]</a>: What is elevated?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9515.909s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is zero the baseline on everything?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10349.916s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I have three questions, two of them for Director Perry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10353.86s">[Reinfeld]</a>: You said HECAT framework changes to curriculum end of year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10357.043s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is that end of calendar year or end of school year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10365.401s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10366.081s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then I was wondering at the middle school level, how the reduction in guidance Councilors has affected the delivery of health education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10373.662s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I know that was a big question during budget season about the teaching responsibilities with that position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10398.553s">[Reinfeld]</a>: have other, do they have room in their schedule for other activities?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10402.294s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That was one of the things that concerns were expressed about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10418.52s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10419.06s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then my third question was just to confirm that the caregiver university is an a la carte model.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10424.462s">[Reinfeld]</a>: People can tune in and out to different sessions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10426.863s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It's not an enrollment based.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10429.292s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13062.046s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13062.846s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, I was just wondering what opportunities there are for teachers to give feedback or share<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13069.892s">[Reinfeld]</a>: how well it is working for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13071.413s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I realize there's still a lot of training going on, but that formative assessment of, is this curriculum working for us and for the people who are delivering it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13079.577s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I can see a lot of these meetings coming, we're looking at the student data and we're really focused on the students, which is absolutely important, but I, where the teacher voice and their experience, is that happening in the PD sessions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13096.305s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is that happening in the weekly meetings?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13196.451s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And participation on the DLT is volunteer basis?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13200.635s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13201.455s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And we don't turn anybody away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13205.358s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But there's no stipend?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13487.255s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I would like to amend this the same way I amended last week's to include nicotine pouches and non, we have the phrasing in last week's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13496.929s">[Reinfeld]</a>: minutes to include nicotine pouches and state exclusion of prescription nicotine products, such as patches prescribed to end nicotine dependence and addiction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9683.445s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I sort of hate to ask this, and this is not to curtail artistic integrity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9689.886s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Either do we have community standards for what gets painted, or is there a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9697.117s">[Reinfeld]</a>: protocol in place if somehow something that shouldn't be in the lot shows up in the lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9707.383s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I trust our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9708.764s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think they're great, but I just want to have that backup.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9735.177s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I'm not a fan of censorship.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9737.278s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I just wanted, things can happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10150.718s">[Reinfeld]</a>: All those opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10153.759s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I have a question about the $75 to park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10156.16s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is that just during school hours?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10157.88s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Because I have seen in districts where you're not parking during the day, but if you are doing some sort of activity that has you there late at night, sports things, theater things run in, sometimes the car comes in after when bus service isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10206.578s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I just want to say that I...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10209.372s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, I think we shouldn't be charging people to get to school, but we charge for people to take the bus, and I don't think that parking should be free when we're charging families to pay for their own T-passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10223.575s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think there's inequity and environmental impact to that decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10790.737s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10791.777s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10792.198s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So my goal here is to give this body the opportunity to articulate how these ballot questions map to the needs of our school community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10800.803s">[Reinfeld]</a>: These are the three questions that I believe most directly affect the student and educator experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10806.927s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I do intend to divide this motion so that each component can be voted on separately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10812.29s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm happy to do that now or give an overview of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10818.455s">[Reinfeld]</a>: of what I've laid out here, described the ballot question, mapped it to the needs, and articulated a position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10826.16s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm happy to note rate question two is about eliminating the MCAS test, not as a required assessment, but as a graduation requirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10834.806s">[Reinfeld]</a>: This is something that Medford educators and parents have been asking for for many years, and it allows our educators to better focus on diverse learning styles, needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10845.173s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It expands the definition of success.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10847.202s">[Reinfeld]</a>: reduces anxiety, and increases equity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10850.645s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Question seven is a direct response to the budget crisis that we saw last spring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10855.029s">[Reinfeld]</a>: To replace those one-time funds, we all, I assume, remember how devastating the $2.7 million worth of cuts, plus the 2.2 million that we didn't even identify what those would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10867.821s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So that's valid question seven, along with the...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10872.385s">[Reinfeld]</a>: The Department of Public Works, we've spent a lot of time talking about transportation and how there are not necessarily viable alternatives for our families and students within certain distances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10882.911s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Some of that is on busing, which is also addressed by the ballot initiatives, but also on street and sidewalk repair, which makes safer environments for everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10893.097s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then question eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10894.935s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think really addresses the challenges, these underlying challenges that we have seen come up, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10901.258s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We heard enrollment in the arts is low and it's not because students don't want to be taking arts, it's because they don't have room in their schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10908.861s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Many people enrolled in vocational programs aren't able to take the AP courses that will assist in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10915.243s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And so I just found out that my fourth grader in taking<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10921.471s">[Reinfeld]</a>: starting an instrument is probably going to be missing art class or science class every week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10928.253s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And that's a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10931.794s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And so we need to expand what we offer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10934.435s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We probably need to expand the teacher workday, the student learning opportunities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10940.217s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We are at the state minimum for how much time students, instructional time students have in class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10946.218s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But if we're gonna ask people to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10949.496s">[Reinfeld]</a>: to spend more time in the classroom, we have to pay them for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10952.197s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We found out how low many of our stipends are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10956.379s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We have been hearing for years about competition with other districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10961.14s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And so that is question eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10965.042s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then the final section of this motion is an acknowledgement that this doesn't solve all the problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10969.803s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We are still committed as a body to working to make sure<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10974.798s">[Reinfeld]</a>: our students and educators have what they need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10977.761s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I welcome edits or additions from my colleagues, and I really appreciate the opportunity to articulate how these three valid questions impact our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11005.473s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So what's our definition?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11013.619s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, it says this test is not the key thing that says yes or no, you graduate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11420.451s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think we, sorry, I think, Simon, are you here for this question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11425.613s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm so sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11426.514s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We have our frequent flyer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11430.576s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Would you like to speak?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11489.402s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I have some, I have a couple of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11491.263s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11492.124s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm curious what happened to the language about student use and signage from the original policy or what's online?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11519.244s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11519.704s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So on that one, I would want to add nicotine pouches and gum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11524.445s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I'm not sure if that belongs in the staff one as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11527.886s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But that's a non-tobacco product, but it is, this is things like Zin and yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11539.569s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So it's not tobacco, but it is nicotine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11542.209s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11552.743s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Nicotine pouches.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11555.764s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I actually wasn't sure about gum because I know some people need that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11559.366s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I don't know what our school policy is on gum actually, but I know that's helping to combat addiction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11572.431s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think we should.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11573.571s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Not patches, pouches, the pop in your mouth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11581.63s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, I have our assistant super chair saying yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=128.409s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to sever June 24th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=153.433s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'd like to amend the approval of the teacher budget line item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=157.434s">[Reinfeld]</a>: The vote was 5-0-2, not 5-1-1.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=161.116s">[Reinfeld]</a>: There were two abstentions, no no votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1676.263s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1677.404s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is there a limitation on the number of schools from a district who can apply for this kind of thing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1693.899s">[Reinfeld]</a>: because I love this and you know I have a kid at the Roberts, so I'm super excited, but I also want to be thinking about our other elementary schools and equity across the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1903.465s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2874.85s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So there were 90 enrolled, 30 got to do Summer Fun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2877.891s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Were there people who wanted to do Summer Fun that didn't get to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3213.001s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So the students who didn't pass, what support is available?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3217.003s">[Reinfeld]</a>: What happens next for them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3879.437s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Remind me from June, this was to cover the program for one year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3883.06s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Remind me of the scope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3903.401s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So remember Ruseau touched on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3904.843s">[Reinfeld]</a>: What was the percentage of students who accepted?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3908.285s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We talked a lot in June about strategies for outreach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3961.961s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, do we have an opportunity to compare the students who participated with the students who didn't, whether that's through early DIBELS, early MAP, or even qualitative?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4011.953s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Because it would just be interesting to see if there was any kind of significant shift in scores comparing, looking across the cohort that was invited, those who participated and those who didn't, assuming they were on similar tiers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4025.247s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4025.607s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then my last question is, it seems like there was a lot of great teacher feedback about the format and how this works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4031.753s">[Reinfeld]</a>: How can we use the lessons that were learned in this summer experience to apply them or scale them up as we're looking at more intensive literacy training with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4044.95s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Hill and others?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5672.463s">[Reinfeld]</a>: May I ask what that looks like?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5675.684s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is that initiated by school committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5677.404s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is that initiated by the district?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5725.509s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And the population is changing a lot in Fulton Heights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6045.567s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I would love to see that committee of the whole meeting happen this fall once those numbers are presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6507.321s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Well, I would like to motion that the capital planning subcommittee in an upcoming meeting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6513.996s">[Reinfeld]</a>: dedicate an agenda item to identifying a scope and timeline for coordinated electrification across the district, because we can't keep doing this on a one-off as things fail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6524.958s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, this one's too expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6526.898s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And they all end up being too expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6528.819s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We have to do this look big picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6531.219s">[Reinfeld]</a>: This was the last one to fail, but what's next?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6537.24s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6539.621s">[Reinfeld]</a>: The capital planning subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6541.001s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6547.844s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Do you need more language?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6549.524s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I got enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6550.365s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6929.215s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm just curious why this wouldn't go towards other transportation related costs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6934.856s">[Reinfeld]</a>: If it is a parking fee for vehicles and a. Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7238.561s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reichelt?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7239.321s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm just curious whether we get any remuneration from these companies that delayed our process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7245.783s">[Reinfeld]</a>: You said they accepted full responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7249.024s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is that just an I'm sorry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7304.163s">[Reinfeld]</a>: No, it sounds like the project is going as smoothly as it can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7307.185s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I just want to thank the McGlynn Elementary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7308.846s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I know, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7310.347s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank the McGlynn Elementary community for their patience on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9454.002s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reindell?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9454.422s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Quick question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9455.263s">[Reinfeld]</a>: The priority on local produce, I absolutely see it reflected in the lunches.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9460.49s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Can we also expect to see it reflected in the breakfasts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9463.936s">[Reinfeld]</a>: which I think tend to be a little more carbon packaged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9664.853s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I love the efficiency of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9666.273s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I just want to make sure we're being aware of the effect that certain LED lights can have on headaches, migraines for the student health reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9677.808s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9678.068s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So just something to keep in mind proactively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9681.175s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10151.63s">[Reinfeld]</a>: there any other motions associated with this policy motion to waive this is this the sort of thing where we can waive the second reading because this is very much aligned with the massachusetts association of school committee recommendations so motion to waive the second reading i don't think we should do that no all right withdraw the motion okay so this will be on the agenda again next week for a final reading got it<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10247.004s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I had a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10248.084s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10248.525s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So my only question is if this is something that we need to hear from the department that's requesting the field trip or we need to acknowledge the grant by some terms of the grant, we would then just sever it from the consent agenda to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10260.809s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10261.369s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LWQCkV2s9zM&t=503.182s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LWQCkV2s9zM&t=505.323s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I have a quick question and then I'm happy to make a motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LWQCkV2s9zM&t=509.686s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm curious what collaborative budgeting looks like to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LWQCkV2s9zM&t=512.788s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Like how do you work with other people on the leadership team and in the administration and schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LWQCkV2s9zM&t=521.514s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Like how does that play out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LWQCkV2s9zM&t=693.134s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=2698.695s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5717.259s">[Reinfeld]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5718.881s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5721.958s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I was going to ask about targeted follow-up, because we know that response rates tend to be low among some of your invited populations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5729.943s">[Reinfeld]</a>: My other question is, how are you going to be measuring the success of the institute?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5734.806s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is it comparing the people who did it and didn't, who were all issued invitations?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5738.849s">[Reinfeld]</a>: How do we know that this program worked?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5837.55s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5919.105s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=6085.043s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'll amend my motion to include those dates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6128.574s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6191.823s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yep, I don't have a lot to share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6193.004s">[Reinfeld]</a>: This was really a foundational meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6194.406s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We had a great crowd of people who gave us an overview of what was happening and we're moving forward towards phase two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9344.116s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to waive this reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9363.169s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9365.21s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm wondering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9365.691s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9771.252s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to waive the definitions reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10573.524s">[Reinfeld]</a>: have another minor text.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10576.265s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think it was in section eight, part D. I can just send this to you, but to move that phrase to approve the proposed reconciled budget to after meeting, so special school committee meeting to approve the proposed reconciled budget will be scheduled no less than five business days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10597.751s">[Reinfeld]</a>: You stumbled over it when reading it the same way that I stumbled over it at home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10605.303s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I did have a question on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10609.106s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So you talk in phase two about discussing the budget needs with the principals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10613.949s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I was wondering about the department heads and potentially that's part of the presentations we get regularly from the departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10623.539s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I don't know if that's part of the budget process, or if it's part of the updates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10627.222s">[Reinfeld]</a>: This is what we've been doing, this is where we are, and this is what we anticipate needing for next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10631.486s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So build some of that strategic planning into those updates that we're already getting, or if not, make sure it's in the process of crafting the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10641.836s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think one of the big questions that people have had, that I've seen from people is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10648.737s">[Reinfeld]</a>: who exactly, how are we getting these numbers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10651.279s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Why are we, what is the plan for this department and that department and what are their needs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10656.262s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I know it's allocated by school and the principals are really important, but thinking about the departments and giving us a better sense of where those numbers and allocations are coming from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10666.849s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Because I think that also informs how we spend our money and what our priorities are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10826.19s">[Reinfeld]</a>: My question was how do we make transparent those priorities, not just in the individual schools, but across the areas, the department areas,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10961.706s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Then maybe what I'm asking is if that budget presentation can be tied more closely to the strategic plan and the direction that we're headed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11127.947s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=11128.307s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I don't support doing the same work over and over, to be clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=23.683s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=24.665s">[Reinfeld]</a>: All right, how many years have we been Zooming?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=27.43s">[Reinfeld]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=30.56s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So please be advised that there will be a meeting of the Curriculum, Instruction, Assessment, and Accountability Subcommittee of the Medford School Committee on Tuesday, May 28th, five o'clock p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=51.176s">[Reinfeld]</a>: The meeting is being recorded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=61.624s">[Reinfeld]</a>: The Zoom ID number is 926-407-5749.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=68.528s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So we will start with a roll call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=71.07s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Do I do the roll call as the chair or does Paul, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=75.973s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Branley?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=78.215s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=79.376s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Ruseau?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=81.604s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld, present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=83.066s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Three, present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=84.328s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Zero, absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=85.47s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And we are joined by members of the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=89.976s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I believe some members of the public as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=91.939s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you all so much for coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=94.702s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So this is the follow up on the resolution<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=98.027s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I don't actually have the resolution number in front of me, but be it resolved that the Subcommittee for Curriculum Instruction, Assessment, and Accountability meet with the Assistant Superintendent of Academics and Instruction and other relevant staff to discuss the development of a process to review and assess recently adopted curricula and assessment tools across the district and to identify the key stakeholders, timelines, and protocols to be involved in these reviews consistent with the policies described in Section<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=125.651s">[Reinfeld]</a>: of the Medford School Committee Online Policy Manual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=130.302s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So by way of context, we've called this meeting because in recent years, the Medford Public Schools have adopted a number of new curricular materials through a robust process of review and input and stakeholder input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=144.573s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And we would like to have the ability to assess whether our goals for adopting those materials are being achieved and what that looks like in terms of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=155.582s">[Reinfeld]</a>: the materials themselves, as well as the instruction and the student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=159.325s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And by way of further context, in the Medford Public Schools strategic plan, item A1 is to establish an ongoing process of curriculum review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=170.511s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I'm happy to pull up that document with the details of that, but I've asked Dr. Galusi to give us an update on where we are, because phase one<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=180.217s">[Reinfeld]</a>: is slated for 2021 through 2024 and here we are in 2024 and we'd like to get ahead of the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=188.243s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I think if we start with an update on phase one and then discuss what phase two looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=194.887s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is it useful to say who's in the room here from the schools before we do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=256.823s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Hi there, Jennifer Skane, Principal of Andrews Middle School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=447.49s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I don't think we should dive deep, but just to get a sense of what that looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1210.359s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Ruseau, did you have any questions, particularly as someone who's seen a lot of these curricula come in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1218.249s">[Reinfeld]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1218.75s">[Reinfeld]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1219.151s">[Reinfeld]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1221.437s">[Reinfeld]</a>: All right, so I think what we want to do, so this gives us a really good foundation for what's been done, what's in progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1228.499s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think one of the goals in calling this subcommittee at this point in time is to say, so some of these things are due to be evaluated regularly, and that process is in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1242.482s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But one of the things I want to be really thoughtful about is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1247.784s">[Reinfeld]</a>: that there are a few different stages of assessing these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1250.507s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I know this is ridiculous for me to say with this many educators on the call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1257.273s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But one of the things that I've been thinking about in regards to this is that didactic triangle where the content is one piece of a triangle and the students and the teachers are the other points and assessing the content.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1271.227s">[Reinfeld]</a>: isn't just about the content itself, but it's about the relationship that that content has to the teachers and the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1277.935s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think the review process isn't necessarily a conversation about the teacher-student relationship, but it is to the content and the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1286.424s">[Reinfeld]</a>: into the teachers and the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1288.046s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And so some of that looks like, for the content and the teachers, that looks like the implementation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1293.631s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And is this doing, is this working?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1297.474s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Are these things being implemented with fidelity and in a way that the teachers are adequately trained to teach this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1304.16s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then that seems to me something that needs to come earlier than the process of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1310.666s">[Reinfeld]</a>: assessing whether the students have mastery of the content or whether they're in well hopefully the engagement with the content is coming sooner and to be able to assess that through observations through test scores whatever it is and what that process looks like so it's not just we're looking at everything all together once we hit<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1330.25s">[Reinfeld]</a>: the six years or the curriculum expires in 2029.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1332.912s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So we're just deciding if we're gonna renew it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1336.633s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'd like to make sure that we have a process in place to review that in a strategic targeted way at selected points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1344.938s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And you all on the call know far better than I do what is feasible, because as we all know, the more time you spend talking to people about what they're doing, that's less time that they're actually doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1355.803s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So figuring out what that balance is, is something that I'd like to kind of lay out in terms of the timeline, who the stakeholders are, and the role that different people are going to be playing in a review process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1539.375s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1539.535s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I would love to hear from the folks on the ground there as you know, is, is map testing giving you the information you need and what other information do you need?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1549.138s">[Reinfeld]</a>: What are, what are the ways to get that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1550.798s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Because I think as we all know, we, we don't all want it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1554.88s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We don't want to just make test scores the measure of success.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1558.401s">[Reinfeld]</a>: What are the, what are the metrics we need here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1879.366s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I just don't want to lose sight of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1881.187s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So the scope of this meeting is about assessing the curricula, not necessarily student gains.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1886.068s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Obviously, part of the goal of these curricula is to reflect student gains, but to make sure that we're measuring something that tells us whether the goals of adopting a given curriculum are being met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1898.172s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But I see hands in the air.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1899.672s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I think Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1900.312s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Demos was first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=1906.912s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, did we lose her?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2089.123s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And sorry, Mr. Tixera, the list that we just saw from Dr. Galussi of the curricula, how many of those have the built-in ELA support?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2099.409s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I know it was included versus a separate curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2202.636s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2255.151s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2256.511s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That actually, if anyone else has comments, I welcome them, but that seems like a reasonable transition to identify.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2317.433s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2319.284s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And that speaks to the other kind of takeaway I wanted to get from this, which is the timeline of when that, it sounds like MAP provides a lot of flexibility for doing a lot of that in real time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2330.269s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And if that is embedded in the process, I don't know how much more explicit it needs to be, but I'm interested in kind of identifying who are the stakeholders in making those decisions and getting that input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2343.494s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I know when curricula is chosen, it's done with community input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2347.336s">[Reinfeld]</a>: from families, obviously a lot of, most of the folks in families are not educators or curriculum developers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2354.701s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So, but they can speak to the experiential component of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2360.245s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And of course, the teachers who are teaching it saying this is working, this is not working anecdotally, qualitatively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2367.611s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So identifying who those parties are and when they come into the review process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2374.556s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think would be a useful exercise for this call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2575.973s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Are there thoughts from the group on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2580.657s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And also giving some attention to non-MCAS subjects as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2586.602s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I know we've been talking about NWEA MAP, but a lot of the math and the literacy is baked into things where there's a little more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2599.684s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I don't want to say leeway in other programs, because it is they're absolutely rigorous and to standards, but how can we make sure that's being included in this process and that those programs are getting what they need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2728.479s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2728.919s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And that speaks to another question I had for this group, which is the cross-departmental influence, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2737.925s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I see Mr. Cieri is on the call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2740.506s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Do our students taking advanced science classes have the advanced math skills that they need to do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2747.17s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And what room in reviewing curricula saying,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2750.732s">[Reinfeld]</a>: The next grade is getting students are coming in with the knowledge that they need to succeed at this grade and with this curriculum or looking at across you know do a piece does the statistics department have the statistics students have these math skills or these critical thinking skills that come from a humanities program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2769.015s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And so I'm wondering what cross-curricular opportunities there are to say this is a program that speaks to multiple needs, and certainly at the elementary school level, foundational math, foundational reading, but being able to make those connections across areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2796.513s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Do either of you wanna?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2798.214s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And particularly in terms of being able to review curricula with that in mind, not just are the students getting these things, but.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=2996.554s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And that taps into a question that we had brought up earlier of, is it the material?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3001.396s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is it the implementation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3002.597s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is it the instruction?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3003.878s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And really being able to assess it out, because we don't want to throw out a curriculum that has a lot of potential and would be doing well if there were more training.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3015.323s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But we also don't want to keep hammering away at a curriculum that isn't working.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3021.426s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I saw two hands go up, although one of them, I think, just went down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3178.263s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That's another great point that I think is not quite this meeting, but when a teacher brings a curriculum to the district and how that gets adopted and assessing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3191.83s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So that's a great point as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3195.132s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Nicole?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3307.877s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3308.317s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I think that was kind of the goal of this of getting this group together to have this conversation is to say, what does that process look like?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3317.342s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And what is the timeline for that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3321.104s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I don't know if that becomes a question with with the strategic plan for the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3326.267s">[Reinfeld]</a>: As we said, the phase one is coming to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3330.737s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Coming to an end this year and knowing what that phase two is, is something that I can speak for myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3339.422s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I hope the rest of the subcommittee agrees we'd like to know what, as we approach the end of phase one, what does phase two look like, who's involved, and what's the timeline?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3527.803s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3528.724s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm noting that it's six.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3529.845s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I would love to see this draft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3533.287s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3534.067s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But I do notice it is the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3536.229s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I think, especially in those instances where we're looking at, I don't want to call them Frankenstein curricula, but to say there's a gap in this published material that we need to supplement with either something homegrown or some other published material.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3713.991s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, although I will say I love the reasons for initiation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3716.832s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think that's really important to make explicit that some of it is scheduled, some of it is emerging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3725.036s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And some of it is external.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3729.258s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3732.079s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And do you have a target timeline for this process from adoption to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3743.024s">[Reinfeld]</a>: For these stages, you said we could spend a few years in implementation and monitoring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3748.325s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3818.155s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think it's five, my daughter was in second grade and my other one's in third now, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3847.861s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I don't think it's fully up to date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3850.385s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3857.915s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3858.195s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3858.335s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I think it's useful for this, if not the subcommittee or even the entire school committee to know when is it reasonable to say, all right, into readings been in place now, we need this up, we need an update on whether it's achieved its goals or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3873.287s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Cause I know school committee approves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3875.128s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We don't teach, we don't tell teachers how to teach, but we do approve major investments in curricula.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3881.512s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And so knowing when it's reasonable to see those updates, that data, those data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3892.016s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3893.917s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And so mapping out where those are for the various curricula.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3926.803s">[Reinfeld]</a>: have anything to add.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3928.484s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3929.824s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Anyone else have anything to add?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3931.325s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I know this was kind of a preliminary meeting, and it was for many of you laying out some of the things that you've been already working on for a couple of new school committee members, but it is very much appreciated, especially after hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3944.83s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Um member Brandly or member member Ruseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3947.031s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Did you have any other<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3962.082s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3963.383s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I think I am.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3964.363s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3969.386s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I'm excited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3970.167s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm excited to see this, this next stage of the process laid out and to understand where we are with the various curricula so that we can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3979.502s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We can come to you when it is appropriate and not make extra work asking questions and when they're not, when the answer is forthcoming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=3999.286s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=4001.466s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Brandly, Member Ruseau, is there- Can we go to a door?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=4009.371s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=4010.232s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is there a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=4011.733s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=4013.274s">[Reinfeld]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=4014.375s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Roll call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=4015.215s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Branley?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=4017.757s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=4019.158s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Ruseau?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=4021.08s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=4022.04s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/njO2v-AZ2UM&t=4022.641s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you all so much, and I look forward to continued conversation on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=779.15s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=782.03s">[Reinfeld]</a>: No, my question is how this intersects with the building and grounds subcommittee, but I think your question was more directly related to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=943.683s">[Reinfeld]</a>: No, that makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=944.364s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So the other thing I was going to say, when you said it's time for the school to take this back and make the decision, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=949.587s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But I think we need to build into whatever our procedure is, a regular like report out according to the city or according because we need to be in their plan in their capital planning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=961.716s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1011.466s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Their presentation is not intended to be at that level of detail, which is why I like what they're doing, you know, they're turning all municipal roofs to solar right like we want in on that we've got a part of that right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1249.095s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1249.815s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1457.921s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Round opens July 31st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1460.083s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Eligibility forms due September 10th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1462.706s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Full applications due October 8 and 22nd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1468.311s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That's for this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1480.462s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I love that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1481.462s">[Reinfeld]</a>: In special circumstances, off-cycle applications may be considered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1484.643s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Applicants must demonstrate an emergent public need and evidence of seeking alternative funding to the grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1511.818s">[Reinfeld]</a>: way ahead of the game and like here's the list of things and we're just sitting around waiting for you know the the free cash certification city's budget picture to come become clear yeah okay um in response to your comment about the principles and i think we need some threshold guidelines on what constitutes okay little project i like that yeah i<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1883.632s">[Reinfeld]</a>: All-day refrigeration, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1887.975s">[Reinfeld]</a>: ADR systems automatically adjust HVAC.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1954.431s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm so sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1954.951s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Does anyone have nut allergy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1956.712s">[Reinfeld]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2255.717s">[Reinfeld]</a>: To what extent does Waterheed's failure at the Brooks predict Robert's?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2262.95s">[Reinfeld]</a>: They already failed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2263.811s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2300.73s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I live in an old high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2307.394s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Maybe the condo conversion in 84.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2330.423s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I just want to be able to put that on our board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2331.543s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That was eligibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2332.764s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So you should be submitting a letter before you do a poll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2336.445s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2363.043s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2363.383s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And what year was that in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2365.664s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That's like early when we started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2369.106s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2369.286s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Wow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2559.482s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We made a to-do list for Peter of things that he was going to look into.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2562.952s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2585.16s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That's not why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2638.772s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, do you need any, do we need to include any information about the relationship with building and grounds and or the road?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=3046.488s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is it worth making a presentation on this to the MSBA building committee or not yet or, or, I mean, I know, I know, I know that she did the podcast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=3056.993s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=3070.821s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I believe I signed up for Thursday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=3073.722s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=3074.582s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm waiting for the official.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=3076.633s">[Reinfeld]</a>: calendar you're good yeah at least you just said she was gonna send one so yeah okay but it's in my calendar i'm skipping another meeting for it sounds great sounds like better than whatever meeting that was yeah um okay is there a motion to adjourn motion to adjourn so seconded by right bill all those in favor aye<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=447.864s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to sever the public hearing minutes and the behavioral and special ed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=463.259s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'd like to amend the minutes to the Special Education and Behavioral Health Subcommittee to include a link to the meeting recording, because I believe that the feedback provided by the representatives from Curtis-Tufts should be easily accessible with the record of the votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=493.413s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I'd also like to strike from the public hearing minutes the home address of the students who provided public comment for privacy reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=506.976s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And just put the- Just put their names that they spoke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=512.557s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I don't think their home address should be on public record for students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=833.992s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, we would like to give the administration and school councils a chance to confirm that this works for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=844.1s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Withdrawn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4200.421s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Rheintald?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4201.381s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I have a question about the survey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4203.902s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I was also incredibly encouraged by the numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4207.303s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I am wondering if there's gonna be any effort to break down particularly cultural awareness and action and diversity inclusion, those questions by some of the more vulnerable populations to see whether the average across the student population may not be representative of those people who are often targeted by some of these challenges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4225.77s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I'm wondering if we can look a little more closely to see<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4230.877s">[Reinfeld]</a>: what that sub data looks like there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4253.351s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4253.991s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then this might be a question for the superintendent so the Welch report had a lot of focus on the high school on there was also some of this mentoring for other schools in the district and looking at climate, kind of, more broadly across the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4266.68s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And so I'm wondering what's happening on that front.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4327.369s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4328.209s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I agree completely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4329.69s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I just want to make on record the comment that our, you know, our middle school students are the next high schoolers and elementary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4336.052s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So this all this work really has to be district wide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4339.193s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I'm so encouraged by this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4341.154s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4341.834s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And thanks to everyone who made it possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5330.169s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5335.134s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5383.507s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Are we going to need a break in the middle do we need to take our, like, two minute break now or if you want a motion to recess for five minutes, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9030.472s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9031.493s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you member on top of for summarizing some of those emails because we all got them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9036.456s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So, these numbers didn't change since the last meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9041.299s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I will also repeat myself from the last meeting, which is to say there are no good solutions here there's only least bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9048.903s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But what I want to know is what are the other options here, we you know we.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9053.866s">[Reinfeld]</a>: This looks terrible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9055.467s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Having no money and shutting down the schools is also terrible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9058.71s">[Reinfeld]</a>: What other things were considered what can we, what can we expect here what if this is the best what, what did we not do to make this happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9070.22s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then, particularly in terms of the extenuating circumstances numbers I think we've done a great job of presenting the big picture and how much money is here, but we got a lot of information about what those on the ground numbers are how many appointments are happening how many.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9085.698s">[Reinfeld]</a>: IEP is how many particular needs are happening at the Mississauga across health services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9090.48s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I don't see any of that here to understand what makes this the least bad solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9097.062s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So we're going to have to figure out with the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9099.843s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I know it is the role of the district to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9105.425s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Jerry, thank you for absorbing these comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9107.486s">[Reinfeld]</a>: You did the numbers, but that's not where<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9112.298s">[Reinfeld]</a>: You took the data that was given, but I feel like I just don't have any of that information about other than hearsay what people have sent me and knowing that this was sat down and said this was the possible course of action, and it wasn't feasible because of this, but this is feasible and I want to know that it really is I need to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9131.969s">[Reinfeld]</a>: that there's a plan, you can say this, this person is going away again I'm going to repeat myself because this is the same presentation, the work isn't going away and so who's going to be doing it right if you're cutting the person who's leading the effort to roll out our new health curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9147.288s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Where is that happening now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9148.568s">[Reinfeld]</a>: What will this look like in practice?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9151.109s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Because these are the numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9152.63s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I don't know that we have time to get into those nitty gritties, but I would really like to see some information, not just on numbers, but the on the ground numbers, the qualitative reasons that this is the least bad plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18616.156s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18620.157s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=232.632s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Ruseau, is there any history that we need to know about about how this has been done in the past other than inconsistently or in terms of timeline where the administration this year we got a packet full of policies slash draft policies with the final draft forthcoming?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=435.84s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=860.62s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Let's say it's about arrival and dismissal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=899.665s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So... Because if they have a concern about a school committee policy, that would be raised outside of this process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1263.8s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So would I be so on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1268.166s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I don't know how you wanna discuss this, but since we were just talking about this phase three, step three, sounds like we're talking about approval of handbooks as a whole once all of the discrepancies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1281.155s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So if there's an item that needs discussion in subcommittee, that handbook is not approved rather than everything approved except for this section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1291.182s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think that's a cleaner way to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1306.65s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I mean, I think it's just an added sentence around each handbook will be approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1314.012s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Actually, let me ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1314.872s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I assume we're approving handbooks one at a time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1317.893s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Can we approve one handbook at a time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1323.815s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Right, but to say, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1328.186s">[Reinfeld]</a>: approved by the school committee committee will be her handbook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1358.393s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Well, that was the question I asked on April 8th that sent us down a little spiral, and I just walked it back as it was late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1378.819s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We'll be in whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1402.822s">[Reinfeld]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1408.725s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is there ever a scenario when we send a handbook back to a school saying, fix this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1415.142s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Or is that a, you are invited to this subcommittee meeting to discuss this handbook?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1480.116s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I mean, it seems to me the main thing, the role that school committee has here, or possibly the superintendent, I guess this is my question at the end of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1494.123s">[Reinfeld]</a>: at the end of phase two here, this point three, the second part, or the first part of it, the school council will send the handbook and memorandum to the superintendent for review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1503.667s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Do we need to specify what that review entails?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1507.849s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I mean, I guess it's just sign off, but maybe it's the question about in one and two, because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1512.671s">[Reinfeld]</a>: The only time the handbook becomes a problem, and I've certainly received questions from parents about this, is if they perceive that an enforcement of a policy, which is kind of what the handbook lays out, is in conflict with the policy itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1526.899s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Who's doing that reconciliation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1529.26s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Presumably it's happening in one... Or is that just what needs to happen in that first review and then the memorandum of changes says,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1543.413s">[Reinfeld]</a>: we need to make sure that this section, I guess I think there are relevant sections of the handbook that relate to new policy, law, regulation, et cetera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1555.76s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And that's what the memorandum is meant to do is to say, we changed the, I had this, we changed the discipline to match the new bullying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1570.031s">[Reinfeld]</a>: policy, or when the out-of-school suspension, when the suspensions policy changed, to say we changed the discipline section of our handbook to comply with this, who checks it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1746.71s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But are we asking them to do that before they send it to us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1750.731s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I'm not asking them to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1867.001s">[Reinfeld]</a>: The memorandums, I think, is perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1869.623s">[Reinfeld]</a>: You need to know what's changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1871.865s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It's your track changes of the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1894.389s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Right, so I think one thing that we do need the superintendent's office to do unless this is us, but is to confirm consistency across elementary schools right if one elementary school makes a change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1909.018s">[Reinfeld]</a>: To something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1912.094s">[Reinfeld]</a>: that affects the other ones or the two middle schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1916.377s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Like I might've missed it, but one of them seems to have a homework policy and the other doesn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1922.08s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And that seems like a problem in equity for students that making expectations clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1928.304s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I might just have missed it in this as I flipped through this large binder that we got.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1947.556s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Because I do think, if you get a memorandum that says you need to change this to comply with that policy and one school changes it in one way and another changes it in a different way, or is this first memorandum saying, no, no, this needs to change in this specific way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1967.708s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I mean, I think- We're to say that all handbooks have the, you know, I think there's an important, there's a useful conversation to have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1974.331s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We don't have to have it this year about should each elementary school have, should there be a Medford Elementary Schools expectations and then school-specific procedures?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1985.317s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Should there be one elementary school handbook with an addendum for the Roberts, for the Missittuck, for the McGlynn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1993.862s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But I do think there's some consistency that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1998.567s">[Reinfeld]</a>: needs to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2033.228s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2033.808s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I mean, those are the three things I think we hear about consistency on levels, consistency across schools, consistency between school protocol and official policy, and then consistency between what parents are told verbally in the moment and what's written down in one or another location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2056.411s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So this process can't address all of that, but it can address the consistency across schools with alignment with official policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2141.137s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I just wanted to double check that there were tables of contents and everything, which there aren't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2147.922s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Can we mandate any parts of handbooks that every handbook must have this section or?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2155.527s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But I don't know if that's part of this policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2206.488s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Well, I do know people are looking and saying, look, this says right here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2214.331s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Absolutely at the end, but I don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2218.905s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It's interesting, because some of these have federal laws included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2221.748s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Some of these say, we've included the policies we think are most relevant to elementary school students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2229.316s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think nobody says, here, go to this website, which who would want to, knowing that website where our policies live?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2307.18s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Well, and the one that they gave us has a bunch of yellow highlighting that says, this is changing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2310.883s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2361.725s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I mean, I will say when it comes time for me to review, I like having it in hard copy, but.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2387.951s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, but is that, and then I guess in phase three here, we haven't said, so it says the school committee will receive copies and we will approve it, amend it or discuss further.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2404.537s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Does that mean everyone is reading every handbook?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2425.58s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So is maybe is so is that I guess is that a separate question in terms of onboarding new members is you should have the handbook so you know what's happening in the schools on paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2625.737s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Sorry, I didn't mean to take us quite so far off topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2629.519s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So in terms of this policy, I think the staging is good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2634.201s">[Reinfeld]</a>: The dates seem reasonable to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2636.422s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm sure the people carrying out phases one and two have opinions on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2721.215s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think, I mean, I only know about the Roberts because Mia said, Oh, yes, I'm on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2729.046s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2729.908s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Sorry, former member of stone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2779.489s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Do we need to say in phase 1.1 the superintendent or their designee<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2791.67s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Was there a designee within central administration?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2795.454s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I mean, I think it needs to be clear that they're not designating it to... Yeah, so it always is or designee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2812.441s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, so that is implied kind of across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2815.303s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Cause I know we've had things saying, well, we didn't mean that you should do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2818.585s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We meant that your office should do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2820.646s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2911.132s">[Reinfeld]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2911.972s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Can you just put this up on the screen so I can read everything, I think?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2919.176s">[Reinfeld]</a>: There we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2919.976s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It was, yep, that's great for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2922.777s">[Reinfeld]</a>: No, I don't need the, that magnification that you had before was great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2928.16s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Oh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2929.788s">[Reinfeld]</a>: 125.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2929.828s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I just needed it scrolled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2932.95s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yep, I can see the end of three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2936.111s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I don't need to see the policy information section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2960.823s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, mandatory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3029.724s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Because I'm right in thinking that, because the handbooks have to be final and approved for students to receive at the end of August when school starts, because I know they sign off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3047.373s">[Reinfeld]</a>: May has been terrible and with our very wise decision to push, bring the budgeting process forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3057.466s">[Reinfeld]</a>: it just may, it compounds may.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3060.787s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But I'm not saying push budgeting back because knowing all this early is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3065.429s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is there a disconnect?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3068.071s">[Reinfeld]</a>: This is my pedantry on display here, that the digital versions being created in phase 1.1<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3077.802s">[Reinfeld]</a>: is what becomes the draft digital handbooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3101.704s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I mean, what you're asking is for the superintendent to duplicate the current year's handbook and update that to create the upcoming year draft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3119.79s">[Reinfeld]</a>: The upcoming school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3175.886s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, if the superintendent notices an inconsistency and makes an update, do then they need to have, is there a third memorandum?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3187.034s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I don't want this many memorandums, but do we need to know that the superintendent updated the Brooks handbook to match the Roberts handbook?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3207.563s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Or do they do the superintendent have to go back to the school council and say hi for consistency reasons I'm making this change I.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3257.76s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Provide the memorandum to whom?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3260.02s">[Reinfeld]</a>: To school committee and the school council, or?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3265.602s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3285.39s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yep, sounds good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3286.131s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Just remove the provide before create on the second line of number four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3297.181s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Backseat typing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3306.509s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Mandatory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3313.098s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I would call these mandatory changes, but that'll just confuse things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3318.403s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Do we then, we're in subcommittee, do we motion to send this to full committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3323.789s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Passing it by the administration first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3397.679s">[Reinfeld]</a>: What comes after the word?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3398.999s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I can figure out words in context, but I don't have enough of it for this one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3437.742s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Getting administrative, getting the approval from the administration and or principals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3537.696s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3554.389s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is that part of this conversation for this meeting or is that the follow-on motion once this is reported out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3568.851s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3576.478s">[Reinfeld]</a>: No, but I mean, do we need, do we just need to approve these as is once we get the?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3634.765s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Because the current policy is we don't have a policy, just they have to be approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3640.028s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3640.469s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Until this policy goes into effect, we are not breaking our own policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3658.237s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is it too late to amend this policy to say this policy will be effective as of August 1st, 2024?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3684.496s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, I thought our rule said it's effective immediately unless indicated otherwise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3689.138s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I swear I read that somewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3694.94s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I've got the page open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3697.121s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3697.581s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I know I'm dragging this out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3698.961s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And no, that's not it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3706.484s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Governance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3709.365s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I wish this tab could move.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3754.072s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm taking your word on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3829.741s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think my only question is, when we bring this to the floor, do we need to talk about this year's handbooks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3847.774s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Or I guess maybe I'm asking if it needs to get added to the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3887.096s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Alright, so, but that's not a motion of this subcommittee that we review handbooks for approval by the end of the school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3902.23s">[Reinfeld]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3903.171s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Well, then I guess we didn't have that conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3922.148s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3922.489s">[Reinfeld]</a>: No, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3926.394s">[Reinfeld]</a>: member motion second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3932.023s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3069.185s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Hi, hello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3069.965s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I just have a couple of questions regarding the proposed budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3073.127s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So on slide 15, there's two positions being proposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3078.85s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It says payroll slash HR new positions, capacity and supervision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3082.932s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So with the current proposed budget cuts, could you just elaborate on what these two positions being added with considering they cost roughly $150,000 annually?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3300.752s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then I just had another question on slide 19 for the proposed general ed class size from schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3308.724s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, for 2025 for the Brooks it'd be up to 19.9.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3313.505s">[Reinfeld]</a>: The McGlynn 22.2, Mr. Tuck 22, and then the Roberts 20.5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3316.927s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Do you have any data about the possible negatives of increasing classroom sizes to that size as that could potentially put a lot of strain on teachers and educators in classrooms?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3483.046s">[Reinfeld]</a>: All right, I'll start with what I like, which is I like the transparency and the clarity here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3488.147s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So thank you again for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3490.327s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I really like that this reflects the past year of spending.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3492.988s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So that's incredibly helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3497.149s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And that moves into my first question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3498.889s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm just gonna go in numerical order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3501.85s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Slide seven, this didn't appear on the slide, but you mentioned that there was 500K for undistributed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3507.951s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Was that used for its intended purpose last year or did that end up being flexed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3569.134s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3570.255s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Slide 14, you mentioned new technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3573.137s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is this coming with added security concerns or costs to maintain safety, privacy, all of that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3618.47s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But that's one of the positions that is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3620.905s">[Reinfeld]</a>: potentially?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3651.628s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Right, but there's a director position as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3666.246s">[Reinfeld]</a>: All right, I'm always gonna have this question on slide 15.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3669.747s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I see a lot of contract services listed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3672.849s">[Reinfeld]</a>: What assurances can you give me that contracting these things out is more cost efficient than doing it in-house?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3686.694s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3693.357s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3724.4s">[Reinfeld]</a>: All right, on this same slide, you mentioned the supply budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3727.282s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is that going to reduce the, I'll call it an unspoken burden on individual staff members for supplies?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3740.173s">[Reinfeld]</a>: In terms of, are those for individual classrooms, or are they for school-wide?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3776.209s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm glad that we are providing more of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3782.085s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Graham already asked about class sizes and offerings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3787.306s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I would love some more information on the McGlynn position, the consolidation of the administrative position there, given that those are two schools and each of the other schools has its own administrative assistant and also given the particular vulnerabilities in that school's population.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3865.805s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm sure we'll hear about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3867.486s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3868.046s">[Reinfeld]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3870.067s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then my, my very last question was actually building a little bit on member Graham's question about the DPH minimums.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=3876.609s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We, my questions were, when are they, where are we and how do our health needs and this, the health needs question might be for some of the people out here compared to other districts with their ratios.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=4041.101s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you, I understand that, and I will have questions for the administration at later dates about what the plan, if these changes are accepted, what the plan is, because just because you take people away, the work doesn't go away either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5868.483s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I just wanted to ask a follow-up question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5871.024s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm not sure, I may have missed it in Member Bransley's questions, but if the secretary positions are being cut at the McGlynn and other schools,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5884.751s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I just wanted to ask a question if, because I'm not sure, it may have been clarified already, if APs were on the, being considered for being cut, because if the workload is being put onto the secretaries, I may be mistaken, but for the McGlynn, it's roughly, for the elementary school alone, it's 500 students per one secretary, and at the high school, based on the cuts proposed, it's gonna be 600 students per secretary, so if AP,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5912.256s">[Reinfeld]</a>: AP assistant principals are cut in the future, then who's going to do the workload?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5917.485s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Because the workload from the secretary is going to go down to the AP unit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5920.57s">[Reinfeld]</a>: If that works, someone's got to do the work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=9000.985s">[Reinfeld]</a>: hear from I just so I'm encouraged by the long-term prospects I want us to not be in this situation next year or any year after and then as we open this up to public comment I this you know this is what not just underfunded but deprioritized education looks like to be in this situation and so this year is terrible we are in a position where<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=9024.574s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We're not going to find good solutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=9026.995s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We're going to find the least bad solutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=9029.435s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So please work with us to help us figure out what we can do to not cause irreparable damage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13015.384s">[Reinfeld]</a>: from speaking with teachers, they've told us that it is an open-door policy, and we've also been working with Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13021.827s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Cabral to get in the new handbook provisions to explicitly state that Medford High School is an open-door policy to allow for school committee members to visit the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13240.362s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I just wonder if I could present a letter on behalf of the Student Advisory Committee drafted to the school board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13258.925s">[Reinfeld]</a>: On behalf of the students of Mefford High School, we the students of the Student Advisory Committee, expressing a consensus opinion of the committee for the school year of 2023 to 2024, are writing this letter to express our opinion on the planned budget cuts to the Mefford Public Schools positions and budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13274.939s">[Reinfeld]</a>: The Mefford Student Advisory Committee acknowledges that the city of Mefford is presently experiencing a budget deficit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13279.684s">[Reinfeld]</a>: This deficit has put a great strain on city services provided to the citizens of Mefford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13283.755s">[Reinfeld]</a>: One place where these budget constraints are already felt is in the Medford Public School Districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13289.0s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Some of the major issues the Student Advisory Committee would like to highlight to the Medford School Committee include the lack of running water in the teacher's break room, a lack of heating and cooling in classrooms during the summer and winter respectively, as well as asbestos remaining inside of the facilities in Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13305.953s">[Reinfeld]</a>: The school committee has proposed the budget cuts to the 2024-2025 school year budget of the Medford Public School Districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13312.015s">[Reinfeld]</a>: These cuts, if carried out, will have an immediate and long-term detrimental effects on the quality of educations for the students in the Medford Public School District.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13320.498s">[Reinfeld]</a>: As a result of these budget cuts proposed in the fine arts positions, as well as numerous other positions, student activities that are essential to the school and culture of Medford High School, as well as the community of Medford as a whole, will be put at risk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13335.794s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Furthermore, this will lead to a drop in education quality and opportunities for students, which could lead to a decrease in the number of students attending Mefford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13344.396s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Furthermore, these proposed cuts will raise the workload of Mefford Public Schools faculties, further increasing the already large burden on Mefford Public School faculty members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13354.279s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Additionally, the proposed 2025 proposal would increase the average class size across the board from nearly 20 pupils per class, with McGlynn and Missitook pushing a proposed average of 22 students per class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13366.018s">[Reinfeld]</a>: The Student Advisory Committee believes that when it comes to student education, there should be no compromises.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13371.022s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Students deserve the right to receive the highest quality of education possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13374.964s">[Reinfeld]</a>: While the deficit does pose a considerable concern, the Student Advisory Committee would also like to point out that these proposed cuts are affecting teachers and lower echelon administrative staff who do most of the day-to-day paperwork and operations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13388.534s">[Reinfeld]</a>: While the School Committee does not have the authority to make the budget,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13391.957s">[Reinfeld]</a>: They can request that the City Council propose a new budget to account for the needs of students and teachers in the Medford Public School District.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13397.819s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Students deserve a quality environment with well-paid teachers and faculty and a safe, operable facility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13403.662s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And before I end off, I would just like to add a personal opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13407.29s">[Reinfeld]</a>: As a lifelong student of Medford Public Schools, a student representative for the Student Advisory Committee, as well as a student government official, and someone who has performed in the fine arts, I can say without doubt that these cuts will result in an immediate and long-term, long-lasting negative impact for students for generations to come if these cuts are made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13425.59s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=790.178s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=792.64s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I had a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=793.921s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm so sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=799.507s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Don't say that out loud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=802.714s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So last week we heard comments about roof replacement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=806.156s">[Reinfeld]</a>: This isn't gonna mess with that, or this won't get uprooted immediately with- No, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=818.423s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But this won't get in the way of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=1333.872s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to adjourn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=132.234s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to go to executive session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5886.573s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, I just I just wanted to say that I would like to see the default to be to consider the non fossil fuel solutions for our building projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5898.4s">[Reinfeld]</a>: which I think is a reverse of kind of historically what we as a society has done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5902.663s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm, and I think provision three here in particular is about bringing these decisions to the school committee so we can evaluate the language in terms of the climate goals that we have for the city the sustainability goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5917.491s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And, and not just the financial goals looking being able to look comprehensively at upfront costs and then sustained maintenance costs, and I think that's really important that we're not just making the decisions based on what it costs right now to do this, but also to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5934.483s">[Reinfeld]</a>: maintain these systems and make them sustainable for the future, because we know a lot of our buildings are about to experience some major stresses with age.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5944.831s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And this right here right now is the time to be planning for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9411.026s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I had two questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9413.368s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So to confirm, we're looking at this coming out of the city budget rather than the school's budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9421.593s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Just wanted to say it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9424.116s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Then my question, Dr. Cushing, you alluded to this, what does compatibility look like for future projects in terms of what equipment we're going to need and being able to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9436.559s">[Reinfeld]</a>: make the connection move transition into the next stage of renovating this what is more, and I guess maybe I'm asking what is Moore's law for HVAC equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9453.448s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Because, in all honesty, provided the transition I was expecting them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9456.67s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9490.494s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I would love that, sir.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9685.671s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, and then will the, do you anticipate, I know nobody can see the future exactly, but do you anticipate there will be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9694.255s">[Reinfeld]</a>: more climate friendly, more low carbon options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9698.662s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And that's kind of what I want to anticipate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9701.285s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I don't want to be in a cycle of replacing things with what we have, just because it's the only thing available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=10262.697s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=10267.423s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=11802.305s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Or member, I'm sorry, this is just to approve the pool<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=11812.349s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I have some questions about the athletics and theater, but that's still under discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=11816.351s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So we'll see that at another point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=11820.813s">[Reinfeld]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=11821.413s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I'll motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=11823.274s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Motion for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=11824.254s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Pool and facilities rates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12849.899s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Would you like to speak, Member Reinfeld?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12851.974s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm happy to answer questions, but it's late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12854.295s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Basically, we've had a lot of new curricula come on in the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12858.876s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We have a pretty robust process for introducing the curricula and also our top goal or the number one on our strategic plan is to develop this cycle, so I'd like to get that process moving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=104.714s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I believe member Graham is also in transit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=131.383s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3479.178s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I have a question about how things get recorded if someone abstains a vote, because we have it listed as 7-0, but it was 6-0 and one abstention on last week's meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3561.15s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, I am.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3567.253s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4353.248s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, but thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4476.269s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, and thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5891.981s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5893.578s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yep, thank you, Dr. Galussi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5895.919s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I have a couple of clarification questions, which is to note, so the table of substitute coverage, this school year, these numbers are over eight months, whereas the previous year is over 10 months, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5909.786s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5910.726s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5911.987s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But the number is still higher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5913.728s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Was school year 2022-23 particularly high in absence, or are we...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5922.283s">[Reinfeld]</a>: or was this year particularly low?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5924.885s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Without more context on either side, I can't quite tell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5983.805s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I'm just trying to figure out how we can project ahead as to what the need is going to be and what's typical here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5989.091s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Are things actively going down because the needs are changing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=5997.096s">[Reinfeld]</a>: or not?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6011.161s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Great, so and then one little question, do long term subs attend planning periods and team school grade level planning?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6019.684s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is that part of the long term sub responsibility?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6040.565s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, and then I just wanted to confirm, I think you introduced some information that may have shifted my numbers, but it looks<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6050.279s">[Reinfeld]</a>: we're spending 50 to 60% of the spending on substitutes is in-house, but in-house folks are covering about 86% of the need here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6060.182s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So if we are shifting away from in-house coverage, we're going to see that percentage change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6066.525s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Although I do want to say, especially noting that there are a lot of teachers here, thank you for this coverage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6071.126s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It is much appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6142.34s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I definitely want to second what Member Branley said about understanding where the, what coverage, where the services are being sacrificed in these situations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6153.573s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6154.513s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then I also wanted to ask, you mentioned a few of the things that the staffing company would do in terms of onboarding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6161.474s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I always have this question when we bring in consultants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6163.795s">[Reinfeld]</a>: What is the added value of paying a staffing company to do this work versus things that we've thought of in-house, such as just raising the rates of pay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6171.816s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Why are we bringing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6173.677s">[Reinfeld]</a>: What else would the company add that would make that better?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6249.848s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Does that make sense?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6254.29s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That makes sense, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6255.291s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm just trying to understand where that money is gonna go to hire someone outside versus to the people doing the substituting, doing the coverages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6802.226s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Oh yeah, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6804.827s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I just in regards to point number two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6806.667s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Our policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6808.328s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I see I see a, uh, lists this as although as awareness day, so I think that's a pretty easy motion to amend that policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6816.831s">[Reinfeld]</a>: The question of putting it on calendars is a little different because we have the public calendar that is the closures and then there was a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6828.796s">[Reinfeld]</a>: that we recognize Awareness Acceptance Advocacy Month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6832.52s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And so I'm wondering if that is part of, in terms of distribution to the public, is part of the longer conversation about the calendar and how it's published.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6842.608s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But absolutely, I think we should amend the policy as it currently exists, that line there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6848.861s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then my question on number three, I wondered if it would make sense, although possibly not with the suggestion just approved, for the subcommittee to sit down with CPAC, the Medford Family Network's autism<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6865.459s">[Reinfeld]</a>: spectrum parent support group and then the conversation around procedural safeguards and FERPA and all of those screening things and then prepare something that the full committee might be able to approve with a concrete step for the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6883.111s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I wonder if that information gathering might be well suited for subcommittee with members of the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7162.134s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7163.015s">[Reinfeld]</a>: You could potentially share the agenda on screen and not read it all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8930.379s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, so in the initial approval to set up this committee, we had identified various subcommittees, such as communication and community engagement, sustainability, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, finance, and then others as needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8944.95s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Does this composition<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8947.051s">[Reinfeld]</a>: have the ability to form those subcommittees along with the non-voting members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8951.552s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I see you nodding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8952.352s">[Reinfeld]</a>: The other question is, looking at the broad range of expertise that we got, this committee was also designed to, I've been pushing very hard for advisory committees throughout the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8964.414s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Are there particular advisory committees that you anticipate needing based on applications who were unable to be seated as voting members or general expertise that we need?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9058.319s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9059.94s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm looking forward to receiving the initial report so we can confirm that those things are moving and are as inclusive as we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9067.482s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9069.402s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I will now defer to Mr. Guillen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9514.425s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Can I motion to approve the community members?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9518.367s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It sounds like we feel comfortable moving forward with that vote now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9718.715s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Or from like alternating for the non-voting member Rousseau, or?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9907.54s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I thought Member Ruseau had done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9910.382s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Roll call, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9921.269s">[Reinfeld]</a>: To be represented and voted on at the next meeting as to who they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9930.619s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9997.426s">[Reinfeld]</a>: There's a question about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9999.867s">[Reinfeld]</a>: The ad hoc committee, when created, was about developing the process for review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10003.927s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I was told it wasn't about doing the actual review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10010.277s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Sorry, I just got a zoom error message.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10012.657s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I want to confirm that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10014.018s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is this ad hoc committee doing the review as well?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10016.358s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Because I am concerned about my time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10019.719s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I will say that is my bias on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10038.607s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And just to report that we because this committee changed, we do not have the final process in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10046.293s">[Reinfeld]</a>: For the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10200.46s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Follow up on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10201.481s">[Reinfeld]</a>: You said every school is required by whom?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10203.764s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is that a school committee rule?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10205.225s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is that a state rule?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10253.118s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So it's- I guess I'm looking at it from this side for the first time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10259.062s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I was curious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10260.784s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10358.378s">[Reinfeld]</a>: What are we approving that they'll be presented at the next meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10367.075s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And we're sending comments, feedback, further requests to you, Dr. Edward-Vince.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10377.702s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm unmuted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10378.262s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10379.783s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=138.08s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And if he can't, my wife has been involved with this group, so I can speak to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=142.682s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I spoke with Ellery as well, but I'd love to hear where the district is coming from on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=147.724s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But it is a three question survey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=149.805s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I can pull it up, actually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=157.089s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I had reached out to the Safe Routes to Schools people to say, hey, is there anything you'd want us to keep in mind?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=163.574s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And they said, oh, actually, this thing that has been kind of chugging along slowly is set to launch tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=169.219s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So it was, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=171.641s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=174.025s">[Reinfeld]</a>: The survey itself is run by Safe Routes to Schools, which is a statewide group that does local advocacy and assessments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=183.351s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And it is a very basic survey, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=187.313s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So if you click on where you live, whoops, and then you answer questions about your child.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=197.919s">[Reinfeld]</a>: How do you get to school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=198.94s">[Reinfeld]</a>: How do you get from school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=200.901s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And this is it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=203.174s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So it's not comprehensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=204.635s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I know this group is interested in getting more data about what stops people from active transportation, walking, biking, rolling this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=216.201s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But this survey is just this assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=218.483s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I believe it goes to the state organization of Safe Routes to Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=224.146s">[Reinfeld]</a>: They do the data and provide a report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=232.748s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I have the report from the Roberts from 2018.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=234.95s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It used to be done by school, and I think they're pretty excited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=239.454s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Hi, Kitty, about having a comprehensive approach from the district on this, but it's really focusing on alternative transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=478.114s">[Reinfeld]</a>: question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=478.314s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think I'm right, though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=479.254s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes one meta question I have is whether we're looking to have an assessment and understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=485.656s">[Reinfeld]</a>: The what are the obstacles to participating in district provided transportation or alternative methods versus what could the district do differently?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=495.078s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That would shift your transportation behavior because those are kind of two different approaches to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1366.447s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1368.708s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I will note that Member Ruseau and several other members sat in on the Student Advisory Committee or Student Advisory Council meeting last week, and they raised some challenges with the busing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1381.652s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Some of it was around how it is implemented at the schools in terms of stopping points and lines and crowding, and some of it was around timing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1390.336s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Was this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1394.127s">[Reinfeld]</a>: The high school high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1396.329s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, so I would echo what member Ruseau said earlier that getting student feedback certainly at the high school level and I think the middle school level as well I think my question is, to what extent is this survey about the quality of the experiences of the services being provided versus the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1415.896s">[Reinfeld]</a>: the, the, which services should be provided and are going to be used because, you know, the things that we keep hearing about, about overcrowding on the buses or lack of bus monitor or vaping on the middle school bus, those sorts of questions, as you say, distinguishing fact from fiction, how prevalent are these issues?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1434.448s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I saw Megan's hand go up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1484.648s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I mean- I think my question there is to, is it, can we phrase those things in terms of obstacles?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1494.949s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Are people not putting their kids on the bus because of X, Y, or Z reasons?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1501.39s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I think that phrasing is useful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1721.877s">[Reinfeld]</a>: May I share a map of our school radiuses?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1726.18s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1727.021s">[Reinfeld]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1730.563s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So these are our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1734.226s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, my toolbar's in the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1735.947s">[Reinfeld]</a>: There it goes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1737.228s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1737.568s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And so this is within half a mile.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1740.69s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then the lighter shading is one mile.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1746.007s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then these dotted lines are the three miles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1749.031s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So, particularly when we're looking right Fulton Heights I know we do a bus at the high school here, but we've also got a lot of outside the radius for the high school and a lot of these neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1762.126s">[Reinfeld]</a>: are a particular demographic and so there's a there's a huge equity issue and understanding I love Megan's idea of reaching out specifically to families right the elementary schools have this have these radii but even some of that is not being<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1778.618s">[Reinfeld]</a>: captured in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1780.34s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then there's also, I think, the stigma issue that needs to be talked about, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1785.886s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Riding a bus, the kids who are able to park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1789.55s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is parking free for high school students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1792.353s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1793.208s">[Reinfeld]</a>: OK, but that, of course, requires owning a car or having access to a car.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1798.874s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And so I don't know to what extent stigma is informing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1802.517s">[Reinfeld]</a>: You know, we can ask about how would your behavior change if we made these changes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1807.782s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But some of it is not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1809.584s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Some of it is really rooted in, you know what, even if you give me these buses, I wouldn't take them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1816.204s">[Reinfeld]</a>: or even if I knew how to walk to school, I wouldn't, or my family, my parent drives past the school every day, and so they drop me off, and I'm never gonna switch to something else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1828.607s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So what we're hoping to accomplish, is there an ideal situation that we want to achieve here, or is it just, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1933.94s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And that- And that was, that was actually their complaint that there are two buses and they're crowded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2842.731s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, so they raised five concerns, and I just need to find that tab that has it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2848.935s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So there are five concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2851.697s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Where did it go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2852.578s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Wait, nope, that's your document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2854.039s">[Reinfeld]</a>: This one's my document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2855.78s">[Reinfeld]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2857.641s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2858.262s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Oh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2868.956s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, it was the student safety in the bus lines, the setting designated arrival and departure position positions to reduce crowding more buses for North Medford and other underserved areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2884.17s">[Reinfeld]</a>: five and 10 minutes, and it wasn't consistent as to when the arrival time was, and it wasn't time to accommodate people staying late, so that's your late bus question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2893.193s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then the 95, either comes very early, very late, the early bus is very crowded, the late bus doesn't get people to their jobs on time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2902.716s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Ruseau, did I miss anything?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2920.527s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Well, I think a potential setup is just the baseline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2924.789s">[Reinfeld]</a>: What do you do now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2927.289s">[Reinfeld]</a>: What would you like to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2929.91s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Or do we have questions about getting fewer people taking buses, more bike pool, more walk pools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2938.553s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But what do you do now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2941.502s">[Reinfeld]</a>: What would you do if the options were there for you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2945.263s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And what are the obstacles to getting to those ideals, whether it's walking, biking, buses, carpools, parking?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2958.628s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think that is how this is shaking out for me in assessing what you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2965.948s">[Reinfeld]</a>: What would you anticipate doing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2967.91s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I want to recognize Megan's point that there's some education around that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2972.033s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think we could absolutely aim to have fewer cars in the school drop-offs and pickup lines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2978.338s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That's going to be some education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2979.759s">[Reinfeld]</a>: There's going to be some resistance in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2982.141s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But understanding what the barriers are for walking, biking, carpools, busing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2990.008s">[Reinfeld]</a>: is important, so where you're going, and that's specifically what the obstacles are, or as I asked in the beginning of the call, what could we do to facilitate your ideal situation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=2999.631s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But I think obstacles is probably the way to go on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3004.653s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That's what people are experiencing, is they're saying, oh, I'm not doing this because X, Y, or Z. Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3101.838s">[Reinfeld]</a>: For whatever it's worth, the city, I spoke to Todd Blake, city engineer, and they're saying they're in the process of mapping the school addresses of students who take the bus and kind of looking at which roads are getting the traffic and what kind of shape they're in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3120.026s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So there's some coordination with the city once we have these results as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3126.169s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But they're interested in understanding that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3130.054s">[Reinfeld]</a>: especially since I will note that a lot of these neighborhoods have changed since I imagine the last time we did any kind of transportation assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3425.414s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm noting Megan's comment in the chat here about asking families to sign up for the bus in May this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3430.958s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Does that mean there's content you'd like to have ready with that sign up to say, you're not asking for a preliminary survey response or we shouldn't try to push things to meet that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3441.886s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3446.509s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Because if this is the moment when everyone's ready to talk about their transportation needs, I don't want to miss an opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3510.035s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Graham, do you know if this kind of assessment for a new high school, would this be a separate effort to understand the needs there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=3550.836s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Because I know building and grounds are separate, separate entities for people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=220.526s">[Reinfeld]</a>: All right, I guess we'll go in the order that you called us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=224.088s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So hi everyone, I'm Erika Reinfeld.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=227.029s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I am talking to you right now from MIT.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=230.471s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I teach science communication here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=232.312s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I've worked in a lot of museums.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=233.433s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I have background in astronomy and theater and museum education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=237.615s">[Reinfeld]</a>: all of the disciplines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=238.696s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I am interested in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=240.377s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm also a Medford mom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=241.897s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I have a seventh grader and a third grader, and I am very excited about having all of these voices in our conversations about what our schools are going to look like in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=253.523s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So thank you for taking up time after school to be a part of this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=257.806s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It is amazingly appreciated by us on the committee and also by your fellow students and teachers and administrators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=264.809s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=324.198s">[Reinfeld]</a>: All right, well, let me, can you hear me before I go on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=329.241s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Can you hear me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=332.423s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That's a yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=333.965s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Excellent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=334.686s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, hello there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=335.786s">[Reinfeld]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=336.247s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So again, I am Erica Reinfeld.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=338.908s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I am talking to you from MIT today where I teach science communication, but I have also worked in museums for the Smithsonian and for MIT's Cancer Research Center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=349.876s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I have a background in astronomy and theater and museum education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=352.778s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I am about all of the things that you study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=355.419s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I am<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=356.48s">[Reinfeld]</a>: so excited about the curriculum components, and I am so grateful to all of you for volunteering your time to be on a part of the school committee in a student advisory capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=367.087s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm also a Medford mom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=368.448s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I have a seventh grader and a third grader, and I just really appreciate this, and I know your classmates, your teachers, the rest of the committee does as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=869.585s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I think the other part that needs to be a part of the conversation is understanding some of the motivation for why the policy exists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=876.308s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Cause I've, I've heard certainly some concerns around, you know, is this, are we just talking about backpacks, but what about large totes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=882.752s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And there are some equity issues where some student populations are more likely to carry a large tote and some are more likely to carry backpacks and are those being treated the same way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=891.856s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But is this about the devices that can distract people in class?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=895.918s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And so this is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=897.699s">[Reinfeld]</a>: an opportunity to not have those devices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=900.621s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And so how can we make sure that a new policy solves the problems that the initial policy was intended to have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=907.546s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I think that's the other component.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=909.787s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We see the burden that the policy can place on students, but then taking that away, what are the consequences of that for being in class, for being between classes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=922.213s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think there are different concerns during passing than there are in class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=925.955s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So just making sure that conversation includes not just the impact on students, but on the entire class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=1106.55s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, sounds like you all have a fairly good idea of the issues and the reasons that we want this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=1110.571s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I wonder if rather than doing another survey, you might think about once we, you have a proposal for what this would look like, asking people to respond to that specific proposal rather than having another open-ended feedback that comes in, but make it more of a feedback than an input response situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=1131.359s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'd say here's what we think would solve the problems we know about, what have we forgotten?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=1368.222s">[Reinfeld]</a>: If this is the if this is the same Google Doc that was shared in the last meeting, I believe I have that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=1390.466s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Sorry, am I sharing the one that that we had last time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=1395.036s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=1399.64s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Close that window.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2202.205s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2202.686s">[Reinfeld]</a>: This was very thoughtful, very well researched, and I appreciate what's gone into this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2208.871s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Can I ask, have you spoken to any of the school, the faculty, teachers about the alignment, any of your advisors about the alignment with their, with learning goals and course goals?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2444.696s">[Reinfeld]</a>: What would you most like to get from the school committee members who are in the room right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2449.46s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm aware of the time and that there are more things on the agenda and obviously as an educator I have a lot of thoughts on how this all plays out and I don't think this is the moment to go into depth in every point because there's a lot to be discussed and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2463.484s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Um, hashed out, but you know, is this something that we would want to schedule a subcommittee meeting with the curriculum?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2470.766s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Subcommittee and instruction to, to talk about this with teachers and students in the room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2476.548s">[Reinfeld]</a>: What would be most useful at this point with limited time for, in terms of either in this meeting or next steps that you would like to see?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2519.764s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2520.064s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That's really helpful because I think school committee can set policies and obviously that does take some time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2525.309s">[Reinfeld]</a>: There's a limit to, especially with open meetings, of how fast a fast track is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2531.414s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But also there's the stipulation that the implementation falls to the schools themselves and we can't tell teachers how to teach, but we can set some of those parameters, whether it's about the homework, about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2545.376s">[Reinfeld]</a>: the expectations per syllabus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2546.956s">[Reinfeld]</a>: A lot of this seems to be about laying out what are the expectations and knowing what's coming over the course of a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2553.558s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But thank you, that's really helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2555.659s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I see how urgent this is on many levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3245.586s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I have one question and one comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3247.948s">[Reinfeld]</a>: One question is, are these conditions exacerbated during inclement weather?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3252.392s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I ask because I personally am a most seasons biker, and so I'm curious about alternative transportation in terms of biking as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3263.441s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Are there more people riding buses?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3267.204s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Does the weather affect these issues?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3281.402s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That's good to hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3282.383s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then the other, the comment that I wanted to make is that this is really good timing to have this meeting because we have a strategic planning subcommittee meeting scheduled for Monday about a district-wide transportation survey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3295.072s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And so if there are particular questions that you think we ought to be asking more broadly in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3300.055s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I would certainly love to receive those from you in anticipation of this meeting on Monday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3308.458s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3309.579s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And that can happen over email.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3311.84s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm not trying to put anyone on the spot, especially at 331.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3446.141s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, it was protected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3447.302s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I was in that meeting that that those protected bike lanes went away because a lot of people spoke out against having bike lanes on Winthrop Street and the compromise was that the bike lanes not be protected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3456.674s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And that was because people showed up and fought against protected bike lanes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3460.779s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So if this is important, please do continue to show up at meetings to advocate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3641.115s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you for the work in putting it together and for presenting it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3644.996s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm gonna ask again, so what are you hoping to get from this group at this time in regards to this document?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3824.97s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I asked member Ruseau and Mr. Dalton what kind of protocols need to happen for something like this to be reviewed and put up as an official.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3834.578s">[Reinfeld]</a>: This is my new member hat going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3838.362s">[Reinfeld]</a>: How would this work?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3913.005s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4652.494s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I just wanted to know if this is the first, when, is this the first time these awards have been offered?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=4660.717s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Are these inaugural or are they continuing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5929.875s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think we have a motion on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5931.776s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Didn't we have a motion to request?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5934.878s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I don't think we voted on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=5936.399s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think, I think we did take a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9535.301s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you, Member Ruseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9536.222s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9537.083s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yep, I had two questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9540.046s">[Reinfeld]</a>: One, and I know this was in the old policy as well, what if the Secretary is a new member?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9545.772s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is that, I mean, a new member can't, and the Secretary's elected<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9553.103s">[Reinfeld]</a>: during that first meeting, at which point the duties have started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9555.385s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I'm a little confused about the logistics, but I know this has stood as is for quite a while, so I don't know what to do about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9563.591s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then my second question is, there was a phrase removed about non-discrimination, that there's membership on a school committee is not limited to race, color, sex, religion, national origin, or sexual orientation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9576.442s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Ruseau?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9637.626s">[Reinfeld]</a>: This is covered by the non-discrimination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10107.116s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So some of this used to exist, and then when we moved to Zoom, that became the only online access that was announced in meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10114.023s">[Reinfeld]</a>: This is just to say when people go to look at the minutes, they should be able to get to the videos quite easily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10120.289s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I realize that it can be difficult to post the individual video links.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10124.874s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I did talk to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10127.608s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Tom about whether or not this would be possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10129.85s">[Reinfeld]</a>: He said it would be fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10131.291s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But in the absence of that, I would be completely fine with just the link to find previous recordings here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10137.896s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It was suggested that there might be some policy changes required on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10143.02s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I went and I looked at the policies, and they really just describe what's in the minutes and what's in the announcements about time and place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10150.426s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It doesn't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10152.242s">[Reinfeld]</a>: need to be, doesn't seem to be needing an amendment on the videos.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10156.423s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I have that language if we need to add them, but it kind of changes the name of the resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10160.624s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I'm happy for questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10162.205s">[Reinfeld]</a>: This is just about making these things available to the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10167.166s">[Reinfeld]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10194.54s">[Reinfeld]</a>: To post, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10196.382s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So we have the agenda and then we have...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10199.98s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then we have the minutes are posted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10202.022s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Once the minutes are approved, the minutes go up and it would be easy enough to just add that Zoom link or so I'm told.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10208.707s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I would be perfectly happy with just a here's where to go and find it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10352.7s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And that's one part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10353.4s">[Reinfeld]</a>: The other part was about letting people know where they can watch it on cable and through live streams, which, as I said, used to be the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10363.182s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And as somebody who would often tune in and listen to these meetings while I'm dealing with dinner or children, it was helpful to have those links with the meeting info.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10389.608s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, I think you can just strike and that individual recording links through the end of that sentence there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10397.631s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Just archives recordings of Medford Public School Committee meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10442.603s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10466.202s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Because these are the education channels and there's a separate local access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10469.105s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And is it not consistent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10505.844s">[Reinfeld]</a>: All right, so the live stream to Zoom, though you're saying that our Zooms do get pushed to YouTube.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10519.295s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And that link's the same, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10606.777s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10608.138s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I was looking at that as the minutes and the notification, but Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10649.625s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I don't have a strong preference on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10653.989s">[Reinfeld]</a>: My sense is that the people who aren't watching it online want the channel numbers, but... I would, not to be difficult, but I would make a motion to amend to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10678.183s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I would say channel numbers and YouTube.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10732.774s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I will also say that these meetings, sorry, the notice is posted to the website where we have agreed to put that link.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10740.017s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So that link exists where meeting notification exists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10743.318s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I don't need that link on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10746.311s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think the channels make sense on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10748.912s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, so no YouTube link, just the channel numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10751.473s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Ruseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=12195.273s">[Reinfeld]</a>: incidents with the police report or the number of police reports?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=12197.934s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Because my understanding is there are sometimes multiple police reports filed around a single incident or is an incident defined as one student?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=12275.56s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I had a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=12276.26s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'd like to offer an amendment that the rate cards be accompanied by a historical perspective for these funds or history or for those that are recommending a rate change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=12290.366s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I don't know which one is more appropriate here, general history or just those with a change in mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=12387.23s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=88.632s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=815.094s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=815.835s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=816.075s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=817.396s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I was just going to thank Jerry again for being proactive and say, don't be embarrassed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=821.059s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We'd rather get the information sooner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=822.641s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=2470.117s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you, Jerry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=2472.078s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I am curious when the lags will catch up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=2476.36s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So when we'll know whether these numbers are lasting or temporary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=2482.003s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then I guess my other question is what ability do we have to see what the trends are?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=2486.985s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Because I'm seeing a lot of net losses and I'm curious how many of those are perpetuating from year to year and how many are anomalies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=2676.264s">[Reinfeld]</a>: For this cycle or for what's the timing on looking at that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=3058.439s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=3059.159s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, I was just wondering what's happening with potential budget presentation by Tracy Novick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=3065.303s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That's a math school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=3081.633s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=3081.993s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think it's super key.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=3102.384s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=4434.422s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Sorry, I had one more question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=4436.784s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I see in here that meals are the responsibility of the travelers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=4441.469s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is there a plan in place if there are students for whom that could pose a hardship to cover that in a sensitive, discreet way?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=4477.731s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And how many, yes, how many students are on the team here in Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=4799.651s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think we can move ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6021.206s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6022.067s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, I'm wondering how our programs compare.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6024.81s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I love that you've had this meeting and that you're moving forward with the other programs in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6029.916s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I tried to do a little bit of research and I see that our rates are on par.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6032.86s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Do they also have waitlists of similar sizes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6057.282s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then are there other, so you said in the current schools, you're using the cafeterias,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6066.386s">[Reinfeld]</a>: the libraries, the gyms, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6068.147s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And so I'm a museum educator by training, so I'm familiar with the informal or unstructured learning environments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6076.671s">[Reinfeld]</a>: What are the options elsewhere in the district, kind of beyond elementary schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6082.714s">[Reinfeld]</a>: What would we need to run that sort of program somewhere else or for someone to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6151.144s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I recognize staffing is certainly an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6154.248s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Are you competing with these other programs in Medford for staffing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6157.371s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is everyone trying to hire the same people?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6631.888s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6633.109s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6634.089s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6634.329s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Could you give us a sense of how the waitlist has grown, what the trend is here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6640.27s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is it getting, I assume it's getting bigger or is it leveling off?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6701.674s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I'd be really curious to see that as long as along with the numbers of percentage of people who are declining waitlist spots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6709.937s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I mean, I think if that's changing as well, that tells us something about how people are filling their needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6729.713s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, because I think you're absolutely right that the raw numbers don't tell the whole story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6734.556s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And so what are the key metrics here to understand how we are or are not meeting the need?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6740.48s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Because we hear a lot of anecdotes and what,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6743.806s">[Reinfeld]</a>: what's true across the district or in specific schools be really helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6810.906s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then one more, you may not have this answer until the end of the year, until next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6815.109s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So Ready, Set, Kids is a new program that was kind of formed in response to some of the challenges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6821.434s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Has it helped?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6879.98s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I know that's one difference in between, I know you said these problems are not unique to Medford, but I think there are communities around us that have many more options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6899.867s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I live next door to that one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=6901.667s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I see the space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=9502.18s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=9503.08s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=9503.821s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I was wondering if we could reorder things in the definition section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=9507.722s">[Reinfeld]</a>: The rest of this protocol does a great job of going from progressively, introducing progressively more<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=9515.758s">[Reinfeld]</a>: extreme conditions and I found myself jumping around and reading it backwards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=9522.905s">[Reinfeld]</a>: With the definitions that the outlook is kind of the first stage and then we're looking at the watches or the advisory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=9543.327s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But I think if we flip them, it'll make it more... I think the goal here was perhaps to make the excessive, the most extreme thing first, so we see that first, but it felt really inconsistent with... I'm happy to flip it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/wn9Gi3fuhEM&t=9557.918s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=0.049s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=0.109s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Or refer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2.73s">[Reinfeld]</a>: This.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=4.471s">[Reinfeld]</a>: To, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=6.372s">[Reinfeld]</a>: To Medford's Office of Sustainable Sustainability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=8.554s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I know our climate action plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=11.715s">[Reinfeld]</a>: References lead only, um, but either or invite.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=16.878s">[Reinfeld]</a>: The sustainable someone from the sustainability office at the city to comment on that as a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=39.998s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It's CHPS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=43.061s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I can put that in the document, I think, if that's useful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=47.014s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=48.034s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I didn't have time to do the research, but from what I've seen, it seems like there are some really important milestones for schools that we should be thinking about as people using the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=124.993s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That's fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=125.554s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think that's perhaps then included in one of the consultancies that the next section is gonna refer to to make sure that we have that consultancy in submitting our application.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=402.432s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, the or was simply because I haven't, I didn't have the time to do the research, but I'm going to trust the experts in the inboxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=415.574s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Or I accept your revision to my amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=452.715s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=454.976s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1068.141s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1069.723s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I support the idea of alternates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1073.026s">[Reinfeld]</a>: My big question on that is, if we lose committee members, we're going to need to, for the most part, replace that particular expertise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1082.314s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think this is a little bit what Member Ruseau was referring to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1086.277s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And so being really thoughtful about what that means.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1091.542s">[Reinfeld]</a>: because the building committee is we're choosing this not by lottery not we're choosing it very much based on expertise and I but I think it could certainly be added.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1101.733s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I guess my question to the superintendent is this for specifically for the members of the public or are we thinking about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1110.603s">[Reinfeld]</a>: the designated voting members who are actively fulfilling particular roles because I think if it's for the public, we can add a question to the application saying, would you be willing to serve as an alternate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1122.857s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then we would need to specify that the alternates are essentially a non, are they a non participatory but non voting member during the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1130.385s">[Reinfeld]</a>: and they move into a voting role, or is it they're observers for the whole process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1136.808s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So what does it mean to be an alternate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1611.562s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Do we need to put into this document the procedure for filling<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1617.173s">[Reinfeld]</a>: vacancies that arise, or is that something that the committee, the original appointed committee will say, if we lose members, this is our replacement plan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1672.878s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, and I because I agree with the process that member Ruseau out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1677.061s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think it was member Ruseau outlined if we go back if that expertise is there we take it there or give that first refusal, and then put out a call for specific expertise if needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1748.447s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, we did not address the question of Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1753.312s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Hodgkin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1755.214s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1756.615s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I would certainly support putting her as a non-voting member in the same capacity as Principal Fallon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1767.485s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It does bring us to an even number, which<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1771.3s">[Reinfeld]</a>: may or may not, although not voting, not on the voting, just in the room, I guess it's just pushing the numbers up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1778.184s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Are we like, and I was also looking back, is MEEP represented in Medford Family Network?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1784.288s">[Reinfeld]</a>: How are those, when we're talking about all the programs in the building, how are those represented here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1798.789s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And thank you for being here, how you come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1831.625s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Fantastic, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1869.913s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=1875.438s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2064.804s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2065.986s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We need to add email address or phone number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2068.909s">[Reinfeld]</a>: How do we contact these people?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2070.912s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Whoops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2085.435s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2085.876s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then do we want to know if they are a teacher or staff at a different school in Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2094.385s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We have high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2098.19s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I was torn on this, and so I... I guess that's a good question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2160.348s">[Reinfeld]</a>: If it were me, I'd be putting it in other relevant or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2165.669s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I want to be there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2167.831s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And just to make sure, just to confirm that Medford High School encompasses vocational actually, and I suppose Curtis Tufts as well, because we are looking at whether or not this becomes one facility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2196.428s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2628.97s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Not to the application, I just want to make sure that the application is posted with the necessary context of the goals of the committee that I think is outlined early on, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2640.333s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It can't just be a form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2642.313s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Perhaps it's a resolution and that explains what our goals are and who they're joining.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2659.564s">[Reinfeld]</a>: before I think I think the goals that we outlined are really helpful to say this is this is what this committee is looking to achieve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2666.166s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And yeah, I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2668.926s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2682.689s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And the shifting of the numbers with the addition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2685.834s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2686.755s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=2792.697s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I worry a little bit about getting all community members up to speed on Robert's rules of order, but if that's how open meeting has to be, that's how it has to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=3072.336s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I have a question for Dr. Dr Edouard-Vincent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=3075.477s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm wondering what the status of the project website is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=3079.739s">[Reinfeld]</a>: As per the last resolution to set that up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3PnEMQz0yA4&t=3112.474s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It wasn't when we wrote it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=321.391s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So this is partly a procedural question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=325.921s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Do we ask comments about the job description that's written, or is this just a pass?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=334.245s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Has this been posted?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=341.828s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I had a couple questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=343.429s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Just a question around the practice of salary measure of experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=348.151s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Do we ever post salary ranges for things?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=351.073s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm curious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=352.853s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Measure it for with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=354.878s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We don't post salary ranges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=357.619s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=358.099s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So that's a, that's a different conversation then about practices around that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=362.76s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Um, and then I was, I just wanted to ask about it's in the knowledge of progressive approach to enhance student dining experiences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=370.963s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I'm curious what that means and whether that means culturally inclusive or culturally sensitive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=377.925s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I'm wondering if that language,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=381.172s">[Reinfeld]</a>: can be added.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=382.493s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Progressive feels very big to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=469.727s">[Reinfeld]</a>: or to add culturally inclusive in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=1497.718s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=1499.1s">[Reinfeld]</a>: The question about community vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=1501.362s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is that part of a regular election cycle?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=1503.385s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is that a special election?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=1504.526s">[Reinfeld]</a>: What does that look like?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=2559.515s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I was gonna motion to approve, but I'll second, that's why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=2565.457s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=2566.158s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Are you not done, Member McLaughlin?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3661.053s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I am curious what expertise we already have here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3665.176s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Like I pretty sure we don't have people in the district who have been through a new construction process and that feels for new construction in a school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3677.487s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I'm curious what the expertise is and where our gaps are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3682.17s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then the other thing that I wanted to say is I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3685.811s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Defining the committee, I like the idea of starting with what we need and being really clear about the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3690.953s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I think putting that in addition to the committee, just the process of here are some key milestones for that community input at these stages is really going to be essential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3701.198s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And these are the points when we will evaluate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3702.839s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is the committee shifting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3705.8s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Are we rotating?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3707.702s">[Reinfeld]</a>: this position or that position, but I would like to know what expertise we currently have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3713.104s">[Reinfeld]</a>: The requirements say one principal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3714.805s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I feel like if we're talking about the Medford High School vocational combination, we actually need two principals there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3721.408s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So that kind of conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3723.588s">[Reinfeld]</a>: How big is our committee of people that we already have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3766.506s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then what are the gaps there that we would need for the core committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=3769.809s">[Reinfeld]</a>: What needs to be filled in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=4352.788s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So, to be a little bit clearer in terms of my saying what are our gaps, I think we should potentially be looking to fill particular functions and roles on the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=4362.835s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think absolutely representation is important, but what is it that we need to do to get this done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=4368.579s">[Reinfeld]</a>: This is a very logistical process, and particularly at<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=4373.142s">[Reinfeld]</a>: certain stages and in terms of educating the community about what this is, I would hate for us to run around finding all the things we could tell them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=4382.488s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think an FAQ would be really helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=4386.01s">[Reinfeld]</a>: What are the frequent questions we're getting and put together an answer on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=4390.232s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I do think there should be absolutely points for community input throughout the process, but perhaps in this initial stage, what are the key things that people are asking and that they want to know similar to what we did around<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=4402.611s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I hate to make the comparison to COVID, but there was a very soliciting input and then hopefully answering those questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=4411.334s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=4411.674s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Ruseau?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=4458.055s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=5587.493s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=5587.973s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That was my question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=5607.67s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I am willing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=5608.57s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I defer to a member who is willing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=5612.633s">[Reinfeld]</a>: If anyone is gung ho, they can have it, but I'm absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=5628.802s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That's going to be your excuse for everything now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/i48LtULfW6M&t=5699.019s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1927.216s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1930.118s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1931.959s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1932.88s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I'm new to school committee, so I haven't seen the presentations other than in passing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1937.963s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I have a couple of questions and I'll start with the accelerated math.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1944.027s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1944.467s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So my big question here is what is differentiation gonna look like in the seventh grade now that there's going to be a broader range of skills and abilities and comfort with math?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=1956.141s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And how are teachers going to be supported in meeting those wider needs without the trust?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2046.021s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And they have the opportunity to do some of the vertical integration talking to the grade below and the grade ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2071.252s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I have questions about the integrated math, but if any of my colleagues have things on the middle school, I want to make sure we can keep that together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2787.039s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you, Member Redfield.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2788.739s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So, Member Graham touched on my questions about education for families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2793.662s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And so a small question is, what kind of support is going to be available for students coming in from other districts who have had<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2800.575s">[Reinfeld]</a>: who were coming from the traditional path into the integrated?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2894.287s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I will say, I love the spiral model of education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2896.928s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think it's much more effective than the latter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2900.225s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So my next question is around that kind of interdisciplinary perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2903.666s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I know you've had a lot of conversation within the math department and digital learning, and how does this intersect with, say, the science courses, you know, chemistry, physics, where a lot of these concepts are coming into play, and at the vocational school, things like metalwork and carpentry, where that geometry foundation, and as much as I hate to reference standardized tests, academic milestones like the SATs, which lean really hard into the geometry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=2931.089s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So how is that being integrated kind of beyond the math department and making sure that those intersections, those alignments are matching up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3006.929s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3007.149s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And will they have the opportunity to do that peer-to-peer professional development in this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3011.93s">[Reinfeld]</a>: This is what worked for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3012.83s">[Reinfeld]</a>: This was my challenge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3013.751s">[Reinfeld]</a>: How can we help each other?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3055.412s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Well, thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3056.172s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thanks to your work and thank the committee as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=3058.414s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I know it's a lot on top of teaching to be thinking about that at this level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=8987.268s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Hi, Dr. Cushing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=8991.849s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So most of my questions were addressed particularly around the triggering of, you know, is this predicted heat for three days or is this actual because after three days it's already been excessive heat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9003.152s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I almost can't believe I'm asking this and this is to Member Ruseau's point about conversations we keep having over and over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9009.974s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Encouraging hydration bathroom policies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9015.208s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is there something built in there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9016.389s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I know this has been controversial across the district about access to bathrooms, but when we're encouraging hydration, this is going to impact that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9025.536s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is there something we need to be considering on that front?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9030.6s">[Reinfeld]</a>: At the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9032.881s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I haven't heard problems at other schools, but I do know frequency of students using the bathroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9040.199s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I've heard it disruptive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9041.319s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I mean, I know it's disruptive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9043.32s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Anyone trying to leave the house with a child knows it's disruptive, but just what that looks like in the policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9051.822s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then my other point is the acknowledgement of the services that school provide, but also perhaps an acknowledgement that many home environments are also unsafe in excessive heat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9089.763s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=9090.564s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10319.738s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10320.118s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10321.923s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I don't know if this is a point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10323.804s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think our policy is that we don't meet in August unless there's an emergency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10328.688s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I don't know if there are implications there in terms of a policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10334.032s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I think my question is, I would really like to know the schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10339.796s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It sounds like there are school updates in September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10342.398s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I know budget season is June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10344.88s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'd love to see budget conversations happen earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10348.182s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And so are we looking at mapping out<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10351.346s">[Reinfeld]</a>: what a typical year looks like or what a specific year looks like here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10357.068s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10404.267s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then my other question was just how does this intersect with the meeting we're having in two days?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10408.729s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I would certainly favor it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10411.784s">[Reinfeld]</a>: looking at this after I've kind of seen what a report cycle, what that looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10417.407s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Right, because the reports and the presentations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10618.011s">[Reinfeld]</a>: The email was sent on January 19th from Lisa requesting, I got an email on January 19th requesting the Committee of the Whole for January 31st at 5 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10628.294s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Specific to this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10629.794s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then I got the calendar specific to this to discuss requested reports for the remainder of the year to be held on January 31st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10638.137s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then I got the calendar invitation on January 22nd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10802.767s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Can we can I I'm not sure if this is an amendment to it but I have some things that I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10808.359s">[Reinfeld]</a>: would also like to see in this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10810.04s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10811.001s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, so I would like to see an assessment of how many or how much time full-time and part-time staff are spending covering when we don't have subs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10823.911s">[Reinfeld]</a>: You know, we just heard about an assistant principal who's coming in to do things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10827.513s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I've heard of co-teachers being pulled into another classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10831.596s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I would really like to understand what services are not being provided or what work isn't getting done when we are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10838.297s">[Reinfeld]</a>: cobbling together a substitute situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10840.899s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And the goal of, and I don't know if that's one of the key questions in the beginning, but the goal on that is to, I really appreciate the specificity of what is the need, what is the cost, what's it going to cost us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10854.711s">[Reinfeld]</a>: This to me is, what's it going to cost us if we don't fix the problem?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10858.715s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I'd like to see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10860.536s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then I don't have a great sense of what our history as a district is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10865.529s">[Reinfeld]</a>: in terms of long-term subs and building subs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10869.61s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I think that has fallen in and out of existence as people have and have not become available over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10878.732s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I know I had a student whose teacher, we had two maternity leaves in the same year and one of them had a long-term sub and the other had a cobbled together situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10887.694s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then our building, an elementary school had a building sub and then they didn't and so understanding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D85kYh8WU6M&t=10894.195s">[Reinfeld]</a>: what that looked like when those things were in place and when they haven't been, or even just what dates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=360.851s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=363.452s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=796.65s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I was curious, is there on our, I think there's a shared Google Drive that we got access to today, is there, does that have the archive of the meetings and kind of agendas of what these committees have done?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=808.719s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=810.421s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=1029.712s">[Reinfeld]</a>: You did tell us our first meeting we attended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=1080.863s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to sever the minutes from December 18th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=1103.656s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTAFqIlEOR4&t=1114.483s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I motion to approve these with the correction of the spelling of my name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=121.79s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to enter executive session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3881.687s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3882.928s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I don't want to repeat the questions from Member Ruseau and Member Olapade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3888.072s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I do want to say I've worked with a number of programs in this sort of thing, and I have found that City Year is one of the more supportive, providing the support to employees than some of the other similar programs and even those as part of the AmeriCorps program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3904.203s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I found City Year to be really a solid<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3907.345s">[Reinfeld]</a>: partner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3907.745s">[Reinfeld]</a>: The question that I have maybe is for the administration more than you, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3914.331s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Roberts, it's around what this looks like in terms of planning coming into the school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3920.555s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think we've, anyone who has been in education or well really many, many jobs, it's not exclusive to education, has had a student teacher, an intern come in and that can often be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3930.683s">[Reinfeld]</a>: more work for the person supervising, obviously for great benefit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3934.546s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I really, really support programs that are teaching these skills and giving these community collaborations an opportunity to grow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3943.854s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So it's not about that, but what kind of foundation and conversations<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3949.398s">[Reinfeld]</a>: would we be having with the teachers and the administration in the schools, particularly noting that we are now in the summer period and many of the staff will be coming back right before school starts and moving in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3963.535s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So it's a question about onboarding and the commitment for what it looks like on the ground for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3969.321s">[Reinfeld]</a>: really being able to get this going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3972.064s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I appreciate what Member Olapade said, that this is an and, not an or, but even adding ands to the top of already very full jobs is a lot of work, and I'd love to hear about how that is managed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4088.277s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm sorry, the other part of that was making sure the teachers and support staff that are being worked with have the opportunity to express that this is our specific need in this specific year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4861.226s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, I could, I apologize, this might have been said already, but is the third, we're talking about an elementary school and a single classroom, is the third grade a fixed point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4873.29s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Because I think the schools that we're looking at, particularly the Mississippi is where we've had a lot of concerns about the average class size being a lot for a single teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4883.353s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And that's not necessarily in the third grade, for example, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4889.275s">[Reinfeld]</a>: What kind of, how does this intersect with our class size questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4895.439s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We're having another adult in the room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=4914.793s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So it's not fixed for a particular grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5758.581s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Branley, you're muted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5880.609s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yep, I think these are all really valid concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5883.011s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But I also think this is an opportunity to pilot what community partnership looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5887.835s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And that's something we should be doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5889.877s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That's a way forward in making Medford a great place to learn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5893.74s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And so I can hear concerns, maybe two programs is too much for a pilot, given the uncertainties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5900.166s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5902.645s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think this is something we can learn from, and it will lay a foundation for being able to have more partnership, more community support, training people to be in education and make a difference in students' lives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5915.669s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think it's a valuable pilot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7420.567s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So versus tabling the motion versus tabling this until we see that plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7521.285s">[Reinfeld]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8432.816s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, thank you, Mr. McHugh and everybody who contributed conversations both within the administration and within the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8441.603s">[Reinfeld]</a>: These were not easy conversations, and I appreciate the clarity of the story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8446.026s">[Reinfeld]</a>: One thing that this story doesn't tell that I think it's important to say on the floor in this meeting is that this whole process has revealed a lot of important conversations that need to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8459.096s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It has the potential cuts from the initial budget proposal have revealed the challenges in the high school schedule, the middle school schedule, the enrollment and distribution of students across the schools, particularly the elementary schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8474.603s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It's raised questions about the stipend rates and then the timing of the budget cycle itself and how it coincides with non-renewals and everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8484.748s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I think that is really important<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8486.989s">[Reinfeld]</a>: to keep in mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8488.37s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It's not immediately germane to the approval of the budget at hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8493.493s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But the one thing that I would like to do, I would like to make a motion that the school committee receive a report by December 7th describing the implementation and impact of the position reductions that were not related to enrollment, just to understand how the intended and unintended consequences of the decisions are going to affect next year's budget request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8513.807s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Because what I hate seeing in budgeting is when<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8517.249s">[Reinfeld]</a>: a position goes away, and I will say I'm particularly concerned about some of the middle school positions, but when it goes away and then we never go back to say, how did that pan out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8529.718s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Things just disappear and fall off the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8532.42s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I would like to see a report to inform the next budget cycle of how those impacts affected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8559.849s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8561.031s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I had phrased it, the report describing the implementation and impact of position reductions between the previous and current year budgets to understand the unintended and the intended, sorry, the intended and unintended consequences of these decisions will affect the budget request for the upcoming fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8580.035s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm happy to send that to someone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8658.347s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That's all I have to say for now, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9500.388s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Quick clarification, are the kindergarten teacher numbers based on projected enrollment or current actual enrollment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9545.288s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, because I was curious and I will say, I'm more familiar with the Roberts just because that is where I have a student because the projected enrollment is the same as the current enrollment, but the number of teachers in the budget is less than the current number of teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9561.958s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So that is an increase in class size that we're expecting, we're not sure if we're gonna need<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9620.039s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Does the housing market play a role in that in terms of, you know, I know there are neighborhoods where we're seeing a lot of younger families move in unrelated to birth rates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9643.997s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Right, okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9891.995s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That's contractual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9895.777s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It's in the teacher's contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9897.238s">[Reinfeld]</a>: All the stipend rates are there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10067.054s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10948.726s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10978.942s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11362.389s">[Reinfeld]</a>: OK, in phase 2.2c, the capital projects not eligible for community preservation or net school spending, those just get incorporated into the plan itself and don't need any kind of special call out for funding requests, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11438.741s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And so then following on that, it's presumably out of the scope of this policy to request from the city that they respond to the phase five here, the approved, go forward it to the city of Medford with the funding request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11453.991s">[Reinfeld]</a>: we're going to assume, hello, we're going to assume that we get that information back, but that's outside the scope of the policy, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11480.711s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I just wanted to make sure this is this communication is coming both ways and we're seeing in a timely manner I think the way that city council and school committee can work together on this and of course the mayor's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11493.464s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then I was curious how this interfaces with our consent agenda where we are approving purchases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11501.108s">[Reinfeld]</a>: If it's in the capital plan and in the budget, we still need to approve the actual spending of the money when appropriated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11508.611s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11509.872s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then my very last thing, I also did not find any typos, but I think that phase seven, number one, I think the two sentences should each be their own item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11523.461s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Phase 7, 1, net school spending, and then the attachment should be a separate motion to amend it in that way, if I have to make a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11561.351s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm happy to motion to waive the second reading this feels, but I was, you know what, I was on this, I was on the committee in the room when this was made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11568.216s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So let me turn it over to colleagues who are not on the strategic planning, capital planning subcommittee.<br><br>
