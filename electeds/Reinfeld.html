    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=128.409s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to sever June 24th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=153.433s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'd like to amend the approval of the teacher budget line item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=157.434s">[Reinfeld]</a>: The vote was 5-0-2, not 5-1-1.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=161.116s">[Reinfeld]</a>: There were two abstentions, no no votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1676.263s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1677.404s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is there a limitation on the number of schools from a district who can apply for this kind of thing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1693.899s">[Reinfeld]</a>: because I love this and you know I have a kid at the Roberts, so I'm super excited, but I also want to be thinking about our other elementary schools and equity across the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1903.465s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2874.85s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So there were 90 enrolled, 30 got to do Summer Fun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2877.891s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Were there people who wanted to do Summer Fun that didn't get to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3213.001s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So the students who didn't pass, what support is available?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3217.003s">[Reinfeld]</a>: What happens next for them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3879.437s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Remind me from June, this was to cover the program for one year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3883.06s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Remind me of the scope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3903.401s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So remember Russo touched on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3904.843s">[Reinfeld]</a>: What was the percentage of students who accepted?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3908.285s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We talked a lot in June about strategies for outreach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3961.961s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, do we have an opportunity to compare the students who participated with the students who didn't, whether that's through early DIBELS, early MAP, or even qualitative?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4011.953s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Because it would just be interesting to see if there was any kind of significant shift in scores comparing, looking across the cohort that was invited, those who participated and those who didn't, assuming they were on similar tiers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4025.247s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4025.607s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then my last question is, it seems like there was a lot of great teacher feedback about the format and how this works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4031.753s">[Reinfeld]</a>: How can we use the lessons that were learned in this summer experience to apply them or scale them up as we're looking at more intensive literacy training with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4044.95s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Hill and others?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5672.463s">[Reinfeld]</a>: May I ask what that looks like?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5675.684s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is that initiated by school committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5677.404s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is that initiated by the district?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5725.509s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And the population is changing a lot in Fulton Heights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6045.567s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I would love to see that committee of the whole meeting happen this fall once those numbers are presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6507.321s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Well, I would like to motion that the capital planning subcommittee in an upcoming meeting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6513.996s">[Reinfeld]</a>: dedicate an agenda item to identifying a scope and timeline for coordinated electrification across the district, because we can't keep doing this on a one-off as things fail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6524.958s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, this one's too expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6526.898s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And they all end up being too expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6528.819s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We have to do this look big picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6531.219s">[Reinfeld]</a>: This was the last one to fail, but what's next?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6537.24s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6539.621s">[Reinfeld]</a>: The capital planning subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6541.001s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6547.844s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Do you need more language?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6549.524s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I got enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6550.365s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6929.215s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm just curious why this wouldn't go towards other transportation related costs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6934.856s">[Reinfeld]</a>: If it is a parking fee for vehicles and a. Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7238.561s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reichelt?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7239.321s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm just curious whether we get any remuneration from these companies that delayed our process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7245.783s">[Reinfeld]</a>: You said they accepted full responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7249.024s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is that just an I'm sorry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7304.163s">[Reinfeld]</a>: No, it sounds like the project is going as smoothly as it can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7307.185s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I just want to thank the McGlynn Elementary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7308.846s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I know, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7310.347s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank the McGlynn Elementary community for their patience on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9454.002s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reindell?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9454.422s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Quick question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9455.263s">[Reinfeld]</a>: The priority on local produce, I absolutely see it reflected in the lunches.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9460.49s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Can we also expect to see it reflected in the breakfasts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9463.936s">[Reinfeld]</a>: which I think tend to be a little more carbon packaged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9664.853s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I love the efficiency of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9666.273s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I just want to make sure we're being aware of the effect that certain LED lights can have on headaches, migraines for the student health reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9677.808s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9678.068s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So just something to keep in mind proactively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9681.175s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10151.63s">[Reinfeld]</a>: there any other motions associated with this policy motion to waive this is this the sort of thing where we can waive the second reading because this is very much aligned with the massachusetts association of school committee recommendations so motion to waive the second reading i don't think we should do that no all right withdraw the motion okay so this will be on the agenda again next week for a final reading got it<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10247.004s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I had a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10248.084s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10248.525s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So my only question is if this is something that we need to hear from the department that's requesting the field trip or we need to acknowledge the grant by some terms of the grant, we would then just sever it from the consent agenda to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10260.809s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10261.369s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9683.445s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I sort of hate to ask this, and this is not to curtail artistic integrity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9689.886s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Either do we have community standards for what gets painted, or is there a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9697.117s">[Reinfeld]</a>: protocol in place if somehow something that shouldn't be in the lot shows up in the lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9707.383s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I trust our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9708.764s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think they're great, but I just want to have that backup.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9735.177s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I'm not a fan of censorship.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9737.278s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I just wanted, things can happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10150.718s">[Reinfeld]</a>: All those opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10153.759s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I have a question about the $75 to park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10156.16s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is that just during school hours?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10157.88s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Because I have seen in districts where you're not parking during the day, but if you are doing some sort of activity that has you there late at night, sports things, theater things run in, sometimes the car comes in after when bus service isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10206.578s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I just want to say that I...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10209.372s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, I think we shouldn't be charging people to get to school, but we charge for people to take the bus, and I don't think that parking should be free when we're charging families to pay for their own T-passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10223.575s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think there's inequity and environmental impact to that decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10790.737s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10791.777s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10792.198s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So my goal here is to give this body the opportunity to articulate how these ballot questions map to the needs of our school community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10800.803s">[Reinfeld]</a>: These are the three questions that I believe most directly affect the student and educator experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10806.927s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I do intend to divide this motion so that each component can be voted on separately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10812.29s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm happy to do that now or give an overview of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10818.455s">[Reinfeld]</a>: of what I've laid out here, described the ballot question, mapped it to the needs, and articulated a position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10826.16s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm happy to note rate question two is about eliminating the MCAS test, not as a required assessment, but as a graduation requirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10834.806s">[Reinfeld]</a>: This is something that Medford educators and parents have been asking for for many years, and it allows our educators to better focus on diverse learning styles, needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10845.173s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It expands the definition of success.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10847.202s">[Reinfeld]</a>: reduces anxiety, and increases equity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10850.645s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Question seven is a direct response to the budget crisis that we saw last spring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10855.029s">[Reinfeld]</a>: To replace those one-time funds, we all, I assume, remember how devastating the $2.7 million worth of cuts, plus the 2.2 million that we didn't even identify what those would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10867.821s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So that's valid question seven, along with the...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10872.385s">[Reinfeld]</a>: The Department of Public Works, we've spent a lot of time talking about transportation and how there are not necessarily viable alternatives for our families and students within certain distances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10882.911s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Some of that is on busing, which is also addressed by the ballot initiatives, but also on street and sidewalk repair, which makes safer environments for everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10893.097s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then question eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10894.935s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think really addresses the challenges, these underlying challenges that we have seen come up, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10901.258s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We heard enrollment in the arts is low and it's not because students don't want to be taking arts, it's because they don't have room in their schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10908.861s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Many people enrolled in vocational programs aren't able to take the AP courses that will assist in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10915.243s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And so I just found out that my fourth grader in taking<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10921.471s">[Reinfeld]</a>: starting an instrument is probably going to be missing art class or science class every week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10928.253s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And that's a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10931.794s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And so we need to expand what we offer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10934.435s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We probably need to expand the teacher workday, the student learning opportunities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10940.217s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We are at the state minimum for how much time students, instructional time students have in class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10946.218s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But if we're gonna ask people to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10949.496s">[Reinfeld]</a>: to spend more time in the classroom, we have to pay them for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10952.197s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We found out how low many of our stipends are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10956.379s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We have been hearing for years about competition with other districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10961.14s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And so that is question eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10965.042s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then the final section of this motion is an acknowledgement that this doesn't solve all the problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10969.803s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We are still committed as a body to working to make sure<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10974.798s">[Reinfeld]</a>: our students and educators have what they need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10977.761s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I welcome edits or additions from my colleagues, and I really appreciate the opportunity to articulate how these three valid questions impact our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11005.473s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So what's our definition?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11013.619s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, it says this test is not the key thing that says yes or no, you graduate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11420.451s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think we, sorry, I think, Simon, are you here for this question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11425.613s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm so sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11426.514s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We have our frequent flyer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11430.576s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Would you like to speak?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11489.402s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I have some, I have a couple of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11491.263s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeldt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11492.124s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I'm curious what happened to the language about student use and signage from the original policy or what's online?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11519.244s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11519.704s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So on that one, I would want to add nicotine pouches and gum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11524.445s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I'm not sure if that belongs in the staff one as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11527.886s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But that's a non-tobacco product, but it is, this is things like Zin and yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11539.569s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So it's not tobacco, but it is nicotine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11542.209s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11552.743s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Nicotine pouches.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11555.764s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I actually wasn't sure about gum because I know some people need that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11559.366s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I don't know what our school policy is on gum actually, but I know that's helping to combat addiction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11572.431s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think we should.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11573.571s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Not patches, pouches, the pop in your mouth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11581.63s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, I have our assistant super chair saying yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9508.884s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Can we see a copy of what the baseline numbers look like?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9514.869s">[Reinfeld]</a>: What is elevated?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9515.909s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is zero the baseline on everything?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10349.916s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I have three questions, two of them for Director Perry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10353.86s">[Reinfeld]</a>: You said HECAT framework changes to curriculum end of year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10357.043s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is that end of calendar year or end of school year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10365.401s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10366.081s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then I was wondering at the middle school level, how the reduction in guidance counselors has affected the delivery of health education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10373.662s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I know that was a big question during budget season about the teaching responsibilities with that position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10398.553s">[Reinfeld]</a>: have other, do they have room in their schedule for other activities?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10402.294s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That was one of the things that concerns were expressed about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10418.52s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10419.06s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And then my third question was just to confirm that the caregiver university is an a la carte model.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10424.462s">[Reinfeld]</a>: People can tune in and out to different sessions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10426.863s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It's not an enrollment based.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=10429.292s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13062.046s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Member Reinfeld?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13062.846s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, I was just wondering what opportunities there are for teachers to give feedback or share<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13069.892s">[Reinfeld]</a>: how well it is working for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13071.413s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I realize there's still a lot of training going on, but that formative assessment of, is this curriculum working for us and for the people who are delivering it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13079.577s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I can see a lot of these meetings coming, we're looking at the student data and we're really focused on the students, which is absolutely important, but I, where the teacher voice and their experience, is that happening in the PD sessions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13096.305s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is that happening in the weekly meetings?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13196.451s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And participation on the DLT is volunteer basis?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13200.635s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13201.455s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And we don't turn anybody away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13205.358s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But there's no stipend?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13487.255s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I would like to amend this the same way I amended last week's to include nicotine pouches and non, we have the phrasing in last week's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13496.929s">[Reinfeld]</a>: minutes to include nicotine pouches and state exclusion of prescription nicotine products, such as patches prescribed to end nicotine dependence and addiction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1659.227s">[Reinfeld]</a>: My question is what of these<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1663.68s">[Reinfeld]</a>: can or should be bundled right does it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1666.322s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Do we need to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1668.224s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Does it help to do all the HVAC together because of a vendor or because of timing, or is everything here, like the roof rebuilds does it not matter which building it's on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2033.922s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, that reminds me of one of the resolutions we just had, I think last month or maybe it was the beginning of this month, around understanding what the needs to upgrade electrical systems to move away from fossil fuels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2049.485s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I realize that's not a specific project, but that's something we want to be planning for so that we're not kind of forced into making these decisions around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2062.308s">[Reinfeld]</a>: just on the basis of cost and availability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2067.309s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So that's an assessment that we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2152.518s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Though presumably that's the kind of thing, I guess then that question comes to the same question we had before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2159.284s">[Reinfeld]</a>: If we wait on that, does the price go up or down?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2161.506s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Because some capital projects, the price goes up if you don't do it right away, and sometimes it goes down significantly if you give it a year for the technology to catch up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2171.434s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So which direction does this lean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2176.378s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Do we know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2284.744s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So that, and so the cost of doing that is people's time, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2289.112s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Or is it time and training?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2292.385s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is it hiring of people?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2352.731s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay, then my other question in terms of making this list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2357.796s">[Reinfeld]</a>: These are all the things that we know are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2362.6s">[Reinfeld]</a>: going to be big problems soon-ish.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2367.522s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is there a kind of middle tier list of things that we know are coming in the medium term, but if we don't proactively maintain them, they're going to get worse and become even exponentially more expensive to fix?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2382.409s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I'm thinking about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2385.615s">[Reinfeld]</a>: The analogy here is things like our roads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2387.596s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It's a lot harder to repair roads that are severely weather damaged and potholes and all of this than to do maintenance on things that are showing wear and tear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2400.084s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And that saves us from doing desperate repairs later on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2406.108s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I know we didn't, I didn't ask you to prepare this in advance of this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2409.811s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So maybe this is a better question for November, but I want to think about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2416.963s">[Reinfeld]</a>: what we need to fix now to stop it from becoming a huge cost?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2643.626s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2644.426s">[Reinfeld]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2645.067s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2645.888s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I wanted to put those things out there as they have to be factored in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2650.952s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think we're probably at a point where we need to now start that prioritization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2821.024s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I mean, ADA compliance to me feels like we really need to get in compliance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2830.551s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But tell me more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2832.593s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I know we're waiting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2834.014s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I know we had identified some things at the high school, and I think we're waiting for member Branley to call the building and grounds meeting on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2843.441s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Does this go with that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2956.877s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I will recognize that I jumped on member Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2959.217s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think he was also going to say something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2961.898s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We should see that we should finish this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3024.364s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I just moved that up with the like recommissioning assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3027.765s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, I was going to say that category is recommissioning for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3053.311s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Sorry, one other thing on that one, on electrification, is that, is there any sort of grant to support that assessment for climate mitigation, for energy, alternative energies?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3073.98s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3077.145s">[Reinfeld]</a>: but that seems like something that should be supported.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3160.415s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Well, and on the drainage, is there any, I know that's something that you were really thinking about with the new McGlynn playground because, I mean, that playground was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3173.14s">[Reinfeld]</a>: regularly not draining to understatement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3186.009s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So it's not a drainage issue, but there is a drainage issue there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3192.374s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I was just wondering if there's a service contract to be maintaining<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3198.072s">[Reinfeld]</a>: this turf setting, does it also, is it possible to bundle that with the other school, even though they're, however- I believe the turf is being, I believe we are finally on the maintenance contract at the Brooks, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3214.777s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3217.418s">[Reinfeld]</a>: With the door sweeps, there was also a dumpster mitigation that I wrote down that I don't see in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3226.368s">[Reinfeld]</a>: the general, there were two pest control issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3285.232s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And that's all one project?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3286.592s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That should all be in line 27 or are they separate lines?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3592.113s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, part of my question on that is, what does that do to summer programs that we're offering in different schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3600.481s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I know most of our programming this summer was at Missittuck and high school, unless I'm missing something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3610.811s">[Reinfeld]</a>: In the Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3612.232s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3761.242s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, as I recall, there's the determination based on what the project is, and then there's also a funding threshold, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3767.707s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Because I'm looking, if I'm remembering correctly, and I might not be, it was 250,000 was a cutoff, and I'm looking right there at network closet mini split.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3784.019s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And I don't know what borderline is gonna dictate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3787.754s">[Reinfeld]</a>: how things are classified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3788.935s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So if that's if we need to look at that quote a little more carefully for that determination, we might need to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3798.302s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So I'm sure knows that number much better than I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3835.523s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I mean, the only thing that comes to mind is we have talked about getting elementary school students into middle school spaces, whether it's after school or some other reorganization down the line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3851.949s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I don't know that that is concrete enough, but I know that when I spoke to Nick Tucci, for example, the concerns around having elementary school students in there would require some changes to classrooms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3872.338s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I don't know what the timeframe is that maybe the superintendent knows that a little bit better or somebody who's been talking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3878.061s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I know we're due to get an update on after school at the Andrews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3882.243s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But that is something that is potentially a capital project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3892.249s">[Reinfeld]</a>: If we're looking at changing who is in the middle school building, the what are currently the middle school buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3918.303s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah, quite capital, but right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3921.164s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That's a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3944.21s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I guess, Dr. Cushing, you mentioned the roof as being ready for solar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3950.251s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Are there other solar projects that are possibilities down the line?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3957.361s">[Reinfeld]</a>: you mentioned that for the Andrews, are we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4059.608s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4060.889s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4061.209s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I was talking to a third grader who apparently they like to be fed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4066.372s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4067.032s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It's weird.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4068.253s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4072.446s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Oh, fourth grade, whoops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4073.807s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Anyway, I was gonna say, I think this is when I was having audio trouble, but anything Curtis Tufts, I assume that those calculations are being made with MSBA thinking in mind of what's worth doing in a building if we really are looking to co-locate and that five to seven, sorry, five year plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4098.926s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4227.081s">[Reinfeld]</a>: No, we have that date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4228.402s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4267.302s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So does that take the place of adjournment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4269.422s">[Reinfeld]</a>: That is correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4270.043s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2140.529s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Yes, so this presentation was very much about remediation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2143.852s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I am wondering, while we have these folks on the line, if there's anything we need to be keeping in mind for a new building that could potentially be coming to Medford in the next few years, we hope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2224.608s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Absolutely, of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2225.709s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Are there resources available to help with some of that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2229.25s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It's not remediation if it hasn't happened yet, but you mentioned grants for getting filling stations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2237.153s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is that sort of thing available for new installations?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4445.746s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Thank you for being here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4448.823s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I just wanted to ask if you are thinking about expanding the pool of drivers or what is the main impediment there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4456.79s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is it salary?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4458.271s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is it the timing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4459.332s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Is it just a fixed thing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4460.693s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And the reason I'm asking is as we look to plan for the next few years, what are some things that we maybe could expect in order to get the pool of people we needed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4474.043s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I think member Graham's questions around how we can support the people who are already there<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4479.15s">[Reinfeld]</a>: are really key, but looking at expanding the pool, like once people are in as drivers, do they stay or are we losing people partway through the year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4487.753s">[Reinfeld]</a>: What can we do to make sure we have more people?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4525.106s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4525.366s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And would we be looking at that going up in the future?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4527.587s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It's going to go up every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4651.843s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Like if we shifted school days, that's not going to make a difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=4657.13s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I mean, I live right in Medford Square.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3573.878s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I just want to comment kind of a combination of these last two questions about transparency in the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3578.479s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So member Graham already mentioned that the budget process is by law an open budgeting process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3584.041s">[Reinfeld]</a>: But I want to say we in Bethlehem Public Schools are in a really good position to be transparent about things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3589.983s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Our budget process got incredibly cleaned up by our last finance director who continues to consult one of the smoothest, most well accounted for budgeting that we've seen in quite a while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3601.866s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I was not school committee, but I watched the meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3604.487s">[Reinfeld]</a>: It is a clean budget book.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3605.767s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We know where the money's going, how it's being spent, and we're going to continue to have those public meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3610.148s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We have a new capital planning process policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3613.328s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We have open subcommittee meetings where these things are happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3616.469s">[Reinfeld]</a>: They're happening in public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3617.509s">[Reinfeld]</a>: These conversations, we are collecting input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3619.989s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So we are in a really good position to show what is happening in the schools, where the money is going, and how it is responding to the needs that we're hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3631.613s">[Reinfeld]</a>: from our department heads, from administration, from our vendors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3636.899s">[Reinfeld]</a>: This is a good time to be transparent and we're ready to do that with these questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4723.358s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I did look at these numbers when I was doing some of the analysis and our levels are back to where they were right before the pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4732.16s">[Reinfeld]</a>: So when people left the school to have their needs met elsewhere, they're coming back to Medford and they're coming back with significant need based on not just the pandemic, but just general student needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4748.724s">[Reinfeld]</a>: And so I think things are going up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4919.626s">[Reinfeld]</a>: I was just going to say, we got here because we made decisions that filled short-term needs, that were band-aids, and we didn't look.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4932.481s">[Reinfeld]</a>: Far ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5004.756s">[Reinfeld]</a>: We're making decisions based on the money that's available and what we can and can't do, not necessarily what is best for students in the long term from the school side.<br><br>
