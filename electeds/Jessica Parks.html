 <p>[Jessica Parks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=653.896s">Jessica</a> Parks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=657.018s">Thank</a> you so much for having us here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=659.299s">My</a> name is Jessica Parks, and I'm excited to be running for school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=662.761s">I'm</a> committed to rethinking our approach to budgeting, expanding opportunities for open and honest dialogue, and most importantly, building systems that support educators and meet the needs of all learners, ensuring everyone is engaged, valued, and heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=677.768s">A</a> year and a half ago, I <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=679.889s">I</a> did not think I would be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=681.27s">I</a> watched my nine-year-old son, Simon, unexpectedly speak at a school committee meeting in opposition to proposed teacher cuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=688.672s">Seeing</a> him speak so proudly and unafraid reminded me of why I bring him to these meetings and how powerful community engagement is when we show up, speak out for what we believe in, and do the work even when it's difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=701.037s">That</a> reminder was the catalyst for creating a petition signed by over 500 residents on behalf of our Mississippi teachers, which then became volunteering with the Invest in Medford override campaign, where Simon and I knocked on doors every weekend listening to your stories about our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=718.293s">Some</a> of these stories highlighted frustration with the lack of an after-school program, <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=723.518s">Although</a> we made it off the wait list four years ago, I was driven to find solutions through the creation of an afterschool task force. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=730.703s">As</a> a planner and project manager, I have a track record of strategic thinking and creative problem solving. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=736.908s">As</a> such, I focused our task force on case studies and data from five neighboring districts and 64 afterschool programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=745.094s">This</a> work helped move the discussion forward, allowing us to focus on the potential of our district program. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=751.058s">Although</a> we just started we've already seen a 21 percent increase in spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=755.341s">We</a> expanded the task force to include representation from each school and brought in an external consultant to develop strategies for scaling up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=764.445s">This</a> is the kind of collaboration and action I will bring to the school committee by listening to needs assembling the right team analyzing data and turning ideas into real measurable results to be tracked over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=776.232s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Jessica Parks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1935.069s">So</a> I believe that communication needs to be more consistent transparent and easily accessible. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1944.498s">I</a> think that families and caregivers often send multiple e-mails on the same topic to school officials because they believe information isn't shared properly or clearly and I <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1960.415s">Educators</a> and staff I speak with feel they lack a voice outside of bargaining periods. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1965.197s">So</a> we really need to kind of work on providing clear and consistent information about what's happening across the district both externally and internally. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1978.142s">And</a> ways to do that in order to kind of, because when staff and school committee members are receiving multiple emails on the same topic, it takes away from their day-to-day. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1990.711s">It</a> takes away from the teaching. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1991.971s">It</a> takes away from the leading. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=1993.633s">It</a> takes away from everything if they have to answer individual emails. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2000.457s">parents</a> need to feel that they're being heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2003.741s">And</a> so I think that, you know, websites that are easy to navigate, I think if there are topics that are hot button topics, you know those ahead of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2014.011s">You</a> know that after school is going to be a hot button topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2017.235s">You</a> know that <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2019.097s">A</a> change in curriculum is going to be a hot-button topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2022.439s">You</a> know that bus schedules are going to be a hot-button topic, and if bus timing is changing, you need to be able to communicate that clearly. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2032.607s">So</a> doing the communication up front and making sure that it's happening regularly through different methods of communication, not just a website, but it's the website, it's the email, <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2046.538s">It's</a> the talking points, because not everyone understands things the same way. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2054.063s">People</a> are visual. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2055.124s">People</a> like to hear things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2057.085s">People</a> like to read things at their own time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2060.487s">And</a> making sure you're tapping all of those different outlets, I think that could help a lot and go a long way. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2067.892s">As</a> a project manager, I work with buildings that are occupied, and I carry out projects in them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2075.677s">I</a> did recently did a project in a lab building and they were carrying out research while I was going in and doing HVAC work and we have to communicate with those buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=2086.141s">So.</a> 
 <p>[Jessica Parks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3298.728s">Can</a> you repeat that question?
 <p>[Jessica Parks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3314.48s">My</a> approach to issues with book challenges would, I think, be communication with whoever is challenging them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3328.9s">It</a> would reflect back to currently I think there is the Massachusetts state law and then also in action in Medford public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3341.129s">There's</a> the ability for a parent to request that their child is exempt from certain area from a piece of curriculum due to religious <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3356.06s">exemption</a> and so that they could sit out from that curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3360.023s">And</a> so but I think that court to that is just having a conversation and understanding truly what is at the core of that challenge and <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3374.045s">you</a> know, conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3375.947s">I</a> think conversations really help get at the essence of what is the challenge, what is, what a possible solution is, and, you know, is there a possible solution? <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3387.836s">Is</a> there a way around this? <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3388.917s">Because</a> I do think that when there are challenges to materials that are taught in schools or children are, <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3397.404s">kept</a> from learning certain aspects of our curriculum, that not only does that child lose out, but the rest of the class loses out as well when the child does come back into the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3411.377s">The</a> other part of the question was LGBTQ. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3416.822s">I</a> think there was recently a policy passed, which I am in favor of, but I also think that we need to help change language surrounding our papers that go home. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3436.993s">You</a> know, instead of saying daughter and son or he, she on permission slips, we need to start saying they, them and child. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3449.038s">And</a> I think my time is up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=3453.639s">Jenny</a> Graham.
 <p>[Jessica Parks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=4546.46s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Jessica Parks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=5911.725s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=5913.365s">The</a> core of my campaign is truly meeting the needs of all learners. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=5917.706s">I</a> struggled as a student and was diagnosed with learning disabilities in high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=5922.388s">I've</a> seen how confusing the IEP process can be through our former foster child and I have a kiddo who quickly finishes classwork to go on his Chromebook. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=5931.19s">I've</a> heard from so many of you that I'm not alone in these experiences. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=5936.857s">Every</a> student, whether they struggle to access the curriculum, need alternative learning methods, or seek more challenges, deserves appropriate supports and opportunities to stay engaged in Medford's public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=5948.008s">instead</a> of having to look elsewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=5949.97s">To</a> make this happen, we must empower our educators, provide families with tools to advocate effectively and standardize procedures while measuring their success, because no child should fall through the cracks due to language barriers, financial limitations, or lack of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=5964.999s">Every</a> student deserves an IEP, not just as a label of remediation, but as a roadmap for growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=5971.223s">Open,</a> honest, consistent communication is essential to make well-informed decisions, but communication isn't only about sharing updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=5979.11s">It's</a> also about listening, building trust, and addressing issues before they escalate. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=5984.334s">My</a> experience communicating complex projects will be an asset here, and I will work to expand opportunities through office hours, regular coffee hours at the schools for educators, staff, and students, and one-on-one conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=5997.025s">In</a> closing, and full disclosure, public speaking is not in my comfort zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6001.987s">But</a> it's about doing the work, even when it's difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6004.948s">And</a> with me, you're voting for someone who will listen, and someone who will work to turn your issues into concrete plans and follow through, whether that is helping one student or the whole district. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6015.251s">And</a> as you've heard, Medford needs a permanent superintendent and to create an updated strategic plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6021.638s">Who</a> better to be on the team than a project manager with a track record of strategic solutions and bringing diverse voices to the table? <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6028.945s">When</a> you vote for me, you're choosing someone who will build systems that support educators and meet the needs of all learners, ensuring everyone is engaged, supported, and heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/ntWR6BrwZ7g&t=6037.675s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-09-08_XXXXXX00137/2025-09-08_XXXXXX00137.html">Jessica Parks, Candidate for School Committee</a></h2>
 <p>[Jessica Parks]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=53.416s">Thanks,</a> Danielle. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=54.576s">Jessica</a> Parks, she, her, I am. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=60.483s">Running</a> for school committee currently. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=63.425s">I</a> am a mom to a new fifth grader. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=68.388s">I</a> lived in Medford for almost 14 years now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=75.012s">I'm</a> a project manager for energy efficiency projects at MIT and have a background in urban planning. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=86.459s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=86.939s">Thanks</a> for having me.
 <p>[Jessica Parks]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=112.386s">Well,</a> I think there are a bunch of things. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=118.236s">I</a> like to eat around Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=120.557s">Definitely</a> the fried chicken sandwich at Deep Cuts and currently the seafood pie at Mrs. Murphy's. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=128.442s">But</a> my all time favorite place is always Colleen's and it's the peppermint stick ice cream with chocolate sprinkles in a sugar cone. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=139.028s">I</a> pretty much get that every single time we're there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=140.969s">And</a> sometimes I had a sandwich, but it's pretty, you know, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=146.282s">If</a> you're sad, you go to Colleen's for ice cream. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=148.41s">If</a> you're happy, you go to celebrate at Colleen's for ice cream. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=153.299s">And</a> so that would be my favorite. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=155.74s">And</a> it doesn't hurt that you get to play games while you're there.
 <p>[Jessica Parks]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=165.864s">The</a> gumball machine is a definite draw there.
 <p>[Jessica Parks]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=182.35s">That's</a> awesome. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=182.97s">I</a> didn't realize that they didn't have that option as someone who has a family that eats way too many hot dogs.
 <p>[Jessica Parks]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=206.465s">I'd</a> say if you asked me about a year ago, if I would have run, I probably would have thought you were crazy. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=215.653s">But</a> as someone who is very much scared of the spotlight or anything to do with public speaking, but having worked on the override, the Invest in Medford campaign, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=233.229s">And</a> really, with my background, I have a master's in urban planning, and I haven't really truly, you know, used my master's degree as much as I would like to lately. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=249.794s">And</a> the urban planning community development aspect of it, I have been missing a lot lately. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=255.695s">And</a> so I think that the Invest in Medford campaign definitely tapped into it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=260.177s">And</a> then the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=261.856s">canvassing</a> really further drew me in. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=267.437s">Getting</a> out there and talking to so many different residents and hearing everyone's thoughts on the schools about what could be better, what we're doing good. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=276.5s">It</a> was truly eye-opening to me, a lot of things. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=281.581s">I</a> mean, I definitely had a lot of views of my own about how the schools were doing, but hearing some of those views <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=291.134s">substantiated,</a> but also so many other things from the residents throughout the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=299.68s">It</a> really drew me in and made me start to dig in more and more. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=303.963s">And</a> then that coupled with work on an afterschool task force, it kind of just led to this moment where I said, well, it's either I stop here or I <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=320.932s">jump</a> all the way in and just see what happens. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=324.175s">And</a> I decided to jump all the way in. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=326.277s">I</a> just, I felt compelled that I had more to do and more to give to the city.
 <p>[Jessica Parks]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=381.399s">I</a> think some of the top things, so one of the top things I heard about during canvassing, which <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=392.556s">was</a> not an issue that I faced. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=394.717s">And</a> I almost felt like it was a dirty word. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=397.218s">And</a> I hated to admit it was the afterschool program problem in the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=403.3s">It's</a> a massive problem. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=405.681s">And</a> we managed to get off the wait list after when my son was in first grade. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=412.724s">But</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=417.497s">It's</a> a massive problem. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=419.098s">We</a> don't have enough after school and there are other programs, but they're not quite fitting the need. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=426.362s">Some</a> end earlier than parents need them to. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=430.784s">Some</a> aren't 5 days a week. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=433.726s">And</a> so it's just a problem. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=436.587s">And</a> so I think that that that's 1 area. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=439.449s">And.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=442.781s">I</a> can kind of talk more about work that's been done on that in a little bit. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=446.005s">I</a> think another area that I really want to focus on is something that is really what's near and dear to my heart is making sure that all of our students get what they need and basically meeting students where they are. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=461.458s">And</a> that's thinking about, you know, our students who are operating below grade level at grade level and above grade level. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=468.983s">I</a> think we're losing a lot of students out of the district who are struggling to access the curriculum and. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=477.118s">and</a> on all ends of the spectrum. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=479.68s">And</a> that is because, I mean, it's a resource issue, obviously funding is necessary, but I think it's also a professional development issue and just identifying needs of different students. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=497.963s">and</a> making sure we understand what each student needs to be able to make that student successful. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=503.968s">So</a> I think there's a lot of pieces that we need to figure out how to put them all together in order to make sure that all of our students are thriving. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=513.155s">Because</a> no matter what, you will always have different students in the classroom. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=518.6s">All</a> of them will have individual needs, but <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=522.529s">And</a> teachers know how to work with that for the most part. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=527.751s">But</a> I think that there are certain students who just need a little bit more. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=535.333s">Whether</a> it's the child who's operating above grade level finishes their work quickly and is now sitting on a Chromebook for a good portion of the class goofing around. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=545.216s">Or</a> it's the child who can't access the curriculum because they still can't read. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=552.397s">and</a> keep falling behind and falling behind despite interventions. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=557.34s">And</a> we're still not quite figuring out how to work with them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=564.724s">And</a> I think that we need to really focus in on building up our ability to work with each child. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=573.73s">I</a> know our IEP program is convoluted at best. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=581.519s">We</a> went through the IEP process and it's convoluted. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=590.904s">It's</a> based on kind of a numbers game. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=594.066s">And</a> even if you see your child struggling and yet they don't fall within a number, they don't qualify. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=604.711s">So</a> it's a really hard problem to solve. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=612.276s">don't</a> pretend that I have an answer at this time, but I do think it's something worth exploring and looking at what other locations are doing and how are other people and other school districts dealing with this issue? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=627.12s">And</a> are they being more successful than we are? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=629.66s">And</a> can we learn from them? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=631.481s">And</a> that's kind of how I approach all issues is what can we take from other places? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=637.122s">Not</a> to say that we're doing it poorly, but just to say, can we learn something new?
 <p>[Jessica Parks]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=687.76s">I</a> mean, I'd say that's probably one of my highest priorities, which has its own tangled web, obviously working through the afterschool one. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=698.207s">And</a> that's something that I've worked to start currently, and I'm working as part of. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=703.871s">And</a> that's where we kind of look to other communities already. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=709.235s">When</a> I worked with a few other amazing <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=714.387s">Parents</a> to start the after school task force, we kind of came to it from this approach called. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=720.434s">You</a> know, lots of people had said, oh. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=724.259s">You</a> know, some reveal a Cambridge or this other location. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=728.724s">They're</a> not dealing with the same after school problem. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=731.026s">They</a> everybody can get after school there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=733.309s">I've</a> heard. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=734.379s">And</a> so, you know, I thought about it and I said, is that actually true or is this like Facebook myth, you know, urban legend? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=743.721s">And</a> so one of the things I pushed for is let's do case studies of these locations. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=749.762s">Let's</a> find out A, how many people do have afterschool that need it? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=754.822s">And</a> then B, how are they providing it? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=757.043s">What</a> are they doing differently that's allowing this to happen? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=760.303s">Because</a> obviously they can't, you know, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=765.328s">are</a> they doing something so drastically different that's allowing them to provide this much more? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=770.032s">And</a> what we did learn is no, not every child in these, you know, we looked at five different locations and not every child has afterschool in them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=779.82s">They're</a> not meeting 100% of the needs, but they are meeting substantially more of the needs than we are in Medford currently. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=788.3s">Um,</a> and they're doing it in 2 different ways. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=790.582s">Some</a> are privatizing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=792.163s">They're</a> after school and some are doing it in house through the district. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=798.008s">But</a> what they are doing is kind of. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=800.791s">Looking</a> at creative ways to pay staff, they're looking at creative use of. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=807.737s">Spaces</a> there, you know. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=810.941s">increasing</a> their numbers. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=813.384s">So</a> there are different kind of models that they're using. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=816.087s">And</a> we put together a massive spreadsheet and brought it before the district and said, here, here's a ton of information. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=823.415s">We've</a> kind of boiled it down to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=825.917s">just</a> the core elements that we're not doing in Medford that we think could help increase numbers. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=833.22s">And</a> these are kind of our recommendations. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=835.801s">And</a> that's the biggest way that I approach issues is, you know, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=844.125s">give</a> me a problem and instead of just kind of sitting and talking about it, I'll just explore all of the possibilities and boil it down and say, okay, let's now look at what's in front of us. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=856.907s">What</a> is the best approach? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=858.628s">And</a> bring in voices who are gonna be impacted by it rather than pretend I know what's best for anyone. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=866.229s">I'm</a> not, you know, I'm an urban planner with a specialty in environmental studies. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=874.331s">And</a> so I don't, and even then I wouldn't pretend to know what's best about urban planning. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=878.674s">Urban</a> planners are generalists who know how to look at information and bring in community members. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=885.979s">And</a> so I think that one of my strengths is just approaching things strategically and bringing in the right people to make decisions. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=897.507s">And</a> I think that when it comes to issues, I think that, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=901.65s">you</a> know, there are lots of issues that the school is facing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=904.492s">At</a> any one time, there's probably 100 fires that need to be put out. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=911.036s">But</a> identifying those fires <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=915.474s">That</a> is coming from the community. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=918.518s">That's</a> coming from the mom I talked to the other day that may need to send their child to the Carroll School because they are struggling with reading. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=930.892s">That</a> comes from the other <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=936.343s">father</a> who can't get off of the waitlist for afterschool and they have yet to get into any of the other external programs and are literally on a waitlist for every single afterschool program in the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=950.648s">That</a> comes from, you know, the parents of someone who <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=956.178s">you</a> know, are trying to figure out how to get their child safely from their house over to the middle school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=964.139s">Because</a> while we have the new Clippership Connector, there are still multiple points where their child has to cross the street that aren't necessarily the safest crossing points. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=976.481s">And</a> so that's where I feel like the biggest discussion, you know, the biggest issues are raised are by talking to people in the community and then trying to figure out solutions.
 <p>[Jessica Parks]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1009.545s">There</a> has been some small progress. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1012.468s">I</a> think 55, maybe a few more spaces have been opened up. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1019.554s">The</a> afterschool program has started offering a early pickup because what they realized is there are a number of students that only need afterschool for a small portion of time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1033.725s">Maybe</a> they have parents that are teachers <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1038.023s">who</a> just need that, you know, an hour extra to get to their child. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1043.745s">Like</a> they're finishing up their school day and then they need to get over to pick up their child at school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1050.047s">And</a> so, and there's also a group of staff that are willing to, you know, a certain amount of time longer, but not until 6 p.m. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1063.125s">because</a> staffing after school is also problematic. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1066.087s">So</a> it's easier to say, hey, can you staff until maybe 430 rather than six. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1073.831s">So</a> you pick up those extra staff and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1077.006s">you</a> kind of carve out those students who don't need coverage till six. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1082.03s">And</a> so that they were able to connect and create more spaces. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1087.135s">So</a> that's been great. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1088.296s">And</a> they're bringing in a private program that actually operates in Belmont to serve as a consultant, to help kind of basically analyze our program and see where we can make changes. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1103.488s">And</a> how do we create a after-school program that serves all Medford students? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1111.634s">And</a> when I say all Medford students, I don't necessarily mean open up a spot for every single student, because that's not necessarily possible. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1122.061s">But</a> I mean all of our students from a kind of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1125.844s">equity</a> and accessibility standpoint, but also that serves all Medford students and does so in a way that we are getting the most spaces in each of our schools. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1144.401s">So</a> we're not kind of leaving spaces on the table that could be out there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1149.65s">and</a> helping us look at ways that we can increase staffing and attract more staff and things like that.
 <p>[Jessica Parks]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1178.235s">And</a> I think also that will come with working with the principals and the teachers. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1183.897s">And</a> I don't want to forget them in this process. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1186.358s">I</a> talked a lot about talking to the residents, but I do think we also need to make sure when we're figuring out issues with the school or what's working in the schools, we need to be talking with the teachers. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1198.163s">We</a> need to be talking with the principals, the staff, everyone in the schools. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1202.704s">You</a> know, one of the things I think <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1204.794s">You</a> know, if I'm elected, I would wanna be doing regular coffee hours and getting to each school and finding out what's working in the schools. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1214.822s">And</a> so setting that up for the teachers to be able to like meet them on their terms and say, hey, tell me, you know, what's working, what's not working, what do you need? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1225.731s">You</a> know, in an ideal world, what would you have? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1229.735s">You</a> know, I know there's lots of things that they would have in an ideal world, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1234.577s">Or,</a> you know, in a resources constricted ideal world, what would help you, you know, and things like that, like tiers of.
 <p>[Jessica Parks]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1255.722s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1256.823s">And</a> you see it all the time is how teachers are making it work right now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1261.966s">You</a> know, limited resources and they're making things work. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1265.768s">And</a> it's commendable, but it's not sustainable. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1269.37s">Yeah,</a> true.
 <p>[Jessica Parks]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1280.437s">I</a> mean, I think it's been a common thread, but I think communication is also important to me. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1286.049s">I</a> think that making sure that we are communicating throughout, whether it's administration to parents, parents to administration, that, you know, you hear all the time about 500 emails going to administration on the same topic because something happens. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1309.068s">you</a> know, whether it's a change of a teacher or something isn't communicated well, and then parents are sending emails to administration, those 500 emails are emails that need to then be read and responded to, which take time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1327.572s">And</a> that shouldn't have to happen. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1329.693s">And,</a> you know, that's someone's, that's time away from someone's actual job. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1336.783s">And</a> I feel that if we can be communicating proactively, and we can be having conversations regularly, and we can basically be doing everything possible. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1349.586s">I</a> mean, it's not always possible. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1354.587s">I'm</a> a realist. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1355.467s">I</a> recognize it's not always possible. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1358.108s">But</a> if we can be doing as much as we can and having regular check-ins or regular updates about <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1366.251s">things</a> that we know would potentially cause those 500 emails to come flying, then we can allow conversations to happen before they become issues. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1383.315s">And</a> I think that's a critical thing, is allow the dialogue to happen before it becomes an issue. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1391.35s">An</a> issue, because once it becomes an issue, the dialogue is no longer able to happen in any sort of constructive manner. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1403.521s">And</a> I think that's what's needed is whether it's websites that are routinely being updated that provide more detailed information or emails that are going out more regularly, things like that.
 <p>[Jessica Parks]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1442.515s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1443.576s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1443.956s">I</a> mean, it is. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1445.257s">And</a> there's disjointed ways to get information. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1447.359s">I</a> think if it's, you know, you need to kind of establish baselines. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1451.603s">And</a> then from there, you kind of establish expectations, like these types of items will be communicated, whether it's via a newsletter that comes out weekly, whether it's, you know, an email that goes out, you know, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1468.064s">every</a> other week and a weekly newsletter, you know, and he's kind of give tears and this is how it's communicated. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1474.168s">So</a> it's just establishing expectations and making sure that everyone's on board with them.
 <p>[Jessica Parks]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1495.842s">Email</a> me. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1498.844s">Email</a> me, I will also, which I think I'm gonna provide you my email address. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1504.827s">My</a> website, I will be at Colleen's for a meet and greet on the, well, September 3rd. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1516.553s">I</a> also have another meet and greet on September 4th, which will also, all of these are on my website. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1524.697s">And</a> then I will be on October 3rd <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1528.825s">at</a> the Great American Beer Hall as well for a meet and greet. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1535.008s">And</a> I will be canvassing every weekend from now until election. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1541.452s">So</a> hopefully I will knock on your door and be able to chat with you then as well. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1546.239s">That</a> is probably my favorite way to talk to you.
 <p>[Jessica Parks]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1568.997s">No,</a> I mean, I think the one, maybe <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1576.318s">One</a> thing that, you know, I'm always happy to meet with anyone. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1584.38s">This</a> one-on-one is probably what I enjoy the best. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1589.381s">But</a> I also think, you know, one of the other things that really spurred me to get involved is truly my kiddo. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1601.579s">you</a> know, and I do this for him as well as, you know, many other kiddos in this city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1609.163s">And</a> that's truly what is driving me for, you know, right now and through this election. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1616.347s">And</a> so that's kind of where I'm coming from and truly making it that much more personal to me, so.
 <p>[Jessica Parks]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1627.067s">Yeah,</a> as he sits behind me.
 <p>[Jessica Parks]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1651.276s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1651.876s">And</a> in this climate as well, I think it's important to show them that it's, it's important to stand up for what you believe in, you know, no matter how hard it is, no matter what it takes, you know, it just, it's important. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1666.643s">Well,</a> thank you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1667.443s">Yeah.</a>

 <p>[Jessica Parks]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=709.059s">Another</a> thing that I heard in those comments, which is tied into the inequity piece, I think somewhat, but just the reality of what happens if they don't pass is, I think one of the people said that they could potentially leave Medford if they don't pass. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=732.884s">And</a> that's troublesome. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=735.245s">We've</a> been here for, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=738.047s">13</a> years, we're not going anywhere. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=741.048s">The</a> cost of houses in this area are ridiculous. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=748.21s">So</a> we're not moving anywhere. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=750.231s">We're</a> not in a position to move anywhere else. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=753.952s">And</a> if it doesn't pass, then is it that people who can move elsewhere to other districts where they're investing in their children, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=764.315s">then</a> those children have the opportunities. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=766.456s">Or</a> people who can't afford to have their children go to private schools, their children get those opportunities. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=771.979s">And</a> then the children left in the Medford schools are left with what the Medford schools end up becoming. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5ljTZzTyG6gvoBiZnz0xTt?t=780.022s">And</a> so that worries me personally for my own kid and all the other kids who will be left in the Medford school district if it doesn't pass.
