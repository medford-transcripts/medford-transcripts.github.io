    <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2838.597s">[Jessica Parks]</a>: Jessica Parks, 38 Corey Street, and I just want to reiterate what they've said, and thank you for coming in and.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2846.201s">[Jessica Parks]</a>: know, immediately jumping in in your first few months on the job and taking this on with the urgency that it needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2852.486s">[Jessica Parks]</a>: But also, one of the things I learned looking at other districts is needing to look at it creatively, and thinking that outside of the box to figure out how to get more children into our schools and aftercare.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2867.136s">[Jessica Parks]</a>: So I appreciate how you've kind of strategically looked at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2871.259s">[Jessica Parks]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2872.138s">[Jessica Parks]</a>: I just want to thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2873.399s">[Jessica Parks]</a>: And I also want to reiterate the need for kind of clear communication as we move forward on a maybe more regular basis, just so families know what to expect and when to expect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2886.068s">[Jessica Parks]</a>: That's what I want to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2887.609s">[Jessica Parks]</a>: But I really do want to say thank you, because I think that it was, as you've heard, it's a really big concern in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2897.436s">[Jessica Parks]</a>: And I just really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2898.737s">[Jessica Parks]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8773.457s">[Jessica Parks]</a>: Jessica Parks, 38 Corey Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8776.699s">[Jessica Parks]</a>: I just want to thank you all for doing this and for also working so hard to take into consideration all of the feedback you've received to date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8786.266s">[Jessica Parks]</a>: During the override campaign, there was a recognition from both proponents and opponents of the override that the override was a stopgap for immediate needs, but the city ultimately needed to focus on new growth to thrive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8802.408s">[Jessica Parks]</a>: The citywide zoning plan is a critical first step in doing this to bring in higher density and mixed use development that in a way that is responsible and not done in a haphazard or ad hoc way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8817.355s">[Jessica Parks]</a>: And I think that just the back and forth that has occurred to date really shows that we need to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8826.756s">[Jessica Parks]</a>: the city is taking this seriously and trying to listen to the concerns of residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8833.298s">[Jessica Parks]</a>: Obviously not everyone is going to be 100% happy, but I think that in order for us to bring in the much needed development for a stronger financial base for the city, we do need to bring in development and make it easier for developers to do such.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8851.102s">[Jessica Parks]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>
