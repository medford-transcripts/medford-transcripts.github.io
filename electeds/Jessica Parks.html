<h2><a href="../2025-09-08_XXXXXX00137/2025-09-08_XXXXXX00137.html">Jessica Parks, Candidate for School Committee</a></h2>
 <p>[Jessica Parks]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=53.416s">Thanks,</a> Danielle. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=54.576s">Jessica</a> Parks, she, her, I am. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=60.483s">Running</a> for school committee currently. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=63.425s">I</a> am a mom to a new fifth grader. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=68.388s">I</a> lived in Medford for almost 14 years now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=75.012s">I'm</a> a project manager for energy efficiency projects at MIT and have a background in urban planning. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=86.459s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=86.939s">Thanks</a> for having me.
 <p>[Jessica Parks]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=112.386s">Well,</a> I think there are a bunch of things. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=118.236s">I</a> like to eat around Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=120.557s">Definitely</a> the fried chicken sandwich at Deep Cuts and currently the seafood pie at Mrs. Murphy's. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=128.442s">But</a> my all time favorite place is always Colleen's and it's the peppermint stick ice cream with chocolate sprinkles in a sugar cone. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=139.028s">I</a> pretty much get that every single time we're there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=140.969s">And</a> sometimes I had a sandwich, but it's pretty, you know, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=146.282s">If</a> you're sad, you go to Colleen's for ice cream. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=148.41s">If</a> you're happy, you go to celebrate at Colleen's for ice cream. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=153.299s">And</a> so that would be my favorite. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=155.74s">And</a> it doesn't hurt that you get to play games while you're there.
 <p>[Jessica Parks]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=165.864s">The</a> gumball machine is a definite draw there.
 <p>[Jessica Parks]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=182.35s">That's</a> awesome. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=182.97s">I</a> didn't realize that they didn't have that option as someone who has a family that eats way too many hot dogs.
 <p>[Jessica Parks]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=206.465s">I'd</a> say if you asked me about a year ago, if I would have run, I probably would have thought you were crazy. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=215.653s">But</a> as someone who is very much scared of the spotlight or anything to do with public speaking, but having worked on the override, the Invest in Medford campaign, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=233.229s">And</a> really, with my background, I have a master's in urban planning, and I haven't really truly, you know, used my master's degree as much as I would like to lately. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=249.794s">And</a> the urban planning community development aspect of it, I have been missing a lot lately. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=255.695s">And</a> so I think that the Invest in Medford campaign definitely tapped into it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=260.177s">And</a> then the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=261.856s">canvassing</a> really further drew me in. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=267.437s">Getting</a> out there and talking to so many different residents and hearing everyone's thoughts on the schools about what could be better, what we're doing good. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=276.5s">It</a> was truly eye-opening to me, a lot of things. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=281.581s">I</a> mean, I definitely had a lot of views of my own about how the schools were doing, but hearing some of those views <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=291.134s">substantiated,</a> but also so many other things from the residents throughout the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=299.68s">It</a> really drew me in and made me start to dig in more and more. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=303.963s">And</a> then that coupled with work on an afterschool task force, it kind of just led to this moment where I said, well, it's either I stop here or I <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=320.932s">jump</a> all the way in and just see what happens. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=324.175s">And</a> I decided to jump all the way in. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=326.277s">I</a> just, I felt compelled that I had more to do and more to give to the city.
 <p>[Jessica Parks]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=381.399s">I</a> think some of the top things, so one of the top things I heard about during canvassing, which <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=392.556s">was</a> not an issue that I faced. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=394.717s">And</a> I almost felt like it was a dirty word. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=397.218s">And</a> I hated to admit it was the afterschool program problem in the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=403.3s">It's</a> a massive problem. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=405.681s">And</a> we managed to get off the wait list after when my son was in first grade. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=412.724s">But</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=417.497s">It's</a> a massive problem. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=419.098s">We</a> don't have enough after school and there are other programs, but they're not quite fitting the need. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=426.362s">Some</a> end earlier than parents need them to. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=430.784s">Some</a> aren't 5 days a week. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=433.726s">And</a> so it's just a problem. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=436.587s">And</a> so I think that that that's 1 area. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=439.449s">And.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=442.781s">I</a> can kind of talk more about work that's been done on that in a little bit. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=446.005s">I</a> think another area that I really want to focus on is something that is really what's near and dear to my heart is making sure that all of our students get what they need and basically meeting students where they are. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=461.458s">And</a> that's thinking about, you know, our students who are operating below grade level at grade level and above grade level. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=468.983s">I</a> think we're losing a lot of students out of the district who are struggling to access the curriculum and. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=477.118s">and</a> on all ends of the spectrum. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=479.68s">And</a> that is because, I mean, it's a resource issue, obviously funding is necessary, but I think it's also a professional development issue and just identifying needs of different students. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=497.963s">and</a> making sure we understand what each student needs to be able to make that student successful. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=503.968s">So</a> I think there's a lot of pieces that we need to figure out how to put them all together in order to make sure that all of our students are thriving. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=513.155s">Because</a> no matter what, you will always have different students in the classroom. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=518.6s">All</a> of them will have individual needs, but <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=522.529s">And</a> teachers know how to work with that for the most part. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=527.751s">But</a> I think that there are certain students who just need a little bit more. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=535.333s">Whether</a> it's the child who's operating above grade level finishes their work quickly and is now sitting on a Chromebook for a good portion of the class goofing around. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=545.216s">Or</a> it's the child who can't access the curriculum because they still can't read. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=552.397s">and</a> keep falling behind and falling behind despite interventions. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=557.34s">And</a> we're still not quite figuring out how to work with them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=564.724s">And</a> I think that we need to really focus in on building up our ability to work with each child. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=573.73s">I</a> know our IEP program is convoluted at best. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=581.519s">We</a> went through the IEP process and it's convoluted. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=590.904s">It's</a> based on kind of a numbers game. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=594.066s">And</a> even if you see your child struggling and yet they don't fall within a number, they don't qualify. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=604.711s">So</a> it's a really hard problem to solve. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=612.276s">don't</a> pretend that I have an answer at this time, but I do think it's something worth exploring and looking at what other locations are doing and how are other people and other school districts dealing with this issue? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=627.12s">And</a> are they being more successful than we are? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=629.66s">And</a> can we learn from them? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=631.481s">And</a> that's kind of how I approach all issues is what can we take from other places? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=637.122s">Not</a> to say that we're doing it poorly, but just to say, can we learn something new?
 <p>[Jessica Parks]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=687.76s">I</a> mean, I'd say that's probably one of my highest priorities, which has its own tangled web, obviously working through the afterschool one. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=698.207s">And</a> that's something that I've worked to start currently, and I'm working as part of. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=703.871s">And</a> that's where we kind of look to other communities already. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=709.235s">When</a> I worked with a few other amazing <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=714.387s">Parents</a> to start the after school task force, we kind of came to it from this approach called. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=720.434s">You</a> know, lots of people had said, oh. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=724.259s">You</a> know, some reveal a Cambridge or this other location. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=728.724s">They're</a> not dealing with the same after school problem. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=731.026s">They</a> everybody can get after school there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=733.309s">I've</a> heard. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=734.379s">And</a> so, you know, I thought about it and I said, is that actually true or is this like Facebook myth, you know, urban legend? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=743.721s">And</a> so one of the things I pushed for is let's do case studies of these locations. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=749.762s">Let's</a> find out A, how many people do have afterschool that need it? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=754.822s">And</a> then B, how are they providing it? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=757.043s">What</a> are they doing differently that's allowing this to happen? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=760.303s">Because</a> obviously they can't, you know, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=765.328s">are</a> they doing something so drastically different that's allowing them to provide this much more? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=770.032s">And</a> what we did learn is no, not every child in these, you know, we looked at five different locations and not every child has afterschool in them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=779.82s">They're</a> not meeting 100% of the needs, but they are meeting substantially more of the needs than we are in Medford currently. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=788.3s">Um,</a> and they're doing it in 2 different ways. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=790.582s">Some</a> are privatizing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=792.163s">They're</a> after school and some are doing it in house through the district. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=798.008s">But</a> what they are doing is kind of. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=800.791s">Looking</a> at creative ways to pay staff, they're looking at creative use of. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=807.737s">Spaces</a> there, you know. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=810.941s">increasing</a> their numbers. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=813.384s">So</a> there are different kind of models that they're using. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=816.087s">And</a> we put together a massive spreadsheet and brought it before the district and said, here, here's a ton of information. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=823.415s">We've</a> kind of boiled it down to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=825.917s">just</a> the core elements that we're not doing in Medford that we think could help increase numbers. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=833.22s">And</a> these are kind of our recommendations. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=835.801s">And</a> that's the biggest way that I approach issues is, you know, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=844.125s">give</a> me a problem and instead of just kind of sitting and talking about it, I'll just explore all of the possibilities and boil it down and say, okay, let's now look at what's in front of us. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=856.907s">What</a> is the best approach? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=858.628s">And</a> bring in voices who are gonna be impacted by it rather than pretend I know what's best for anyone. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=866.229s">I'm</a> not, you know, I'm an urban planner with a specialty in environmental studies. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=874.331s">And</a> so I don't, and even then I wouldn't pretend to know what's best about urban planning. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=878.674s">Urban</a> planners are generalists who know how to look at information and bring in community members. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=885.979s">And</a> so I think that one of my strengths is just approaching things strategically and bringing in the right people to make decisions. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=897.507s">And</a> I think that when it comes to issues, I think that, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=901.65s">you</a> know, there are lots of issues that the school is facing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=904.492s">At</a> any one time, there's probably 100 fires that need to be put out. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=911.036s">But</a> identifying those fires <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=915.474s">That</a> is coming from the community. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=918.518s">That's</a> coming from the mom I talked to the other day that may need to send their child to the Carroll School because they are struggling with reading. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=930.892s">That</a> comes from the other <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=936.343s">father</a> who can't get off of the waitlist for afterschool and they have yet to get into any of the other external programs and are literally on a waitlist for every single afterschool program in the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=950.648s">That</a> comes from, you know, the parents of someone who <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=956.178s">you</a> know, are trying to figure out how to get their child safely from their house over to the middle school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=964.139s">Because</a> while we have the new Clippership Connector, there are still multiple points where their child has to cross the street that aren't necessarily the safest crossing points. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=976.481s">And</a> so that's where I feel like the biggest discussion, you know, the biggest issues are raised are by talking to people in the community and then trying to figure out solutions.
 <p>[Jessica Parks]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1009.545s">There</a> has been some small progress. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1012.468s">I</a> think 55, maybe a few more spaces have been opened up. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1019.554s">The</a> afterschool program has started offering a early pickup because what they realized is there are a number of students that only need afterschool for a small portion of time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1033.725s">Maybe</a> they have parents that are teachers <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1038.023s">who</a> just need that, you know, an hour extra to get to their child. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1043.745s">Like</a> they're finishing up their school day and then they need to get over to pick up their child at school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1050.047s">And</a> so, and there's also a group of staff that are willing to, you know, a certain amount of time longer, but not until 6 p.m. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1063.125s">because</a> staffing after school is also problematic. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1066.087s">So</a> it's easier to say, hey, can you staff until maybe 430 rather than six. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1073.831s">So</a> you pick up those extra staff and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1077.006s">you</a> kind of carve out those students who don't need coverage till six. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1082.03s">And</a> so that they were able to connect and create more spaces. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1087.135s">So</a> that's been great. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1088.296s">And</a> they're bringing in a private program that actually operates in Belmont to serve as a consultant, to help kind of basically analyze our program and see where we can make changes. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1103.488s">And</a> how do we create a after-school program that serves all Medford students? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1111.634s">And</a> when I say all Medford students, I don't necessarily mean open up a spot for every single student, because that's not necessarily possible. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1122.061s">But</a> I mean all of our students from a kind of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1125.844s">equity</a> and accessibility standpoint, but also that serves all Medford students and does so in a way that we are getting the most spaces in each of our schools. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1144.401s">So</a> we're not kind of leaving spaces on the table that could be out there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1149.65s">and</a> helping us look at ways that we can increase staffing and attract more staff and things like that.
 <p>[Jessica Parks]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1178.235s">And</a> I think also that will come with working with the principals and the teachers. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1183.897s">And</a> I don't want to forget them in this process. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1186.358s">I</a> talked a lot about talking to the residents, but I do think we also need to make sure when we're figuring out issues with the school or what's working in the schools, we need to be talking with the teachers. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1198.163s">We</a> need to be talking with the principals, the staff, everyone in the schools. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1202.704s">You</a> know, one of the things I think <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1204.794s">You</a> know, if I'm elected, I would wanna be doing regular coffee hours and getting to each school and finding out what's working in the schools. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1214.822s">And</a> so setting that up for the teachers to be able to like meet them on their terms and say, hey, tell me, you know, what's working, what's not working, what do you need? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1225.731s">You</a> know, in an ideal world, what would you have? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1229.735s">You</a> know, I know there's lots of things that they would have in an ideal world, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1234.577s">Or,</a> you know, in a resources constricted ideal world, what would help you, you know, and things like that, like tiers of.
 <p>[Jessica Parks]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1255.722s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1256.823s">And</a> you see it all the time is how teachers are making it work right now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1261.966s">You</a> know, limited resources and they're making things work. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1265.768s">And</a> it's commendable, but it's not sustainable. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1269.37s">Yeah,</a> true.
 <p>[Jessica Parks]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1280.437s">I</a> mean, I think it's been a common thread, but I think communication is also important to me. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1286.049s">I</a> think that making sure that we are communicating throughout, whether it's administration to parents, parents to administration, that, you know, you hear all the time about 500 emails going to administration on the same topic because something happens. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1309.068s">you</a> know, whether it's a change of a teacher or something isn't communicated well, and then parents are sending emails to administration, those 500 emails are emails that need to then be read and responded to, which take time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1327.572s">And</a> that shouldn't have to happen. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1329.693s">And,</a> you know, that's someone's, that's time away from someone's actual job. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1336.783s">And</a> I feel that if we can be communicating proactively, and we can be having conversations regularly, and we can basically be doing everything possible. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1349.586s">I</a> mean, it's not always possible. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1354.587s">I'm</a> a realist. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1355.467s">I</a> recognize it's not always possible. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1358.108s">But</a> if we can be doing as much as we can and having regular check-ins or regular updates about <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1366.251s">things</a> that we know would potentially cause those 500 emails to come flying, then we can allow conversations to happen before they become issues. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1383.315s">And</a> I think that's a critical thing, is allow the dialogue to happen before it becomes an issue. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1391.35s">An</a> issue, because once it becomes an issue, the dialogue is no longer able to happen in any sort of constructive manner. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1403.521s">And</a> I think that's what's needed is whether it's websites that are routinely being updated that provide more detailed information or emails that are going out more regularly, things like that.
 <p>[Jessica Parks]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1442.515s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1443.576s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1443.956s">I</a> mean, it is. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1445.257s">And</a> there's disjointed ways to get information. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1447.359s">I</a> think if it's, you know, you need to kind of establish baselines. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1451.603s">And</a> then from there, you kind of establish expectations, like these types of items will be communicated, whether it's via a newsletter that comes out weekly, whether it's, you know, an email that goes out, you know, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1468.064s">every</a> other week and a weekly newsletter, you know, and he's kind of give tears and this is how it's communicated. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EhMvY6NLSg06tdeHG3gBh?t=1474.168s">So</a> it's just establishing expectations and making sure that everyone's on board with them.

 <p>[Jessica Parks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8773.457s">Jessica</a> Parks, 38 Corey Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8776.699s">I</a> just want to thank you all for doing this and for also working so hard to take into consideration all of the feedback you've received to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8786.266s">During</a> the override campaign, there was a recognition from both proponents and opponents of the override that the override was a stopgap for immediate needs, but the city ultimately needed to focus on new growth to thrive. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8802.408s">The</a> citywide zoning plan is a critical first step in doing this to bring in higher density and mixed use development that in a way that is responsible and not done in a haphazard or ad hoc way. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8817.355s">And</a> I think that just the back and forth that has occurred to date really shows that we need to <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8826.756s">the</a> city is taking this seriously and trying to listen to the concerns of residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8833.298s">Obviously</a> not everyone is going to be 100% happy, but I think that in order for us to bring in the much needed development for a stronger financial base for the city, we do need to bring in development and make it easier for developers to do such. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8851.102s">Thank</a> you.
