 <p>[Jessica Parks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2838.597s">Jessica</a> Parks, 38 Corey Street, and I just want to reiterate what they've said, and thank you for coming in and. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2846.201s">know,</a> immediately jumping in in your first few months on the job and taking this on with the urgency that it needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2852.486s">But</a> also, one of the things I learned looking at other districts is needing to look at it creatively, and thinking that outside of the box to figure out how to get more children into our schools and aftercare. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2867.136s">So</a> I appreciate how you've kind of strategically looked at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2871.259s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2872.138s">I</a> just want to thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2873.399s">And</a> I also want to reiterate the need for kind of clear communication as we move forward on a maybe more regular basis, just so families know what to expect and when to expect. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2886.068s">That's</a> what I want to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2887.609s">But</a> I really do want to say thank you, because I think that it was, as you've heard, it's a really big concern in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2897.436s">And</a> I just really appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SGdnUuDa2t4&t=2898.737s">So</a> thank you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-12_llQSZsu-6bs/2025-03-12_llQSZsu-6bs.html">City Council 03-11-25</a></h2>
 <p>[Jessica Parks]: <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8773.457s">Jessica</a> Parks, 38 Corey Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8776.699s">I</a> just want to thank you all for doing this and for also working so hard to take into consideration all of the feedback you've received to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8786.266s">During</a> the override campaign, there was a recognition from both proponents and opponents of the override that the override was a stopgap for immediate needs, but the city ultimately needed to focus on new growth to thrive. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8802.408s">The</a> citywide zoning plan is a critical first step in doing this to bring in higher density and mixed use development that in a way that is responsible and not done in a haphazard or ad hoc way. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8817.355s">And</a> I think that just the back and forth that has occurred to date really shows that we need to <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8826.756s">the</a> city is taking this seriously and trying to listen to the concerns of residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8833.298s">Obviously</a> not everyone is going to be 100% happy, but I think that in order for us to bring in the much needed development for a stronger financial base for the city, we do need to bring in development and make it easier for developers to do such. <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=8851.102s">Thank</a> you.
