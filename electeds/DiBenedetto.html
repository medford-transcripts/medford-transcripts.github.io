    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6237.342s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Hi, Erin DiBenedetto, 21 Dearborn street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6239.723s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Uh, I live in the Hillside and the number of rats in the area has grown tremendously, especially this summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6248.323s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I personally called the health department less than a week ago and they're extremely helpful and very receptive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6255.285s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think accountability has to come in play.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6257.666s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think people aren't taking care of the weeds in their lawns and they hibernate in the ground and they make holes in the ground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6265.808s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So people think, and they live near food sources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6269.43s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So gardens, fruit trees, those types of things, and they need water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6274.051s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So they're gonna live near those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6278.416s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: My question is, if you do create this commission or whatever, would you go to different areas of the city and speak on this issue in a community way?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6291.145s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Like, go up to Hillside, gather the people there, go to the South Methodist Fire Station, have a meeting there, go to the community and educate them in that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6302.412s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It has to be hands-on, and if you really<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6306.034s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: communicate to them, you're there in their area to help them and hear their concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6311.001s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think that going out to the community rather than just robo calls and on the online, and you really see the people that you are representing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6321.997s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: face-to-face in that they see how much you care about this issue, they'll all work together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6327.219s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They'll talk about, I mean, I have no problem ratting someone else for not taking care of their property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6333.662s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And that's how I feel because I am afraid of rodents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6337.464s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And that owner, and if they're renting, I'm like, you're collecting the rent, pay someone to do it if you can't do it yourself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6345.407s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: If you're elderly, get some help, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6348.953s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: but don't leave it so the rest of us have to live with rats.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6352.795s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6353.676s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So the community piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6354.997s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The other piece is, Walkling Court is scheduled for demolition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6362.081s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Is there a plan in place for the hillside area on rodents?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6369.325s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Is that part of that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6370.726s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: How much money is allocated to that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6373.148s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: What are we doing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6373.988s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: What are we pre-planning?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6374.869s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because I live in that neighborhood and I haven't heard anything about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6379.511s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know they'll reach out to the media community about like 400 feet from the building, but what about the rest of us that live in that area?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6387.357s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We need notification and we need notification about how, what they're doing to mitigate that before it happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6393.141s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Cause everybody who's talking about it, I'm worried when that happens, just like the green line, which I walked by yesterday and I read this big, walked in front of me at 5.20 in the afternoon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6406.414s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I won't walk after seven o'clock because the rats come out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6410.295s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's pretty bad when it's still sunny and they're walking in front of me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6414.617s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'm just, I'm really grateful that this is being addressed and I'm<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6425.452s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6426.372s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: My time must be up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6466.326s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6466.646s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6467.327s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GOUOtu3l1ks&t=2092.711s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: just happy that we're not moving for two and that we're able to maintain that location at Wakling Court for the primary election coming up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6994.632s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Hi, Aaron Benedetto 21 Dearborn Street, so I know they are very well that's my word.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7001.74s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Really City Hall is our best location based on availability of parking ADA compliance<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7009.369s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: and just generally available for all people to come and vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7014.83s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know it's a little further than some of the other places you have, but we have vetted those places and they are not as accommodating as we need either for the reasons I stated before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=198.971s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=308.845s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Dr. Cushing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=428.451s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Next slide, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=652.751s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Can you go back one please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=656.573s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=813.406s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Next slide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=925.274s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Dr. Cushing, next slide, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=927.09s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=1053.566s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Dr. Cushing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=1058.371s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So our FY 24 budgetary priorities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bPsPwj5vBSI&t=3661.939s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=453.279s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=498.65s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=1431.101s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=1540.495s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=1541.796s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=1954.756s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=1956.578s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes, Member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=2192.472s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=2592.888s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, but so there'll be no form that sort of standard for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=2595.829s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's that if there's a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=2783.571s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Remember Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=3153.474s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Dr. Cushing, and then Member Hays, and then Member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=4028.014s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=4031.156s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=4132.73s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=4134.911s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=4135.091s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Bradley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=4135.251s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=4223.042s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Would that be a separate one altogether?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=4226.784s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Just curious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=4231.647s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I can never figure out how to turn it on either, so I get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=4525.462s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: 30 to 45 days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=4596.328s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=7637.131s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=7637.872s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=7638.272s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: All those opposed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jIaWTlmnQkA&t=7638.973s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2630.04s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You're unmuted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2631.822s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I was trying to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2632.743s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It wasn't allowing me and then they asked me not to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2634.984s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But anyway, Erin DiBenedetto, 21<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2636.726s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Hamlin St.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2638.307s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: First of all, I'm all for putting more of the energy through their power system as long as it's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2647.341s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: quiet, and it has been for quite a bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2654.007s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I also need to comment that the construction that's going on up across right now, they're not being neat with keeping things off the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2663.616s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Even tonight as I walked by, there was piles of sand and rock in the street with cones wrapped around it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2672.293s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: and some trash bags behind a barrier that really doesn't, that barrier doesn't need to be there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2678.876s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I've called a couple of city Councilors and Vice President Rick Caraviello has been very helpful in getting them to clear that area so the street stays wide and safe for both pedestrians and cars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2699.545s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It goes to speak as just when they're doing the Boston Ave project, I hope that they keep that area safe and clean as they do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2708.135s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's a great improvement for their community, but while they're building, they need to be aware of the hillside community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2715.16s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Also, I would like to be re-added to the emails that Rocco mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2720.383s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just want to be clear that not all- What information, Mr. President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2748.902s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, I respect that Councilor Knight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2751.885s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just wanted to make sure that the project is safe for the residents as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2756.169s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So yes, I'm in favor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4425.779s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you, President Flanagan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4427.74s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Erin DiBenedetto, 21 Dearborn Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4430.02s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I agree wholeheartedly with the addition of Tufts filing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4435.082s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We don't know in our neighborhood what is happening and what construction is happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4440.024s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And if the city council is where I go to when I ask those questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4445.666s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So it would be really nice if you had that information as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4449.567s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'm hoping that the council or one of the councilors will amend the amendment to include Tufts University.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2640.654s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Looking for my report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2647.402s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2649.445s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It was right in front of me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2652.135s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So we had our first meeting of the year for the special education subcommittee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2659.076s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We had many administrators present, Diane Caldwell, Joan Bowen, Toni Wray, Paulette VanDeKoop, my associates, Paul Rousseau, Jenny Graham, the school committee elect member, Jenny Graham, Neil Osborne, Emily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2678.393s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Lazzaro, Lisa Kingsley from the Curtis Huff School, Melanie McLaughlin who will also take office soon as a school committee member, Tonya and Alex Lurie, Tonya Solomon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2691.1s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So we had this meeting to go over what we accomplished last year and we had set forth two goals last year and we made tremendous amount of work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2701.165s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And the first goal for the community was raising disability awareness training and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2709.818s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And just helping our summer out of school time activities for our students with special needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2716.284s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Before school, after school, summer camp, vacation camps, and we did a lot of work, especially Diane Caldwell, on new handbooks, more parent friendly,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2730.805s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: and to make it friendly for families that have students with needs to come forward so we know ahead of time and can plan for those students' needs and be ready for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2743.254s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And we also try to get parents to enroll earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2747.938s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So we have staffing and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2751.422s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: we're set up appropriately for all of our students in the summer program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2755.966s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So, look forward to that in the spring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2758.789s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Registration will be going out earlier this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2762.873s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So, and together we wanted to raise awareness and especially like in curriculum and use examples of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2773.263s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: challenging situations that students could have more empathy and more inclusion of all students' needs in the classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2783.454s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And Shelly Gross ran some programming for our teachers and it was a great hit and more of that is going to continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2790.16s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So those goals are going to continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2792.122s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And we talked about what goals we'd set forth for the next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2798.084s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And since I won't be chairing the committee, no decisions were made on those goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2802.366s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And we felt like the new chairperson would bring those goals forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2808.529s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But we did identify some areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2811.331s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Looking at special education curriculum, what's being taught and how it's being taught was one idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2817.634s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And community hosting accessible recreation programs was another idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2829.022s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Increasing the programming at the Curtis Huff School was an idea, and focusing on students with disability in our upper grades, because sometimes we focus a lot on the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2840.032s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: lower grades in teaching students to self-advocate at those grade levels, and maybe a unified sports program similar to the one that they have in Malden.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2852.084s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And to get Medford more involved with the Challenger event that Malden is very involved in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2859.771s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know that a lot of us went to Challenger Day, and I'd love to see a larger participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2865.621s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And some of these aren't year-long goals, but they're quick hits that we can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2869.625s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And whoever runs this committee, I think hopefully some of my colleagues that have been serving on it will continue at least one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2881.718s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So there's some history brought forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2884.0s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But it's been a great committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2887.215s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The keeping the goals to one or two, possibly three, is very important in my mind because you can see effective change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2896.304s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You can really work on issues and dig in on them and make a difference in children's lives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2902.17s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: If you have 20 goals, it's very hard to meet all of those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2905.994s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that's our committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2910.603s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's been a great honor to be the chairperson of that committee, and I'm glad that the mayor established that and that we are serving our students in that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2919.609s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2920.069s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2920.129s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4152.145s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4153.086s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: First of all, I pushed strong and hard for this last year, and I really wanted breakfast before the bell, but I want to stop and appreciate all the work that you've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4164.065s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: on this program, it's tremendous to see the increase in high school students eating breakfast is huge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4172.348s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: These numbers are wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4174.529s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You have fed, we have as a community have fed many more children breakfast this year and it's because of the work of many in our district and it's greatly appreciated, 100%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4189.023s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I still see a big difference of schools that have breakfast after the bell than before the bell, so I'm gonna ask you to look at that for next year, but I am wholeheartedly in agreement that we should continue this program, and any way we can feed children throughout our district, just keep bringing it in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4209.331s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Keep doing what you're doing, and thank you again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4213.373s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4214.553s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5086.103s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5156.54s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just want to say thank you to my family for giving up time with me to give me time to serve this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5164.763s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Service is a big part of our family life and I'm blessed to have served Method.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5170.065s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=823.628s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2323.45s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2324.794s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2325.014s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: DiBenedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2326.014s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2327.035s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: To follow up about South Street, can we make sure that an auto call is sent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2332.696s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So especially with how cold it's been, we don't want to accidentally have any children waiting out there for the bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2340.799s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We can definitely do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2343.06s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And just maybe to everyone, because kids might take a bus home to that area to walk to a grandparent's or a caregiver's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2354.859s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: House, not just the kids that necessarily are living right in that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2368.83s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Definitely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2369.531s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And just, I don't know if we're gonna discuss it now, but there has been some emails and letters of concerns of bus crowding, but we can wait till further in this meeting, but especially middle school buses being overcrowded at the end of the day, going home now that some clubs have ended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2391.226s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I don't know if you could look into that and get us an update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2396.049s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3544.766s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3545.286s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3546.466s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3548.247s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: My question is more about funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3550.147s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: This program is now so important to our community, our school community, as well as our community as a whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3559.33s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: If for any reason this grant doesn't come through, we need to make sure that there's a plan B. I'm sure my colleagues, as the year continues, will help you in the budget if that wasn't to come about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3573.982s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And somehow some way, but are there is there a plan B other than the Cummings are we reaching out to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3580.285s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Bloomberg again, what are we doing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3633.501s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And what costs are involved?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3635.263s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Like, what do you need each year to be able to run this program?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3638.545s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I mean, if we put it out there and people are listening and they hear these children, there might be a donor out there that is listening right now or at some point and hear what you need and be able to step up and help us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3651.617s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So if anybody's listening, we could use checks for CCSR.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3687.146s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4329.102s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4330.163s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: How did this money come about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4332.446s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Did you apply for a grant?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4334.162s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I applied for a grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4335.043s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I just wanted to say thank you very much on behalf of the students and the community, the school community, to take that initiative on and apply for grants that help our students should be recognized because that's very important in tough times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4351.137s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And this gives children an opportunity to work with their hands and their minds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4355.581s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And that's a great benefit that you've just offered all of our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4359.684s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4430.441s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Very nice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4431.022s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4431.782s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4432.803s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just wanted people to know that the current cosmetology is going to remain open while you're building the new area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4440.788s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4450.054s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4450.455s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So just so the community does know that during construction and during the movement,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4455.591s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: that they can still go and get treatments and services in the spa currently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4462.48s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Which when I broke my arm, I took advantage of a few years ago and brought my mom and my sister and everybody got something different meals here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4471.411s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4473.319s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: everything, and it was helpful because I had that broken arm, so I appreciated it then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4478.243s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So everybody in the community should really utilize these programs that they have up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4482.906s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't know how many customers they're getting right now, but it's a great option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4488.11s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You can get your oil changed, your hair and nails done, or any other cosmetology thing that they offer, and then go to lunch and pick up your car and you're ready to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4498.538s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's a great way to spend the day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4500.08s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It might take you a little longer to get your hair cut or done,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4503.282s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: than at your regular spa, but it's really, it's really a great, great program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4511.012s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And just wanted to let everybody know to go to utilize it even while we're relocating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6322.148s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6324.469s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: In order to get people to take these jobs, we have to offer<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6331.293s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: at least minimum wage, just like every other employer in the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6335.295s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And it would be very upsetting if we continued and did not at least offer that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6340.537s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that's my first thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6359.162s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So you're telling me it's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6360.362s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, so I'd like that update at our next meeting and the explanation as to what we're paying and what the rule is, and if not, what our moral obligation is as an employer in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6375.747s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I would request that through the superintendent, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6380.22s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6381.401s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you for putting this all together in the year and a half, almost two years that you've been here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6387.203s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know you hit the ground running.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6389.083s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know you had a whole program to build.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6391.564s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know Diane Caldwell was doing this program prior to you as well as her other jobs and I thank her for all those years of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6400.068s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But the reason we can't expand is because we have someone in your position that does care about not only the students but the staff and the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6409.658s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: and take pride in all pieces of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6412.179s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I applaud you for your job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6414.9s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I also do agree with my colleagues that there are more people on the wait list than you think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6420.438s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: These are the people who have signed on to the wait list, and I know personal family members who have not even applied because they feel like it would take too long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6431.6s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But I don't agree with everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6435.241s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't agree with keeping it secret.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6437.402s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I agree with telling everybody what a great program it is, and everybody has a chance to get in there in April, and that just because you're in there now doesn't guarantee<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6449.064s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: your seat forever and that you should take a chance and apply.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6453.227s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And maybe recommend people that they know to become employed within the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6460.211s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Celebrate some of the programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6461.853s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Highlight them on our online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6464.114s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Highlight them in our paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6466.456s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Show that Medford is here working for working class families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6471.419s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That we do provide great care for our students after school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6474.921s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That we are in need of more people<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6478.164s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: to staff these because the more we talk about it and celebrate it, the more people who have retired might want to do two days a week and come back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6488.192s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Celebrate some of those things and do it like a PR outreach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6493.897s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, and just make people excited like the CCSR kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6498.161s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: get them down to do projects in the afternoon and commit to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6501.183s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We do have one CCR project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6502.284s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: She's coming to teach music to our little guys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6504.285s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Awesome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6505.326s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6505.927s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So there's 150 kids from Medford High School that do volunteer work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6511.711s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I know you've exhausted very, very many ways of hiring people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6517.355s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I might have thrown you a few myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6519.736s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But I commend the work that you do for our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6523.219s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I just ask that we, moving forward, make sure that all our people are paid well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6528.393s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: and we celebrate them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6530.134s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Also, you should know what the income is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6532.455s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You should know that whole budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6534.095s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know it's not, it's a separate entity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6537.756s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think having that information, finding out if there is extra money there to lure people in, to keep people for longer is an important piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6547.32s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I also ask this committee,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6551.337s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: to ask the superintendent to have the assistant superintendent provide us with the budget and where we are now and what we've spent so far this year on this program, what has come in, what has gone out, what we're paying for, an updated budget on this, as well as I think our school committee is due for a budget analysis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6573.019s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: complete budget analysis where we are so far in our school budget, so I, you know, I request that that be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6580.812s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, I know, but I think that's coming, but in addition to that, add this piece to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6588.324s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6611.297s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: that they need every day to learn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6612.098s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And that homework is also being done so parents don't have to do it at your class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=209.302s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, so on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=217.648s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I was showing them writing pictures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=221.311s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: On page 10 of 15, Method High School, the amount of $10,034.31.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=225.433s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It just seems high.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=229.496s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Is there any regulation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=239.703s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=241.464s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=242.765s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And on that same page further down, it says,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=246.121s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Fillion associates other supplies in the end when you add them together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=251.328s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's nine thousand four hundred and thirty two dollars and ninety three cents That's the what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=266.709s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's just all together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=268.71s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's just other supplies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=270.091s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just was curious what they were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=272.732s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: If you could email us, that would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=275.653s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And then...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=280.649s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=282.03s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: On page 12 of 15, Groundmaster Corp, for $390, it was unclassified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=289.954s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just was wondering, I'm assuming it's some kind of landscaping, but I just was wondering where and why it wasn't classified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=298.579s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's the Edgerly Field, so that's just the title of the account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=302.702s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And then further down on page 13 of 15,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=307.979s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The pool service company, it was almost, you know, a little more than $2,600.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=312.501s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Was there a problem with the pool?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=316.722s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because I think the pool was closed once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=318.383s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Closed for a couple of days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=330.527s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=331.247s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And thank you for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=333.564s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you for all the answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=334.765s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I appreciate you always answering them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=336.747s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And the pool was just closed for a few days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=338.948s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They just changed the chemicals and reopened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=341.55s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=342.231s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=343.632s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=351.038s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1096.755s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: This is a great initiative, and I think it's a way to highlight the new bistro and to show other community members that they could utilize this space and rent it and do other things with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1111.064s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Once we have them in the door, we can tell them about all the other great programs like getting their hair done and their oil changed and a dent pulled from their car.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1120.81s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So like even if we have people there that night to just highlight some of those other things, it would be a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1132.098s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1132.478s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And maybe we can even use the deck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1135.53s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: open it up there, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1140.493s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1142.033s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1142.654s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Great thinking outside the box.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1679.792s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1681.452s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: First of all, I want to say thank you for the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1684.553s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: There's a lot of work that your department's done to onboard<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1689.286s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: and to do exit interviews for people who have retired and left.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1693.188s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I appreciate you doing it so quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1694.689s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I had some more questions, though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1697.99s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I wanted to know how many open positions do we currently have throughout the district and what those positions are, like if we do need<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1709.847s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Substitutes for specific teachers or categories, how many people are on leaves and what kind of job titles we're looking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1717.456s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I can help because I work in education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1720.439s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I might hear of people available throughout the community if the community knows that we're in a situation where we do have openings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1727.227s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Someone may have a few months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1729.537s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: that have a licensed teacher or retired teachers might see that and see the need and step up for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1736.102s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I asked for it for that reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1738.724s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And it can be ongoing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1740.265s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It can be in the next few weeks, whenever you can get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1800.681s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And that includes like open temporary positions for short-term and long-term leaves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1805.687s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1806.288s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1806.888s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's good to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1808.63s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I agree with my colleague about substitutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1812.234s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: A parent had asked me if substitutes or paras or other professionals within the building are trained<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1821.573s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: with our emergency plans for the building that they're serving in and their lockdown procedures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1828.339s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So my hope is through the administration, there could be some type of procedure or policy in place for each building for onboarding of temporary and new staff that gets hired after the initial orientation week, just so we check all the boxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1846.068s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Another question that's come up is, are all people within our schools, even volunteers, are quarried?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1853.591s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1855.052s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Just putting every question that I've received out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1858.353s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: My other concern is, as my colleague noted about this specific science teacher, part of the reason there was concern is because eighth grade is a year that we test for MCAS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1869.978s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And if they've had substitute last year and they're again<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1874.442s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But I trust your judgment and if you're telling me that Substitute is a certified teacher and you're supporting them with the new programming and that our director of science is gonna be checking in and really helping them along the way, that I would feel comfortable telling parents that as they approach us and ask us and bring forward their concerns, which I'm really grateful for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1899.094s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We get a lot of emails and a lot of reach out<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1902.71s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: people on my porch around town, I'll text you different things that people are asking to just clarify, because I don't know them all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1911.679s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I did notice today when I was on the website that I think we're not having a meeting on November 4th, so our meeting dates have to be updated there, because that hasn't been updated, just to reflect that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1925.979s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So people are aware that I don't know exactly which dates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1929.36s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I was trying to fill out my, if we're rescheduling the next Monday is a holiday, Veterans Day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1935.041s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I didn't, yeah, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1938.402s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I didn't know if we were going to try it next week or after that, but it's just, just so we're all aware and on the page with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1944.983s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I do try to check different things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1947.024s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1949.287s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I was sad to see that our nutritionists left, especially in the middle of a program, because we were really hoping for success with this new breakfast program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1957.99s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I also was wondering, at the last meeting, we talked a little bit about the middle school bus just getting there right on time for class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1964.672s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And has any movement happened with that so that children are there early enough to ensure they have time to grab a breakfast or eat their breakfast before going in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1974.856s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know I'm putting you on the spot with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=2084.957s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=2085.658s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know there's a great effort here to provide breakfast for our community, and I think it's a good start, a really good, strong start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=2094.206s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I also just, my only concern was a parent in the Hillside area expressed concern that the bus doesn't get there early enough for their child to get.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=2104.396s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's not that they're not releasing them, it's that the bus is pulling up right on time for class, so their child doesn't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=2110.771s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It doesn't affect this particular child, but it could affect other children from that area that might need time to eat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=2119.306s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: because it is before the bell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=2120.987s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's just a concern when we're talking to the bus company to get them there early enough so that they can participate in all of the program, because without the participation, we're not gonna be able to continue this program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=2136.754s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So it's very important for everybody listening to make sure their children or grandchildren go to school early and have a nice breakfast, and it sounds delicious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=2144.857s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I wish that I was there to participate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=2147.947s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5875.111s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5876.192s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'll try to be brief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5877.452s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: First of all, when I saw this and I saw that we were only piloting two items, I was very happy because the less money we spend on assessment means more money that we might possibly have for intervention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5891.438s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I was like, yay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5893.26s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: save a dime now so we can spend it later on actually making progress with students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5899.105s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I had a little different take than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5901.307s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I'd also, at this point, like to make a motion that the district establish a consistent document that all parents receive after each testing just to be informed that their children, where they lied after, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5917.055s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: where they fell after each assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5919.798s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that way, the Columbus School, the wording is the same as the McGlynn School and at the Roberts School and every K through second, it's not teacher specific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5930.37s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: This teacher does it during report cards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5933.874s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just like it sent out a form<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5936.557s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: district-wide, consistency, everybody gets the same, and I request that in a motion form, and I'm looking for one of my colleagues to second that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5971.777s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Maybe the cover letter that goes with the results could be the same language and set up in the same format.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5978.43s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that way understanding is, I just want that communication piece to be given to every parent after each screening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5987.299s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that way we're consistent and we're consistent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5990.542s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I've always been about consistency through the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5994.647s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I just want to make sure that every parent receives it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5999.344s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: after every screening and any progress or any red flags are identified there in a way that we use the same language for each school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6062.143s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'm not saying every.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6065.143s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: letter is gonna look the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6067.405s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: All the content is the same and the wording and the language that we're using as a district is the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6073.609s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The district has provided three different opportunities to assess your children in reading, that type of a form thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6082.455s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: These are the results that we've received so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6085.236s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We will update you again in the winter and in the spring and after each assessment<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6092.563s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: a follow-up letter goes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6093.983s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that type of generalization wording, not the specific thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6097.644s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think we can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6099.025s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So there's a motion on the floor to make sure that that happens for every school building in the elementary schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6106.107s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6861.664s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I was just wondering when was the last time we did a cost analysis as to moving this in-house and hiring people from our community to take on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6872.731s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: some of these tasks as opposed to outsourcing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6876.155s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I know we have custodial staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6880.479s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Have we done any looking at the cost savings by outsourcing this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6886.766s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And could we get that kind of information?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6890.929s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just thought if we can give MedFed people or surrounding towns people jobs with benefits and we can get this work done through hiring people within our community, it's a great opportunity here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6906.695s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And year after year, it goes up and up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6908.696s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And when was the last time we stepped back and say, what do we actually need?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6912.057s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And can we hire people either part-time or full-time and provide benefits and expand our workforce?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6918.62s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I just look at it as a possible win for the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6922.361s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: by providing jobs, so I don't know, I haven't seen that data since I've been here for eight years, so I just thought it was appropriate time to ask for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6932.211s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And even if not for this contract, I'd like to see that and make a motion for that to happen, even if we have to move forward with this contract, so that way the committee looks at this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6943.169s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: or maybe we do a one-year contract while we look into this, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6947.432s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But I just, if we have an opportunity to give someone a job that lives in Medford, in our schools, that takes pride in our buildings and in our students, and it's cost-effective or close to it, I would love to see that happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6963.023s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6988.606s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: When was that last reviewed is my question, and can we review it again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7023.846s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I totally agree, and it is last minute, and as I was sitting here, that's what came to mind, and that's why I'm bringing it forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7030.995s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So what I'm requesting is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7033.444s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: by December, we get a cost analysis, and maybe we move forward now, but in the future, we have that data, and more recent, and then I won't be on this committee at that point, but the committee will have data and information as to whether they wanna keep going with outsourcing, or if we wanna provide good jobs for good people who live in MedFed, and that's what I would hope that this committee does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7099.777s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I would like to make a motion at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7103.12s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7103.58s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Sorry, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7105.442s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7106.158s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'd like to make a motion that we approve this contract for our annual contract instead of a three-year, and that cost estimate be done prior to the end of our negotiations at the end of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7187.058s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'd like to make an amendment to that motion and add that a study be done prior to the next three-year, the end of this contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7203.379s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So moved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1094.289s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, on page one, it says the gymnastics equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1102.191s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: What was actually done?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1103.131s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Did we replace any equipment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1104.811s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's $20,000, or was it just cleaning and maintenance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1108.872s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Oh, it was a four-floor replacement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1110.753s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1111.673s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So now it's very safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1114.153s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you very much for that one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1118.178s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Sorry, this is the day where you run and you can't catch up anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1122.219s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: On page two, I don't have the page numbers, NWEA, I just was wondering what those initials stood for because we spent about $5,000 worth of professional technical upgrades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1152.614s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1158.217s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1160.418s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1164.4s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: No, it's working.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1166.442s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Did I bang it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1167.642s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1168.583s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't have page numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1173.487s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Arctic engineering 30,000 school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1183.59s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1183.87s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just, when they're like big amounts, I just like to know what's going down or going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1189.732s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I think I only have one more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1193.193s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They stuck together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1194.133s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1200.669s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So the math instructional supplies, were they ordered earlier in the year to open up resources and were just being billed now, or are we just purchasing them at this point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1217.914s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1218.414s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And my only question was because there was some concern about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1224.096s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: processing or getting supplies for our math program in the past, and I just wanted to make sure that they had everything they needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1230.639s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They will have everything that they need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1231.88s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1233.06s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you for your answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2176.977s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2178.378s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I first wanted to comment on the patrols that go in through those schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2182.859s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: When it first started, there were so many comments from offices on scanners that I was getting phone calls from my neighbors, what's going on at the schools, why are the police always there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2193.462s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I said, oh, that's just them being visible and more active within our school district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2199.405s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And people were very pleased to hear that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2201.746s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2204.068s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I have some concrete questions about the program, if you don't mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2208.19s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: How many officers will be trained?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2210.331s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Will they be at all schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2213.553s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And will the same officers go to the same schools so that they can build relationships?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2218.455s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Or will they alternate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2287.182s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2288.002s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Um, and is there any cost involved, um, with, with funding this program to the school district?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2298.112s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Not at this time, but in the future, you're anticipating any?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2316.195s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2316.775s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you for doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2318.536s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I understand your idea of getting all the officers in and through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2324.548s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But in the beginning, I think some consistency for our younger children is to getting to know them, and then switching on a regular basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2333.879s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Oh, now you get a new one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2335.3s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That consistency, especially for some of our students, it takes them time to build relationships that it might be something worth looking at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2344.211s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: just as a basic thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2346.694s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I really like the idea of this program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2349.297s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I am thrilled about it and we get books on top of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2353.001s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: This is a win-win all the way around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2355.483s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I really appreciate the police department's partnership with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2358.963s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: and the social-emotional impact it will have on the children of MedFed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2363.586s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I love it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2364.286s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you very much for bringing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2835.149s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2835.569s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you for the updates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2836.75s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I really like hearing everything going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2840.012s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It also reminded me about when you mentioned the free breakfast, I was at a meeting last week and a parent came up to me and said the middle school bus was getting there three minutes before the time to go to class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2853.719s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So there's really no time for those students to go and get a free breakfast before the bell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2859.543s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So could we look at- Yeah, I'm gonna follow up with transportation to try to figure out what- All buses, let's just check to make sure kids are there early enough to have their free breakfast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2871.589s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It didn't affect this particular family, but it just brought to light that some kids who might need breakfast<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2879.891s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: really need to be there early enough so they can have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2882.213s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And if not, then some way those children should be allowed to have their breakfast, even if it's after the bell or somehow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2889.02s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I will look into it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2890.021s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2890.462s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2890.802s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3578.938s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3579.418s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: First of all, I'd like to thank you for all the security measures you put in place with yourself and all of the people working at our buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3587.105s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The lighting changes, the camera changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3590.407s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You're very responsive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3591.668s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Your department has been excellent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3593.79s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And not just now, but you've always<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3597.551s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: done a great job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3599.453s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3600.655s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: At this point I'd like to make a motion for this committee to move forward with studying the security director position so that way when we have this app in place we have someone to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3613.549s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: actually answer that in security measures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3616.351s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know that we had put it forward last year in conjunction with the city position, but since that didn't get approved, I would like to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3625.979s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think this is imperative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3627.56s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think we should have this in place for next school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3630.422s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I need one of my colleagues to second the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3634.605s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3636.545s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=4242.472s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I look forward to hearing more about your continued progress with your learning walks, Dr. Vincent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=4249.215s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I did notice on the back of requested reports, at our last meeting, I requested an update on math supplies, materials, and consumables.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=4258.799s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Would you just add that to the list of reports with the school committee dates?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=4264.997s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Since we were talking about math blocks, I thought it was appropriate at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=4268.359s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=692.58s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=693.561s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Um, Joan, Joseph and I know each other very well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=696.523s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: His older sister was also a scientist and did many activities with my daughter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=703.629s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I saw him as a very young child and he always<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=708.168s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: had this interest in science, and whatever he put his mind to, whether it was playing his instruments, or for Medford High School Orchestra, or following the girls around to the Broad when they did their internship there, I knew he was going to set off and do wonderful things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=728.263s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just thought it would take a little longer, Joseph, to be honest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=732.265s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So if this is the beginning, I can't wait to see what's next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=735.726s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm very proud of you, for yourself, and for MedFed, and for all the teachers that have helped you along the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=743.489s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And mostly because I know the two parents in this room are very similar to myself and my husband, and they're beaming with joy to see you here getting another award.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=754.053s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because this isn't your first year, and I don't think it will be your last.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=757.383s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Welcome back to MEDFED.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=765.667s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So thanks for coming back to see us and keep coming back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=769.769s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2880.103s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mastone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2904.271s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2905.712s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I understand and I can feel your frustration and you want to take action immediately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2910.254s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm just concerned for the students that chose to show up on Friday to now get that change, their frustration with the fact that we changed the policy and they could have gone and still marched or still played<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2925.854s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: and that would escalate that frustration from both their parents and those students that made a choice that was extremely difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2935.541s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So for that reason, I'm going to ask you as another member to just really trust that this policy will be looked at effectively by all of us, because we all want to take action immediately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2948.95s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And what I can do is suggest that that committee meets as soon as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2955.0s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: to expedite your concerns and to say that we are going to take action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2961.864s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We aren't going to sit very long on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2964.586s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I would just hate to be one of the students that showed up and then found out that I could have gone after the fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2974.012s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That would be very hard to process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2977.435s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: As a child, that would be very hard to process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2980.017s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So for that reason, I ask you to wait and trust in our committee, this committee, this very active committee that wants effective change to change this policy very soon and very quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3377.305s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3379.507s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's pretty much what I wanted to add.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3382.754s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Brown was present, and he said there are a lot of experts, not only as teachers in the vocational school, but throughout the community that would love to come and be present and active on this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3395.768s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And a lot of the work that they could do, they could do<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3401.053s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: initial groundwork with the expertise we have in-house without having to pay for anything and just go over just basic information and really research things by professionals that live in the community and it wouldn't cost any money initially and then we can build on that and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3421.448s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: like build with the foundation and then build up and just not incur costs right away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3427.152s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that's what I wanted to add.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3429.373s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think it's an excellent idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3431.215s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think it could be a three, five, 10 year vision for what needs to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3436.938s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And until we see that, once we have a vision, then we can make steps to make it happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3442.472s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And we need to know where we are so we can figure out where we need to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3446.877s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I applaud this committee and its work for bringing this out from that evening and moving forward with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3454.706s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3742.199s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We should, I would like to set up some guidelines of what that committee, since we're building the committee now, can we just put out some guidelines that who we want on that committee, and if any members would like to be on that committee could also express interest at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3759.067s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that way, Kathy already offered to be the chairperson of the committee, and I can second her being chairperson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3767.549s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't know if she can nominate herself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3807.709s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So not only is it school committee members, but it's also community members and teachers May it did appoint me as the person and I requested that committee be added so in a similar way we need to have a way for people in the community to contact one person and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5040.949s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5042.987s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I have a few questions as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5045.028s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But before we start, you said there have been a few struggles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5048.33s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Can you tell us a little bit about what those struggles have been?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5117.877s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5119.239s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Through the chair to the superintendent, could you give us some information as what's holding up any orders?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5125.385s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We're three weeks at least into the school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5128.648s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I would assume that with the new academic program, we had them up and running and ready for teachers for day one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5135.755s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So could we get an update either by email or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5140.419s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: somehow reach out to us as to when all the materials are going to be delivered to all teachers, not just regular ed, but special education, as well as EL teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5153.668s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because I have talked to a few people, and from what I'm hearing, the teachers should have two kits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5160.713s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think there's two different kits that they're working from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5164.836s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And the consumables should be replaced yearly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5170.276s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And in those consumables, there are a lot of things like colored paper, tracing paper, bingo tabs, playing cards, whiteboards, colored pencils, and measuring cups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5183.161s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because I look through the programs to see, and there's a long list of things that teachers need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5191.024s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: What is missing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5192.485s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: What are they waiting for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5194.065s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And how long will they be waiting are a few of my questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5199.33s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And this seems like it's a very, from what I've reviewed, looked like a very language-based math program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5206.459s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And what are we doing to help our students that aren't reading at grade level and helping them to access this as well as our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5218.937s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: non-English first language students that may have trouble with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5223.999s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Not only are they having trouble possibly with the math piece, but if they can't get the language, they can't do the math.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5230.061s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I'm sure that gets frustrating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5232.001s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So, um... Ms. DiBenedetto?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5233.602s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5256.993s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So do those co-teachers have books and have access to the programming that they need in order to provide additional supports to these students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5305.396s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And do the teachers have the consumables necessary to do lessons with the children?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5311.119s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because I hear from you and from teachers that they don't have what they need to, at this point,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5320.953s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: pull out those specific lessons from the programming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5324.937s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And we are three weeks in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5326.358s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'd like to know when, either from you or from the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5557.935s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: My concern is more for consumable and non-consumable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5561.398s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The list that I have right here for sixth grade, the consumables, yes, they are easy to add, easy to pick up things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5570.767s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Doc stickers, power<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5572.742s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: drink mix, colored pencil, masking tape, index cards, sticky notes, glue sticks, paper cups, food coloring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5579.323s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Those things you can bring from home or whatever, but I'm just wondering if we're expecting teachers to do that annually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5586.145s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And non-consumable items that we should have, do we have measuring tapes, cups and spoons?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5592.966s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Do we have wooden and plastic cubes for them to be using?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5596.127s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Do they have the 10 base blocks, the cinders, the meter sticks, the digital scale, the scissors, the snap cubes, the tape, the bingo chips, the playing cards, the whiteboards?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5607.137s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: There are many, many items for these non-consumables.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5610.64s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And not only do we need them in the regular ed students' hands, we need them in every classroom that is teaching this program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5618.166s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I want to make sure if we're hitting a program, we're up and running day one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5622.57s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Teachers have what they need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5624.187s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Education is starting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5625.607s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We're not waiting for deliveries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5628.708s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We knew we voted for this early last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5631.548s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't get why we're still waiting for supplies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5634.909s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I want to make sure that our teachers have the materials to teach it well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5638.83s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Math is a focus for this district this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5641.91s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I want to be successful in saying we bought the best program and we can prove it because we started off right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5650.432s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Let's get it right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5652.096s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: for your sake, for our children's sake, for our teachers' sake, that's all I'm employing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5658.219s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We need to be ready, day one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5661.361s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And we need to fix this as if this is not happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5664.782s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I would like an update at our next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5667.784s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I would like a list of what teachers have, everything that's recommended, and what they're missing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5674.047s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: For all teachers, not just regular ed classrooms, I want to know how many books, who's missing what, who needs stuff, and how much money it's going to cost to get it to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5682.315s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: that we didn't provide enough funds for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5684.596s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because this is a priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5686.456s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I know you've been working very hard, and I applaud you for your effort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5690.337s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But you can't do it by yourself, and I want to stand up and help you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5693.458s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5693.958s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I make a motion for it to come before us again with that list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7085.982s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you, Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7087.983s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Diane, thank you for the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7090.126s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And thank you for making sure that all students K through 12 will get the screenings, not only to you, but to the district as a whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7098.21s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: All of us were very happy to see this come forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7102.972s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I also want to know what our next steps are going to be as a district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7107.155s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Once we identify students' needs and how we're going to work with them to close that reading gap so that way they are meeting all reading<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7121.255s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, benchmarks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7121.996s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7122.536s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: My brain is tired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7123.777s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Sorry So I just like to know like what our next steps as a district are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7130.478s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I also heard last time that there was a dyslexia committee and if we were going to open that up to parents and when, how that will look and what will that look forward to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7188.678s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I think so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7189.559s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think we've done a lot of work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7191.381s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7191.701s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's clear that that the groundwork is here, but we need a plan for the next phase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7196.425s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Like, so once we're, our children are identified, maybe we could have some conversations, um, from now till Christmas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7203.551s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that way, as children are identified, we have a plan to move them forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7231.232s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Right, because in your quote, it says right there that it says you either are identified as needing supports or in interventions or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7243.015s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I just want to know what our plan for interventions are once children are identified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7248.496s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I know you won't have this answer now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7250.736s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Maybe this is a future question, but let's have those conversations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7255.138s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't know if it should go into the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7257.591s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: curriculum subcommittee and just have some ideas and brainstorming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7261.717s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So as a district, what we can put in place to help move these students forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7267.087s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: and to make sure that those benchmarks are made and that we make progress for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7272.829s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I also wanted to know when the district's MCAS scores are going to be released, and I wanted to follow up on students that, you know, weren't doing well a few years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7284.774s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I still want to make sure that those students' growth has caught up and is moving forward and that we're not losing any<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7295.794s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: reading skills or ELA abilities in any specific grade level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7302.097s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Like we looked at that a few years ago and I'd like to look at that again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7306.36s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Certainly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7307.26s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know those, that they're not common knowledge yet and I know it will be soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7312.203s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So maybe we could convene a curriculum subcommittee meeting sometime mid to late October.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7319.167s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7321.803s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you for all your work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8125.629s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That summer program, is there any way to make sure that we can offer that every year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8163.939s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It looked like it was a lot of fun had by everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8167.742s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I think the forward thinking of bringing in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8171.989s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Students from Leslie is is a great plus for our community because we don't have to pay them they get x Experience and we get expertise to choose from when we do need to replace our retiring best teachers Thank you Thank you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=229.082s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=233.549s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=240.633s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I had a few questions if you don't mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=242.494s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=243.374s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=244.235s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=247.957s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=249.438s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: On page first, I have a few.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=252.559s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: My stickies work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=254.32s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: As usual, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=255.081s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: On page 7 of 17.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=258.795s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The National Grilled Bill for 16-2802, it's unclassified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=264.319s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just didn't know why it would be unclassified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=268.962s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Maybe it was just before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=272.344s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's like the fifth one down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=284.958s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: On the next page, 8 of 17, I had a question regarding school, a third of the way down, under Trotter-Richard, $290.12 school committee superintendent's dues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=314.06s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: expenses Okay, I know that mr. Trotter retired from the school district and is still is he the director of the CCS are still yes And so he would go to that before the CCS are correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=328.87s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, just just clarifying but further down the row Christine Sweeney for the amount of $250 lost books I've had deductibles and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=348.51s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And then on page 10 of 17, fourth one down, CT book holdings, it says pending classification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=376.537s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: OK, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=378.199s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: In that, oh, one more, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=382.483s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: On page 14 of 17, second one down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=386.943s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It says $1,868 undistributed errors and omissions for RR Rudy insurance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=400.514s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Oh, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=401.795s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just, when it said undistributed, I just, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=405.598s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=405.959s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Those are all my questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=407.12s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you for always answering them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=408.981s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1357.258s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Could we invite Joseph Farah to come<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1361.345s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: and give him a commendation for his work and his accomplishment and bring him back into the Medford fold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1370.09s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know his family very well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1371.491s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: His brother is also a Medford High School student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1376.034s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The whole family has<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1378.155s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: has excelled in science throughout their career.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1381.497s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: One of their children graduated with my daughter, Una, and they're a remarkable family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1386.739s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And if we could do some type of presentation for him and bring him back and show all of MedFed how proud we are of our students that step out, because if he's at UMass Boston, he's around, and I think his family would love something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1400.766s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We need to celebrate what's happening in MedFed in a big way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1404.768s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We can definitely do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2148.962s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2149.582s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Kress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2151.463s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2151.784s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: DiBenedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2152.684s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2153.145s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just had a few questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2154.425s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Sure, ma'am.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2154.966s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: What time of day is your event?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2161.13s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2163.664s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The expected crowd?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2176.602s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And how much access to a facility will<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2180.341s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: your group have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2198.338s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You bring in porta-potties so you don't have to enter the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2200.74s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2201.14s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: and the building's secure and locked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2203.201s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's good to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2204.743s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just worry a little bit about security.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2219.853s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And prep and cleanup will be done by your group?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2224.236s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I still have a few more questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2226.615s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So all of those seem very favorable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2230.198s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I know that you're applying for a liquor license on the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2232.879s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just want to make sure that there's nothing left over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2235.401s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It is a school grounds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2238.003s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just want to make sure someone walks around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2254.945s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2255.966s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I had a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2257.127s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Do they register through community schools so we know who's using our facilities for liability purposes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2264.612s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Not so much for you through the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2267.554s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You know how they have to apply to use any facility?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2270.136s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just want to make sure that that paperwork's done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2272.397s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: and those applications in that format are logged in so that way we know what time they're coming, what time they're leaving, what the name of the group, who the responsible person is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2282.105s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: If there's an issue, we have a contact number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2284.327s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Any group, even if we donate any part of any of our schools, should be filling that out just so if something were to happen or found later, we can have someone<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2294.737s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We have the documentation to reach out correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2297.981s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I just want to make sure that that happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2301.084s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I don't see any reason for this not to continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2304.468s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: My other question is, do we rent that facility to a church on Sundays?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2308.313s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And how is the parking going to interact?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2311.276s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because I think they have a service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2325.766s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And have we notified them that this will be happening in the timing, so that way, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2336.054s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because I know that other people in the community have asked to do road races and use that area, and timing has been an issue, and I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2344.36s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: that their service is either 11.30 or 12, I'm not positive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2349.769s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So as long as the timing is worked out, it's just something that has to be followed up on because we have steady renters and we just want to make sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2358.099s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: that it works and it's safe parking and people are only parking where it's appropriate, not on the field, out and back where the kids practice football.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2367.607s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: If all those concessions are put in place, especially logging in and noting that it can be free but it has to be logged that you're using the facility and who the contact people are and people are there in place, I have no problem with it and I make a motion to second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2510.08s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: When I was at the cardboard canoe races, I thought of a really good idea, like the school committee and the city council should each make a canoe next year and participate in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2522.047s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I thought it would be a lot of fun for the kids to see and the community as a whole, and we should join in on the fun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2528.01s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I don't know if my colleagues are interested, but I thought it might be something we should plan for the beginning of next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2769.703s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: First of all, I want to thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2774.546s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's not on, Erin?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2777.367s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Is it on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2778.992s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2780.432s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Over the summer, I know that there's a strong group here in works all summer through, and it's appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2787.233s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2787.813s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that when the kids come back and the teachers come back, you're ready for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2791.994s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just have a few questions about some items that you talked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2795.575s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: How are our administrators evaluated?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2798.035s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And are they evaluated annually in a similar format to the teachers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2846.802s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And your evaluations are done by the superintendent on an annual basis?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2851.626s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: For me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2852.587s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: For top administration?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2853.949s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2854.729s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And that's done annually in a similar rubric?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2857.051s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2857.592s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2858.392s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just want to make sure we do it fairly for the whole district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2864.004s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I had a few questions about specific, I got a note from a parent regarding the dyslexic reading committee and how parents might be able to join that committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2888.555s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2889.295s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Also, you know, there was still some,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2894.025s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: some questions about evidence-based programming, but I'll speak with them directly about that, or maybe when we get after the training and you do an update to us about the training.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2924.501s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And how about the dyslexia evaluation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2928.023s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Are those currently happening on our new kindergartners?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2931.486s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Do we purchase that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2933.207s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: that program, remember last year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2954.871s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: MAPS Growth?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2971.889s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just, after the conversations we had last year, I thought we were implementing an evaluation for incoming kindergartners this year to evaluate where they were with dyslexia.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2983.415s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And then we were going to take that until DESE provided us more information at the end of this year for the following years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2992.068s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Did that, that did not happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3004.092s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But this committee voted to move forward and it was between a checklist that teacher observed and checked off or an actual assessment that assessed the children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3017.682s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: is my memory and I thought we were moving forward with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3020.705s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'd like to go back and if we're not, I think we need to relook at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3023.667s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I actually thought it was in the budget for this year as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3027.51s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So maybe the superintendent could put it on the agenda for next week and we can like talk before that next meeting and we could talk about that and make sure that we're all clear about what's happening with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3040.061s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And my last item is the new math program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3043.703s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I did get some calls about that and I was a little I reached out to the superintendent about making sure El in special education teachers had a teaching book and I think that's happening, but I just want to make sure that the colored paper that the teachers need to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3063.815s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: to operate this, and the manipulatives are available to all our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3069.199s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I would request that we put this on the agenda and have the director come forward and see how it's going so far, see if we have enough money to sustain us for all those new needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3083.017s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: and the paper volume, and just maybe an update on how it's going since it's a brand new program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3089.101s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I would also suggest have an update from Rocco as well on the new science program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3094.845s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know that he gets a lot of things in the mail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3097.587s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I haven't heard anything from anyone about that, but I'd love to celebrate that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3106.834s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Oh, perfect timing then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3107.934s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3109.462s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3111.048s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Again, thank you for all the work that you've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3113.255s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know it's been a tremendous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3417.518s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3418.69s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3420.09s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I do remember that us being hesitant to buy something, but most of the programs that you're going to buy, you're going to use them for the kindergarten.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3429.494s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And that's why we weren't going to wait for DESE to make their decision, because we as a committee felt it was too important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3437.731s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: to move forward and then we'll alter it as we need to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3442.373s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But my understanding was every kindergartner at this grade, at this year, was going to be tested and we weren't waiting because we don't want, that was a priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3454.017s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So when you come forward, just please keep that in mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4703.951s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Um, thank you for the update on the CPA requests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4707.652s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I was going to ask that, um, John, thank you for you and your team for all the work that you do, not only through the summer, but through the whole year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4714.894s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's greatly appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4724.157s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So now that I have you smiling, can we get all the rugs cleaned in all the classrooms at all the schools and not just the Brook?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4737.339s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Especially the kindergarten rugs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4739.64s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We've heard over the years how important that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4742.16s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And if we're doing it for one school, they probably all need them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4746.221s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Without a doubt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4746.841s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4747.021s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that's an easy one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4748.922s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We'll get you saying yes to things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4756.333s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The Curtis Tufts, can we get our friends to come in over the holidays and over the breaks to continue the painting that happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4770.921s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And that would be great if we could finish painting that building and spruce that up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4776.204s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So since we're not doing the stairs there, I'm sure there are a lot of needs in that building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4781.848s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Can we allocate those funds that were for the front stairs to something else in that building?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4786.991s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because there are a lot of needs there and sometimes that building's forgotten.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4793.84s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just want to make sure that building is cared for well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4827.485s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, in general, though, that school is looking very worn, and it's a face of Medford, and it needs some help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4835.934s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It needs some Medford Mustang banners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4838.777s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It needs some pizazz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4840.279s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You painted the sign out front, and you keep it very nice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4843.563s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Maybe some more plantings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4845.565s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It needs attention as well as the other buildings in the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4848.808s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And actually, that's really at the beginning of MedFed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4852.834s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's the face, the welcome of MedFed, and it should stand out that it's part of our public school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4858.342s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I would really recommend some more love and care given to our Tufts, and I'm always gonna advocate for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4866.028s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You know, they got the new shades, the floors are getting done, and they look beautiful when they're done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4874.983s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know you've done them, and I know it's a lot of labor to do that, and I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4881.364s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I appreciate all the years that the last few years really updates have been happening in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4886.828s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'd just like to continue that and make sure that that school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4903.072s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I have two more questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4904.393s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The first is the more moisture issue at the Columbus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4907.554s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Is it in an office that's currently occupied?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4910.036s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And if, uh, is it safe?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4911.877s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's, that's my question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4916.159s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And it's, it's not in the area where children are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4970.19s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay in the inside Area will be cleaned up in yeah, we're gonna be taking out parts of walls and replacing them and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4978.158s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And it's contained to that one little area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4980.559s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Exactly, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4985.602s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, I just want to make sure it's safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4989.063s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I'm sure you do too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4990.484s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And then my last one is could we get an update on the curbing and all of that that happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4997.542s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Was that under you, or was that DPW?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5069.154s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So when we last left our meeting, I thought we were getting that machine in that does the cement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5104.739s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I mean, we all know how busy they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5107.66s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So did all schools get the granite curbing that needed them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5130.019s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: First of all, however it happened, I'm sure it was much more expensive, but it was a great need for the school community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5138.806s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I appreciate it being done, as well as many teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5156.824s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I'm just glad that that was done in a way that it's going to be done for many years and not have to just keep revisiting for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5164.208s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm sure that was a greater expense, and I'm not sure where those funds came from, but I'm glad you found them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5171.772s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5172.713s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I know a lot of work went into it over the summer, and it's appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5176.995s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: No problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5178.276s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5877.465s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5878.525s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5879.325s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: If we're requesting the data on charter schools, we should also include private and parochial schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5887.087s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because if the drop off is between ninth and 10th grade, it could be an MCAS issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5892.089s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And we want to make sure that it's still our children if we're educating them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5901.211s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Whether or not it's our dollars, it's still our.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5909.256s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Oh, well, kids that don't want to take MCAS when they go to parochial private schools, they're not held to that standard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5918.539s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I want to know if students are leaving Method High for that reason as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5924.04s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's just as important that we make sure we're educating them and feeling confident so that they don't feel like they have to leave for those reasons as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5945.223s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: All of them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5947.145s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: If we have reasons while people withdraw, if you get the reasoning, if they're going to, like you, when people withdraw, you have to report to the Department of Education the reason whether they're forwarding to a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5960.052s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: another public school district, if they're going to a charter school, if they're going to private, or any way of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5968.499s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And just for our own information, because if ninth graders are feeling like they're not comfortable passing that, and parents are moving them, we want to know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6573.193s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6574.354s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6575.254s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I had some questions and I'm not sure you'll have the answers to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6579.056s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It was about the summer fun camp.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6581.538s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Last year we worked hand in hand at the special education subcommittee to make sure that the staff was trained to and had paperwork ready for all students with any needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6596.7s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that they would be met and I was also curious about having did the price increase in the summer fun camp affect enrollment in any way and if we provided it more families with Vouchers or scholarships to help them through that So maybe you could just get back to us on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6623.819s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=464.608s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=465.729s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Excuse me, counsel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=468.631s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=469.952s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So these are the April 1st school committee meetings that we're approving?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=474.215s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=477.576s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Never mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=477.956s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's a motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=479.237s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=492.042s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Do I have a question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=495.283s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=496.363s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: As usual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=498.744s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So, on page 2 of 15.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=505.88s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: About almost halfway down, Erzner, first name Eric, $107.82.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=512.341s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It says pending classification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=549.318s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, we just don't usually see that pending classification notice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=555.199s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: OK, so the next one is on page 8 of 15.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=560.481s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And it might be the second grouping of second packet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=573.704s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It says legal services for $3,000 more than halfway down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=580.666s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Judith Impatori?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=583.007s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes, that's under the IDEA grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=586.067s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And we couldn't use in-house legal services?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=593.57s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's specific for special education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=595.47s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=601.494s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That is all I have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=603.276s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=603.957s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=648.517s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=650.118s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So we had a Special Education Subcommittee meeting on May 28 of 2019.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=654.7s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And we talked further about the two issues, two items that we have been working on throughout the school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=663.585s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The first is disability awareness program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=665.666s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And the second is out of school time programming for all students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=670.589s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So, in it, we had many people in attendance, committee members, Paulette Van der Kloot, Paul Rousseau, we had the CPAC coordinators, co-chairs rather, and we talked a little bit about the new PD program that was given to district teachers where disability awareness was infused with the existing curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=694.065s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And Teachers Wrote Inclusive Curriculum in an Impactful Presentation was given by Melanie McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=700.452s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: For the first of these six classes, approximately 45 teachers attended this programming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=707.48s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It went extremely well and was very well received by<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=712.185s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: the professionals in our district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=715.949s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We went further on to talk about our OST, which is something I call it, is out of school time programming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=721.996s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That would be before and after school programming, summer programming, and camps that happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=729.683s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Inclusive and welcoming wording was added to the summer fun camp and before and after school handbooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=736.486s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The summer fun camp staff are hired and ready to go and inclusive training will occur prior to the first week of camp.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=743.85s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Before and after school programs were not fully staffed at the end of this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=748.972s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They reached out to returning college students coming back home and tried to fill the gaps with those students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=761.377s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Enrollment for next year, for the after school,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=765.279s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Program is there is a long wait list at multiple schools inclusive training will begin Be given to all of those new team members prior to the beginning of the school year and we ended this meeting with the goodbye celebration for Kathy Medaglio and thanking her for all her years of service to the method public school community and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=787.382s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: She's been a wonderful director of student services, and we've been very lucky to have her serving our students in our community for all these years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=799.171s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And she's sitting here this evening, so again, I want to thank her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=959.311s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I have actually two questions regarding this document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=962.412s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=963.212s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: on page three, towards the bottom, section six.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=967.235s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It says, any Method resident in attendance may be given permission to speak once at the school committee meetings regarding any item on the agenda for up to three minutes on any one item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=978.624s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It just makes it sound like a resident can only come to the mic and speak once throughout the whole meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=984.889s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The wording of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=987.631s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1004.514s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Great, just looking for clarification there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1006.596s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1007.036s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And my second question isn't on the next page, four out of 15, section eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1011.82s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Section eight, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1013.622s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Group committee members who wish to place items on the agenda will provide written notice to the chairperson by Monday noon prior to the scheduled meeting or at the discretion of the chairperson based on extenuating circumstances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1027.717s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1028.918s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Does a chairperson get to decline any item brought forward by a member to be put on the agenda?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1035.56s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because that happened to me last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1038.642s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I wanted an item added to the agenda and the chairperson executed their right not to put it on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1045.805s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I would like that addressed in this policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1097.561s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I would like to see a change where the chairperson does not have the right to put a member's item on the agenda, only because as elected officials, we're here to voice for the community, and I think that a chairperson<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1114.349s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: having that override really prevents you from doing your due diligence as a school committee member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1121.972s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I am requesting that that be added to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1223.66s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: All right, well, I can just, I accept that that's the rule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1230.105s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I also feel like it's a little bit of censorship as a, that one person from our committee gets to decide whether or not something is discussed on any given week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1243.394s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So, I object to that, but I'm happy with moving forward with this at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1250.7s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1274.253s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: As you are aware, Medford Public Schools ended classes on Thursday, June 13th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2529.815s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Do you want to go back to your?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2781.663s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you for your work on this is this the same program as breakfast after the bell or is that a different program?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2831.815s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Do we look into the Breakfast After the Bell and the grant opportunity of $10,000 per school that signs up for the Breakfast After the Bell program?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2844.745s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know, I'm asking if you looked at both programs and made an informed decision between the two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2874.476s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: No, I'm happy that you're presenting us with an option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2877.658s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just wanted to make sure that we were taking<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2880.699s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Every opportunity given to us when a private group approached a committee member with an opportunity to write the grants for us, for us to receive $10,000 per school to do a startup.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2893.384s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just wanted to make sure we looked at that as well as this program and picked the right program that we can sustain long-term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2900.047s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And if we're just picking one and not looking at all options, I want to make sure that all students are fed for indefinitely, not just a pilot program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2917.094s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's a non-profit programming that helps many school districts throughout the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to provide at no cost to them, and they don't gain anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2929.978s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's a public service that they provide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2933.119s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And they do it in the most needy of areas throughout the state of Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2938.222s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And they graciously offered to help MedFed write the grant, actually write them for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2945.466s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I just want to make sure that we're looking at every option available to us so that we have the correct program that we can sustain throughout the whole state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2954.554s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The future of Medford Public Schools, I just want to feed hungry kids, but I want to do it in a way that it doesn't have to stop in December because it's costing us too much money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2963.738s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just want to make sure we do our due diligence and do it once, do it right, and make sure we did our homework.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=4287.942s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=4290.803s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's not on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=4293.504s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=578.846s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just have a few questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=583.07s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: See?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=585.332s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mic tags.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=586.233s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=586.833s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So on page 1 of 23, the second one from the bottom, Boston Public Schools for $2,222, guidance, contracted services,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=598.185s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Do we contract with Boston Public Schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=610.393s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you, I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=611.694s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: On page two, there's a few guys, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=616.117s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: On page two, about 10 up from the bottom, Groundmasters Corp, $5,025, building operators, I was just wondering,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=634.807s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Do we outsource some of that work, the groundmaster?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=638.269s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They are a contractor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=639.65s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, what kind of, do they do specific stuff that our in-house don't do any of the grounds?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=645.033s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know I see them up at the high school growing lawn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=653.359s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Further down on that page, for $50,000 to Robert W. Arvine and Sons, contracted services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=661.804s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That just seemed like a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=663.085s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just thought I'd ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=671.81s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Oh, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=673.071s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just like to know different stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=674.892s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm nosy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=676.033s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: OK, next page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=678.194s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Just about six or seven down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=683.357s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Fringe benefits from method retirement system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=686.518s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: What are fringe benefits?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=699.924s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I think I only have one more, Christine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=702.925s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And it's on page 9 of 23.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=709.137s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's the one I always ask you about, miscellaneous charges, but it looks like it's a lot of money for the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=714.522s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It says Medford High miscellaneous charges is $35,266.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=716.684s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Student activities, the prom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=722.543s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, I'm just curious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=724.264s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just like to know what those big line sums are because I forget from time to time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=757.856s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1294.416s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1294.956s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I want to congratulate Albert.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1296.417s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I've known him for many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1298.278s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: His older sister was also wonderful in science, as was his older brother.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1303.74s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We have seen them come before us for many, many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1307.422s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And we still have one more year left to go, so I can't wait to see what that's going to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1312.524s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Secondly, I also want to comment on having those new science labs and opening up opportunities not only for our vocational students, but our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1322.496s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: high school students and bringing Tufts down and partnering with them and it really opens up so much for students in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1332.119s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know myself as when my daughter was a junior, she was able to go to the Broad and work in the organic chemistry lab and that opened up doors for her actually through today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1342.301s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So Method has amazing programming and kids do wonderful work and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1348.693s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't know, but I see rocket science from Albert.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1352.054s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think I've always seen that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1353.675s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We've heard that tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1355.335s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I can't wait to see what he grows up and does for all of America and us in general.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1361.717s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So our future is great because of students like that, and because of the educators who devote their lives and times to make sure our students have all those opportunities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1370.78s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So thank you to them as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1760.02s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1760.94s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1762.141s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I see a lot of English Portuguese.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1765.742s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We don't offer Portuguese as an AP class at Medford High, do we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1770.744s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's my understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1838.05s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So, Mayor Burke, that's what stood out to me because I knew we didn't have Portuguese as a class<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1845.497s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: at MedFed High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1847.078s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know we have a large population of Portuguese people moving into MedFed in that it might be an opportunity to add that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1857.724s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But also, just even maybe working with that ESL director to encourage more of our students that have been in the ESL program to initiate and to feel proud and strength and show them your native language<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1875.376s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: you can still take that with you and not lose it while you're here and it can be celebrated through these exams.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1885.127s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm hoping to see more of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1925.721s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1926.161s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you for your time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2078.635s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto, can you just clarify the total cost of the trip?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2083.48s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Insurance, I want to make sure you understand that insurance is not an option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2087.104s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It has to be included in the price.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2089.546s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We made that motion many years ago when we had to cancel a trip abruptly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2159.668s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So the $2,100 is for the ground tours and the hotels and all of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2165.149s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Does that include the flight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2167.289s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It includes the flight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2169.51s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2170.19s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2170.71s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that's for everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2172.09s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And how are chaperones chosen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2186.434s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And then... How much do chaperones pay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2213.749s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: In the language as well, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2486.376s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2487.797s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2488.778s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2489.198s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I wanted to say welcome to MedFed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2490.96s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I had the opportunity of meeting you at a subcommittee meeting for personnel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2497.985s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I enjoyed meeting you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2499.246s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think that your talents will be greatly used here in MedFed and welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2505.351s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2675.619s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mayor Burke, I love our food policy and how we make sure that when kids are in line, they're not stigmatized if they don't have money and that we're going to continue to give them a lunch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2688.087s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just don't want, I know they can't take other items, they can just take a general lunch and like money isn't discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2696.87s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: at that point when their friends are in line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2699.492s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just wanted to reiterate that we do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2702.635s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's a very important point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2704.296s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I also wanted to talk, actually a community member texted me this morning with an offer to help us write a grant for $10,000 per school for Breakfast After the Bell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2717.567s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I would like to connect that person to our superintendent<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2725.193s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: and our superintendent in charge of finance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2727.854s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And see, I know we have it on the books to look into, Breakfast for All, but this is one particular program called Breakfast After the Bell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2736.959s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: This community member runs a group that will provide you someone to help you write the grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2744.773s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And it's 10,000 per school, not per district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2747.855s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So every school in the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2749.396s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I would love to see it all the way from kindergarten through our 12th graders, because our high school students are hungry as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2755.799s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I wanted to just keep that in mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2758.681s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'll provide the information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2760.222s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think I would love to see if we can get a grant to help us get underway with that initiative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2767.746s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know two of our schools get breakfast now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2770.524s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I would love to see every student have breakfast and have a successful day, because they're not walking into a classroom hungry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2778.27s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So just those two comments, and thank you for the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4482.464s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4483.686s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4484.246s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4485.668s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4486.028s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4486.889s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Stone had her hand raised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4491.697s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You don't usually put your hand up, so I bow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4614.707s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4615.968s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4617.048s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: First of all, throughout this year, I've gotten to see many<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4624.806s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: instances where the collaboration between the Special Education Administration and the CPAC have worked together, and it's been really a joy to watch, because a lot of districts don't have that, and we do in MedFed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4639.551s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We have an excellent CPAC that's very well organized and trains us in a lot of different things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4645.833s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I've learned a lot at some of the meetings, and so have so many of our parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4651.874s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'd love to see an increase<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4653.942s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: in your enrollment and participation in those programming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4657.743s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So in any way that the district can help facilitate that, either with the auto call or some ways, I would love to see that as a goal for next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4668.506s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4669.166s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: As a school committee member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4671.587s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And any way that we can enlighten more parents and more families to your programming and to these opportunities to learn more in order to help their children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4683.31s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: is also a benefit to all throughout the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4687.031s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I've also had the opportunity to chair the special education subcommittee meeting that is a new subcommittee that we formed about a year ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4695.912s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I want to thank my colleagues for coming to all those meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4699.393s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I tried to provide good snacks and keep it to the correct time frame and really just<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4709.362s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: make sure we didn't ask for 20 things when we could ask for two and really facilitate change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4715.425s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I feel like moving forward, if you work on two basic things, three are tops, you make effective change and that change sustains for years to come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4727.591s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I would make that recommendation to the CPAC as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4730.952s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know there's 50 things that you can think of that the district could improve because we all want the best for our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4737.285s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But we really need to focus and plan for next year and see what those items are going to be with the superintendent as well as our new special education director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4749.093s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I also want to take this opportunity, because it is the last meeting of the year, to call up Kathy Medaglio for a minute, if you don't mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4756.858s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Oh, when you're finished.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4941.341s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, come on over, come on over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5007.573s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mayor Burke, if it's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5011.115s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5013.356s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I know we have another meeting on June 17th, but this is the last meeting where, you know, parents in the district may be watching because their kids will be out of school for the next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5023.942s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I just personally, I've worked as a school committee member for eight years now, and I work in special education in my day job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5031.811s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I just want to say how much respect I have, in admiration for Kathy Medaglio.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5036.633s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know she's retiring this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5040.074s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just wanted to say what a pleasure it's been to work with you on so many issues for so many families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5047.577s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You've been an excellent SPED director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5049.378s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Not only do you pass all of our coordinated program reviews with flying colors, which is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5055.267s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: a really great accomplishment for a school district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5058.67s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You also work with compassion, and you keep what's best for the children in the district at the forefront, mostly the children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5067.056s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I can't tell you how much respect I have for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5071.379s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you for your years of service in MedFed, and you will always hear from me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5076.563s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't know if that's a good thing or a threat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=290.385s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Question of a report being presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=294.066s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Could we just add it to the outstanding reports list?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=298.448s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It was the cost analysis for the dyslexia screening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=303.11s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Could we just add it to the list of reports due to us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=307.511s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Will do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=308.192s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=309.192s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: On the motion for approval of the minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=323.258s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mayor Burke, I have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=329.92s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: There was, sorry, I'm saying hi to all our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=335.881s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: On page three or four, I had a question under trustees of Boston College.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=341.783s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Is that outside special education tuition, or what type of tuition is that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1082.754s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I second Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1084.394s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Van der Kloot's motion and I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1086.99s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: that time has changed, awareness has changed, and we need to look at other resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1095.136s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I second Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1096.377s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Van der Kloot's motion and ask for a roll call vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1100.54s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Ruggiero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1703.005s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1703.926s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1705.486s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Many years ago, both my children were in the high school orchestra.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1709.368s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And when Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1710.649s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Chang first came to the district, she taught my daughter how to hold a bow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1717.091s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And the beautiful way in which she looked at each and every detail with the students from day one leads to this beauty that we've all witnessed here this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1728.236s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So to Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1729.097s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Chang, thank you for your dedication to the students<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1741.303s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So since I've lived here, Mr. Zigney has been part of the orchestra, and there's over 100 children in our high school orchestra.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1748.425s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And many of us in this room have had children go through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1751.606s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I also thank him for his dedication for all the years of service throughout our community, because this is brilliance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1759.328s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: This is amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1760.708s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I had the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1764.46s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I was invited by one of your students to come to their concert at the McGlynn last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1770.105s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And my husband came with me, and he hasn't heard Medford's orchestra play in a few years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1776.55s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And he was blown away at the expertise of the students in this group and how they've developed over these 10 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1784.297s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You make us proud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1785.818s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You make us all very proud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1787.179s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=3116.511s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto, you talked about the decrease in the science curriculum, and this year we have just adopted a new science curriculum, so we're hoping to see growth in the next few years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=3129.763s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Usually when you adopt a program like our ELA or our math program, which we've gotten, which we got in the last few years,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=3138.557s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It takes an average of three years to see any progress on an MCAS or a standardized test because it takes years of instruction for the students to learn the new vocabulary and move forward in those areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=3154.709s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So even though we got our programming early and we're starting a little early with training, we'll see that in the next few years with science.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=3165.976s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And we should be seeing that in the English language arts program, because we did invest about four years ago in a new ELA program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=3174.583s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And we should see that growth among all subgroups because of that programming, because students have had it for consecutive years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=3182.57s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And as they grow up, and if we don't, then we have to realize that maybe that's not the right program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=3189.095s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that's a good way to look at what our curriculum is and make<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=3193.479s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: good choices going forward, and I applaud you for coming forward and advocating for the students in your school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=3200.985s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We need to see more of that here at school committee, and I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=3206.089s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's not always easy to go there and speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=3208.211s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you for your time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8593.054s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8594.275s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you, Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8596.315s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: First of all, I want to thank everybody for waiting so long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8598.876s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's been a long night already, and we have a ways to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8602.038s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But I want to talk about enrichment and the opportunities you provide our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8607.2s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Some children learn new things because you're taking time raising money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8614.143s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They experience things that they wouldn't necessarily experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8619.565s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They get new books and get to read about faraway lands.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8622.866s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The things that you do matter to people's lives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8625.667s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I just want to really tell you how much, as a school committee member, when you buy books for a library, that touches my heart, because our budget only goes so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8635.751s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So the work you do enriches not only the children's heart, but also helps us as school committee members when we run out of dollars and we wish we could buy those brand new books that everybody's talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8648.2s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: or send kids to a museum that the school budget just doesn't have the funding for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8653.442s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So as a member, I thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8657.544s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Playgrounds, we saw great work with one of our playgrounds, and that was parent-driven, and that was Cheryl, and well, actually, two playgrounds got improvements this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8670.149s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And we need to move forward with that, and this committee has made that a priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8674.511s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Just so you all know, that is on our master plan<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8678.19s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: our capital improvement plans, and we do take that seriously, both for safety, both for physical ability for kids, and we want kids to get outside and have time to play.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8689.472s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It helps the rest of their day, and it helps their learning environment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8692.673s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So just to follow up on that, that that is a committee thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8698.253s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I also wanted to make sure that all of our PTOs, PTGs, are now 5013Cs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8705.335s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't know if most of you know me,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8707.517s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: but I want everything to be, go through the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8713.319s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think it's transparent, I think everybody's on the same page, everybody's following the same rules, all the offices are listed, all the bank accounts are there, there's checks and balances, so that's a question I have for this evening to make sure that they're all registered with Medford Public Schools, and when you're raising money, oh, all the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8736.082s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Right, all the ones, and the city-wide one as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8739.426s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We are not a wide one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8740.787s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We are just a group of people meeting and fundraising and going back to our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8746.674s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, could you come to the, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8843.793s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8844.574s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: As long as that's looked at and there's rules and bylaws and things followed for that grouping that's similar to the other grouping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8853.68s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I just want to finish off by saying I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8858.892s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: When your children transition into middle school, you step back as a parent, and we are losing an opportunity to keep those parents involved in our district and in our children's lives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8873.655s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And they're feeling already that their children are more independent, so they have more time to give as their children get bigger and older.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8883.457s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I would just suggest that we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8888.62s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: well, that you include the middle school PTOs, especially because it would add value to those students' lives and you have an opportunity to gain help with the citywide program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9006.062s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Just as a follow-up, sorry, and then I'll yield to my colleague.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9012.246s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: A few years ago, you actually helped us develop the online program, so you understand the intent I have for it, be it anybody fundraising, using Method's name, be registered with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9026.211s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So in some way, shape, or form, I would like this group registered, even if it's not as a 5013C, just so that we have it through the superintendent's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9038.427s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9038.967s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's my only concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9040.65s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9199.459s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you for your time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9200.119s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you for coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9327.374s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Oh, wow, Mia.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9569.681s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9571.002s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just wanted to say that Joan had an outstanding interview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9574.524s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: She was prepared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9575.525s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: She knows the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9577.982s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: She was well-spoken, she has new innovative ideas, as well as keeping things that we currently have in place going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9587.047s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I came out very impressed with her through the evening, and she was the clear choice for our district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9594.53s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I just want to say congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10426.216s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Right, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10836.193s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10837.353s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10838.954s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'm a proponent for breakfast before, after, during, whenever the bell rings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10846.696s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We all are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10849.177s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: No student should, no student can focus on reading, math,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10856.423s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: anything if they're hungry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10858.644s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They can't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10859.604s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So my question is, how long and how quickly could we do the research necessary so we can begin this for the beginning of next year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10869.687s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Just answer some of the questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10871.527s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I have one question, is I know that if we're not collecting free and reduced lunch paperwork, that also affects our high school students when they're applying for SAT exams, because they get them<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10885.87s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: for less money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10887.271s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: When they apply for colleges, they get reduced rates for their college applications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10892.335s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So year one, we're doing the applications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10895.258s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: On year two, we still, as a district, have to collect those forms so that way our high school students still receive those benefits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10904.225s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I don't want it to be done less important, because it is very important for those kids in order to apply for their colleges and take their<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10914.97s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: PSATs and SATs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10916.391s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know we pay for PSATs now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10918.393s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But those are other issues that we need to see how it affects by not doing that paperwork on an annual basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10925.618s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'm all for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10935.806s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just want to stress the importance that there are reasons to still collect those papers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10942.172s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: There's things that people don't see in these programs that it also, it continues not just free lunch, free and reduced lunch, it also affects other programming that our students apply for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10954.818s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So even though this program says we wouldn't have to collect it, I would still want that data for the district as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11044.334s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So would you be able to provide that report by our next meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11047.536s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Absolutely not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11049.217s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that's the time frame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11050.598s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I need to know when would you be able to provide this body with the information so we can move forward for next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11057.102s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11058.6s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just want to know before we vote on that, if you say, I need till the end of June and before we disperse for the summer, that's great, but if we're going to, I just want to make sure something's in place, that we have all the information, but we still move forward, as my colleague motioned, to make sure our students are fed as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12901.834s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12902.014s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: DiBenedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12903.035s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12904.415s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I only have two concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12906.336s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I wholeheartedly believe in research and the data that it can provide both for future treatments of generations of kids<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12916.334s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I also absolutely hate vaping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12920.275s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I think that we're going to have major health issues with our 40-year-olds that have started vaping now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12927.337s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And it makes my skin crawl because I'm so worried for this generation of people that are choosing to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12935.94s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I wholeheartedly want to see anything that helps our students succeed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12941.921s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I want to make sure it doesn't interfere with the academic day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12945.16s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: of our children, because we're here to educate children first, as well as keep them safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12952.481s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But I have two concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12953.962s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: One, I don't like passive consent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12956.542s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think there's too many areas of people not seeing that one paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12961.363s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I would like to see signed consent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12963.503s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I would like parents to know what their child is in for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12967.224s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that's my first concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12969.045s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I would also like to see student consent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12972.525s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: because I don't want, I want the students to buy in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12976.426s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Just from what I heard, that I was taking notes as it was, and we talked about passive consent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12982.767s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I had said that in our initial, I mean, our things as well before I came here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12988.928s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just don't believe in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12990.088s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think there's too many ways that we can lose communication and trust with parents when you do that, and I think that we should have signed consent<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12998.383s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: in this type of a situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=13000.304s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And really boast what we're trying to do as a community is to change behaviors in our youth and protect them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=13012.451s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So it has to be like a big campaign that we get by and people are aware of what they're buying in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=13020.156s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So those are my only two concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=13022.137s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And when the superintendent's ready to tell us that it won't interfere,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=13027.523s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: with programming and she feels that it's the right time to move forward with the vote on this, I respectfully wait for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=13035.238s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I will motion at that time to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14673.729s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So through the mayor to our superintendent, were there any other programs piloted that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14682.992s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: caught in a different way that we didn't have to bump over some bumps the first year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14687.573s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because we haven't had a program in so long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14690.213s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: To hear concerns is concerning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14693.394s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And to invest money into a program that has bumps is concerning to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14698.675s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I want all students that's computers aren't working for a week at home to still be able to go home and keep up with the class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14709.091s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: hate to have someone's computer break down and them not to be accessing homework for an evening in middle school and fall behind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14715.953s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because math basics build on each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14718.694s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And that's my only concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14720.875s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I trust that you think that this is the best program, but I'm not sure it's the best for our population.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14826.854s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I would like to know what the whole financial cost is for us, and I would also like to know if those other districts have the same demographics as ours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14837.217s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Is it Arlington, Lexington?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14842.038s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Somerville has... It does, but they also have more money than most districts have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14846.119s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Somerville as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14846.739s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So they give their students... Yes, Somerville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14867.717s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And if it doesn't work in two years, are we going to reassess and provide another alternative?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15438.632s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm all, I'm ready to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15444.033s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I do, I've never seen that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15689.127s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Early?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15689.668s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Oh, my gosh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2353.877s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2355.158s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I also, I just want to thank the parent for coming forward and putting her face to what we're learning about next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2363.746s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And her family's story, telling it publicly is not always easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2369.132s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And it helps make it relevant as we learn more and what our next steps should be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2377.577s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It puts a picture together for us that what we're working for, and I appreciate you coming forward and sharing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2384.082s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's very important for us to see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2386.965s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2388.586s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2388.686s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Van der Kloot, did you want to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4397.52s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4398.561s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you, and thank you for your presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4401.582s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It sounds like you're working with a lot of different districts, and we want to know how we can get<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4406.894s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: you to work with the Medford district, what would be involved in that, what way you see us beginning, how you could walk us through some of the process, maybe come up with some ideas with our superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4419.52s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't know if there's any grants we can apply for, because this is a new initiative coming out from the state, and how we get expertise like yourself in helping our children in our classrooms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4512.308s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I had a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4513.108s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Is it a funded mandate or an unfunded mandate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4516.331s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Is there grants available?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4520.054s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4521.435s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You know, it's great to have mandates, but we as a committee or a school district have to find ways to fund these changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4530.142s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And if there's fundamental changes in how we need to teach reading and literacy to our early readers or early<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4540.714s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: beginning people, I think that education is like a foundation of a house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4546.377s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: If you catch it early and you have a strong foundation, you have a beautiful, strong house for many, many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4552.32s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I always would love to do that, and I think this is worth investigating further for our district, and I would like to make a motion at this time through the mayor, to the superintendent,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4566.752s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: please investigate and give us some costs involved in bringing either a landmark program, Dr. Gobb, or something similar before us with this budget so that way we can move forward immediately and less families and children have to come before us pleading for help for their kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4586.817s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think this is tremendous, not only for kids with reading deficiencies, but I think how we look at reading fundamentally<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4596.232s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: and not early learners, so I'd like to make that motion at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5490.411s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5493.103s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5494.104s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5494.604s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I have a few questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5495.804s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: First of all, I'm wondering if the task force next steps, if the task force can contact the Andover Public School, look at what they're currently doing based on the information we received tonight, and see what screenings they're using, how much they're paying for it, like all of those connections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5514.054s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I would appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5515.215s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And maybe even reach out to the landmark program and see what they can have to offer us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5527.174s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I want to know why the kindergartners aren't being tested until later in the school year, when we know that even testing them before they come would be the best idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5537.638s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I would like to do that as their kindergarten screenings happen, because we do screen them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5564.482s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Before you answer that, why are we using an assessment that doesn't assess the student's needs, and it just answers questions to the teachers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5573.388s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't want that type of assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5575.222s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I want the assessment so we do it once and we know what the student need is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5579.225s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't want it to have two steps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5582.327s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So speaking on that piece isn't what I really, I don't think is the direction from what I've learned this evening as the future for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5591.634s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But again, I'm not a PhD and I don't know this and I know you guys are the educators and have that information and background.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5600.064s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just don't want to be redundant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5601.405s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't want to answer questions that a teacher just gets an idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5604.186s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I want to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5651.577s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I get your point, Superintendent, and I have great respect for your academic knowledge and base, but the doctor suggested there are eight or nine programs that she could recommend that are available right now, and rather than buy two programs, I would really rather invest our money right into what we need for our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5672.551s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't know, maybe you both could speak a little bit more on that so I learn more, but that's the direction I see from what I've learned this evening,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5703.399s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But we're buying this right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5742.88s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5743.864s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: My only point is with that, do we know that the cost difference between one of those eight programs and this program is significant?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5770.925s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I also look at the long-term piece and how, like, if we know early and we can remediate services early, then you need less services long time, and that actually saves us money as a district when you're looking at the big picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5786.968s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So, you know, I'm hesitant for a quick fix.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5790.449s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know DESE hasn't made their choices and it's hard to invest in things, but I just don't want to throw $1.07 away per kid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5800.787s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: in a year's time of intervention that to me is worth the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5806.03s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't know if it fits in our budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5838.319s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: No, I didn't think that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5839.96s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But I just felt like the other one, the other assessment would clearly identify like there's four different areas in a child's area<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5848.789s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: that needs direction, the other one would identify the right area to work with, with the child, whereas the other one is just a general, oh yeah, you need help, but you don't know where to actually help, you know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5861.573s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Like, where the weakness is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5864.014s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Well, there'd be more work after.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5866.155s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Maybe we could just have a cost analysis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7520.78s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7522.241s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know this has been a big project and a lot of work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7526.683s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But something I noticed when I'm looking at these accounts, there are areas that I don't see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7532.486s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't see football.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7533.726s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't see boys hockey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7535.067s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We have girls hockey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7536.548s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't see boys baseball or boys soccer, but we have some of the girls teams.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7542.05s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just don't know why<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7544.204s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's like all activity accounts aren't listed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7547.492s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's more of my question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7548.976s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm not even sure if you can answer that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7604.004s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So a little bit of history.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7606.146s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Many years ago, before I was a school committee member,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7610.14s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: there was a question with the student activities account, and at that time, I believe, either when I first got on or right before I first got on, and maybe Member Bandicoot can help me with this memory, is that all student activity accounts were supposed to go and be registered through the high school accounts, and all of these should be listed here, and all money's deposited and processed in that manner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7639.289s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know the Medford High School PTO at that time had their account in that manner because I was on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7654.043s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7685.708s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So does that mean like a lot of the ones that aren't listed here may be under a 5013C or a not?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7695.481s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: non-profit group like, you know, the Friends of accounts and aren't those programs, like we made a motion here about two years ago that those accounts also had to register because they're using MedFed's name and MedFed students to raise money and they were supposed to by September 1st, I believe, or October 1st of this year,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7722.082s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: be on this list?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7726.504s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7767.526s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, so my last question, and it might be a mix of both.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7770.788s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So say I see on Facebook that a certain group is having a camp up at our community schools through the summer, and it's, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7780.717s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It has MedFed name on the camp, and they're running it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7785.0s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Does that money go through community schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7787.602s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Does that go through student activities?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7790.384s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm just not clear on how we're doing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7794.247s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Or do they just rent space from us, and they get to charge people at the door?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7801.092s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: There's no clarity and accountability for how all this money is coming and going, and that's what I'm afraid of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7809.073s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Not that I believe that people are doing something wrong, but when money's passing hands, there is temptation there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7817.338s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And if the school district is, if they're utilizing our buildings, we need to be paid for that, so that way we can provide heat and electric and paper towels and those type of products while they're there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7829.165s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And we know, for liability's sake as well, who's in our building when,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7834.888s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Are they our employees?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7836.109s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Are they renting our facilities?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7837.79s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We're liable in a lot of these situations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7841.032s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because if someone were to get hurt and we don't know, that's really scary too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7848.317s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So there's a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7850.871s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: trying to figure out this puzzle piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7852.932s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And that's really what I'm looking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7876.902s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you for providing this list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7880.264s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Maybe we could make a motion to have, at some point, maybe in the fall, like a look at this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7888.187s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Look at how money is going through community schools, how money goes through student activity accounts, and how money goes through, you know, friends, and what we know about it, and how we want that structured so we make sure that we're following all guidelines and that things are done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7907.473s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: In a real way, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7909.975s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: in what our responsibility is as a school district as far as liability when they're in our building, if they're renting it from us, as opposed to running the group through us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7923.442s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So it's just been involved for a long time and some clarity would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7929.085s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'd like to make a motion for that for early fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7932.546s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And thank you very much for your time in presenting this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7938.089s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I have a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7941.532s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: To look at these three different venues, community schools, the friends of, and student activities and how money goes in and out of each and how we're tracking that system, if there's a better way that we need to look at this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7960.605s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And we can send it to a subcommittee or something, but it's just...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7965.425s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: There's a lot of usage in different ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7967.826s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And there's other things, too, like when we rent our buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7972.247s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: If a rental is using our building and they're using more space than they're renting, and if they're going into classrooms and taking people's things, or utilizing things that are in the building when they're not supposed to, those type of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7987.731s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think we just need to look at this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7990.643s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: like whole picture of what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8517.321s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: to provide us with that information before the end of the school year, so we can look at different things together, and just look at them and say, how come this group is over here and we have... And I think it would add more clarity for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8532.665s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So, instead of making a motion, just a request to have the activities account next to the friends of under the new way that they have to enroll in the friends of, and that information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8607.582s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So we had a presentation and we have a form that Emily has that groups provide their bank account information, who's running those groups, and information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8620.647s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's the group I mean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8638.306s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So you can compare them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8639.146s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8639.266s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: How many groups are listed in that right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8641.587s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Do you remember?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8641.987s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't know off the top of my head.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8660.683s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And it's on the calendar to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8662.764s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We just asked that we add the student activities at that point so we can see both that new group that you have listed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8670.188s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because all of those groups need to do that annually<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8674.983s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So they have to do that by September 1st, and you'll have the information to provide to us by October 1st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8686.972s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8687.252s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's why we made it October, give it a month to make sure that we could compile the information and present it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8693.777s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=604.49s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I had a couple questions on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=608.229s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: the set that says vouchers paid March 30th through April 5th on page three of seven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=620.753s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's a $600 conference, but we couldn't read what it was, National Association for Educational of, do you have any idea what that conference was for and who attended?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=653.272s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It says unemployment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=655.233s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Do we have people currently on the unemployment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=728.244s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: DiBenedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=729.505s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Just a note about the notes at that thank<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=734.73s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So it doesn't reflect a lot of concerns or ideas that were brought up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=739.093s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It just gives bullet points, I think, a little bit more information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=743.396s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know at that meeting, we would have put more items on the capital improvement plan, but we were hoping to get a grant for the whole high school, and that's why those items weren't on there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=755.884s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And concerns raised whether a big<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=761.434s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: grant would be funded by the city council was also raised because it would cost the city money to match grant funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=769.964s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So all that type of information, I always look back at these notes, so if they could be included a little bit more, I'd appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1146.398s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1148.559s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Paulette, I agree with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1150.36s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think that this is a beginning of a conversation to make not only that building but all areas around our schools better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1157.242s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know last summer that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1159.647s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They did a walk around the outside of all the elementary schools and identified areas that needed to be improved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1166.47s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And John did an amazing job with his team beautifying a lot of that, those areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1173.153s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So, I want to give kudos to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1175.134s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So, it has begun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1176.834s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Maybe we need to do that at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1179.856s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But while I was at an event up at the vocational school the other night,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1188.223s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Chris Donovan outside in the dock with Fritz and our station manager, our community access manager, they were out there putting up spotlights through the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1201.672s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And he has pictures on his Facebook account and I have some on my phone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1205.775s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Maybe I'll share them so we can add them to the blog.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1208.337s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They had up lights, blue lights of the whole high school and it looked amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1212.4s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And certain doorways were all lit up blue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1215.482s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It transformed the whole area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1217.616s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: and they had up lights around the things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1220.438s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: He also noted that we do have great lighting up there now because it was dark, but it's very harsh lighting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1227.003s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So maybe he said he might be able to help us get filter over them so it's still bright, but not as prison yard-like, might have been the wording.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1241.835s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That was one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1242.876s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But it looked amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1244.537s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And just seeing that little difference made a huge difference walking in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1248.919s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And Fame was up there this weekend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1251.46s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They had Fame written on the wall of the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1254.862s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It was beautiful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1256.303s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The school looked really, really pretty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1259.745s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So there's a lot of different ways we can put lipstick on it to make it look prettier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1268.758s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I make a motion to, I second, well, I agree with both my colleagues who want to look at this issue and do some beautification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1278.758s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1345.857s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1603.206s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=2054.866s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=2055.006s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: DiBenedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=2056.668s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=2057.129s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I love the project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=2058.03s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Is this a one-year project, or will we have the pickup for additional years?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3414.333s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3414.613s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: On this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3415.514s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes, this is regarding this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3416.795s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: At our meeting last week when we were discussing languages, we asked for a follow-up report on the number of students at each grade level and which languages they currently took and what they were planning on taking for next year so we could help with our budgeting plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3436.72s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I know that that's not on the back of our questionable... It's in the budget committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3442.664s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3841.288s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3843.069s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I don't know if it needs to be in a capital improvement plan or added to next year's budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3849.494s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't know which is the better way to do it, because we do have athletic budget that came before us earlier tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3855.617s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'm not sure if this warrants a capital plan and a superintendent of finance would be able to address that, whether we should just put it in for next year's budget under the athletics department and not have to go through city council approval and all of that and make sure that we have the funding there to make sure our gymnasts are all set for the day after Thanksgiving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3883.517s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: a different way to look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3884.698s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3885.378s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Just making sure those funds are available and accessed right away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3893.421s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Well, that's my next question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3896.623s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: When I asked for this to be put on the agenda, I also asked for the finance piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3900.724s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: How much are we actually making from renting out that area of our school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3905.526s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't know if we have those numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3907.547s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I got them for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3908.087s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You want them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3908.968s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes, I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3939.813s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So are any of those funds reallocated back into the equipment and the maintenance of that area that you're aware of?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3956.461s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But they're clearly raising that money over a few years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3970.03s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You know, I would move to add this $20,000 to this year's budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=4000.239s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I make a motion to add this $20,000 to the athletic budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=4048.399s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=4049.852s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=4050.212s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=4051.472s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So just to continue, if we're going to be doing the floor, can we look at that room and see if it needs a paint job?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=4057.473s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because you don't want to paint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=4059.574s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=4078.32s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, I just figured since we were in there doing this type of scope of work, it's the right time to look at the whole area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=4090.744s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And could we just, I know you said you've replaced some equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=4095.385s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Could we just check all the equipment at that time, make sure that this program's up and running, and maybe put it on a schedule to make sure that URIs are serviced?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=4106.74s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, and so like maybe we keep a list somewhere, like a spreadsheet, like we asked for for other equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=4117.527s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's really good to have for our athletic equipment, so we replace things as of, like this evening when we're putting more money back into<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=4127.055s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: the weight room in that area, so that way we don't get fall behind the eight ball and have to replace everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5468.08s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5469.12s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5470.161s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: First of all, I really liked all of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5473.661s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And it's amazing to see all the things that you have done in less than one year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5482.264s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5482.844s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's a lot of community time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5484.424s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's a lot of learning for yourself and growth as a superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5491.846s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I have to comment, though, most directly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5495.174s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: is that your ownership of where we actually are and naming where we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5500.056s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: In order to move forward, we have to acknowledge where we are, our strengths and our weaknesses, and our areas of growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5507.599s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I respect that and appreciate that in this report and in you as a person as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5515.622s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: At this time, I would like to look towards the mayor to talk to her about the beginning, because there's less<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5522.088s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: There's between 40 and 45 school days left to this year, this school year, and then we're out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5529.05s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know 45 school days from today I think is like June 17th, so like we're right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5534.972s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We're right there between 40 and 45.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5537.253s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's really not a lot of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5540.133s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So as a committee, we're required to do a review of our superintendent, an annual review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5547.556s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'm gonna look to the mayor to start the process so that way we can,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5552.618s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: give feedback of what we've seen for this year, positive, and our future goals for you as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5560.543s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And since you brought this forward, I thought it was an appropriate time to start that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5566.126s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So there's a motion to, I don't know if I have to motion or if I just recommend it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=538.121s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We didn't get a hard copy of that, and we usually do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=541.103s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I didn't have a chance to look through that at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=543.525s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: If there's any questions, can I ask them at the next meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=547.508s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Would you like to table it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=549.93s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: No, I'm sure they need to be approved to be paid, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=554.654s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Oh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=555.935s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Do you need approval tonight to pay those?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=558.196s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=559.397s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And if the, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=562.366s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: OK, so can we table that so we can just look at them before we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=583.679s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=583.86s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: DiBenedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=584.921s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=585.381s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm hoping if there's anybody in the community that needs to speak first, but I've received a few phone calls and emails about a few issues and I'd like to bring them up under this community participation section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=605.119s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Well, I could at least bring up the ideas that were brought forward to me so we can put them on the agenda for next week and deliberate at that time, so at least they're brought forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=614.887s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: First was a concern about the gymnastic floor, and I'm requesting an update on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=621.371s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I heard that there was some kind of presentation at the city council meeting last week, and that there was a work order requested for either the floor or some equipment, and that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=635.198s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because of what was said at that meeting, the gymnastic room has been closed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=641.46s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And we're not using it as a school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=644.481s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And community schools aren't using it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=646.182s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So the little cute little three-year-olds I see when I go to Zuma on Saturday mornings aren't there and able to use it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=651.684s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'm just wondering if an inspection has been completed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=655.125s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's scheduled for this week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=656.665s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=657.246s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And so could we get a follow-up at our next meeting of where we are?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=661.763s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: maybe even an email if that's able to open prior to our next meeting, that would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=669.005s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'd like to add that to the next agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=671.526s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The other item is, I got a call about using drain fields for our middle school children for softball, and that the field is gonna be permitted to the middle school<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=689.44s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And there might be some conflict with the youth baseball program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=697.311s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: If anybody has some information on that, is our middle school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=715.346s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So it's girls youth softball using it, because the information I got today that it was the middle school club or middle school was using it for a youth softball team in that they were permitted the use of it after the youth little league already got permitted for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=736.775s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So if maybe we could get a report from either the middle school teachers or the Hormel commissioner, or whoever, if Bobby Maloney is the person who takes care of the Hormel, or whoever takes care of scheduling it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=752.989s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Hormel commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=753.689s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=754.39s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Hormel commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=755.25s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: If they could report to us at our next meeting and confirm that it's not through the schools, it's through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=761.336s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The youth programs, just to clarify because I was informed today that it was under<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=769.228s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: the middle school program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=787.962s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So could we have the commission come forward and just assure us that or send us a letter saying that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=794.44s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It has nothing to do with the school district pulling permits for that field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=799.682s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that's my second request for the item for the agenda for next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=804.825s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I just was wondering if there were any issues with the traffic due to the bridge closing in Somerville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=813.048s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Any updates on how that affected our Columbus school parents and our children on buses getting to and from school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2555.652s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2556.832s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2557.452s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Could you just explain to people how this works for people who are watching from home?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2561.994s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Like, is it an after school program?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2564.334s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: How does it affect their day at school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2566.64s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: how many children, how children are selected, is it to open to all children, you know, regardless of that child's needs, just a little bit more about it, a little bit more basics, so people tuning in tonight that haven't really, are seeing the growth, especially in our elementary schools, get a clearer understanding of what we're offering and what our purpose is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2832.221s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: All right, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3073.207s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Wow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3139.812s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Daniel Gross?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3596.904s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3598.405s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Not only do I agree that we've had great successes, and we're seeing more and more of our students in MEDFED,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3606.245s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: take advantage of these learning opportunities both in school and out of school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3611.089s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We had the CCSR group here today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3613.651s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But when it comes down to send these children, there's a lot of pressure on these families and these groups to raise the money to be able to go to these events.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3622.878s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I would hate to take anything away from books, pencils, paper that was budgeted for in a different way to help fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3633.087s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And it would be terrible if we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3635.118s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: came down to it and didn't have the funds available for our students to take part in these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3639.961s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I second what my colleague is saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3642.542s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It will be a priority for me throughout the budget process, and it will be one of my top priorities to make sure that every child that gets to that point shouldn't have to worry about how they get there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3655.049s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They're representing MedFed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3657.29s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: All I want to say is good luck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3659.231s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Bring home the whole big awards,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3663.077s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: the shiny trophies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3664.357s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Do your best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3666.538s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And while you're at it, be yourself, because if they see how you are here, if you present that way there, your glow will shine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3683.361s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Give them all the codes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3684.442s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3723.235s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=3278.718s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Can I waive that report being read and take item number two, report on upcoming MBTA role closures as priority?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=3294.896s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Motion on the floor for suspension of the rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=3296.978s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=3321.758s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm not doing mine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4476.16s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know we spoke the other night at the open house for the Green Line extension and all the road closures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4482.984s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: My concern is with the rerouting of a lot of this traffic is on Main Street and the Columbus School I spoke to you about is a few blocks away from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4493.209s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'm worried.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4494.15s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: First, we talked about the backup, and I'm glad that you addressed that with Kirstine<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4499.77s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: the school buses and our parents being directed so that they can drop off their children in a safe, appropriate way and not get stuck in the commuter traffic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4509.477s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But my other concern is how many of our students walk to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4514.02s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I'm not so much concerned on Main Street, it's just those people that go into the back streets to get around the traffic and the frustration level of the drivers in that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4524.427s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I just want maybe an announcement made to our families from the Columbus School<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4529.163s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: that this change is happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4530.524s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: There'll be a traffic change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4531.905s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Please advise your children to be more aware of cars in the neighborhood, as well as having our police force updated with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4542.171s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I didn't get a chance to talk to the chief the other night regarding this issue, but some of our students do walk in those neighborhoods, especially our fifth graders that may walk by themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4552.497s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I don't want them to come between two cars<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4556.05s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: an aggravated driver going long way down the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4598.622s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Dr. Kaye to actually send an announcement to families just to be aware.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4602.706s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So they're not, so there's a lot of people aren't really wondering what's going on in Somerville with bridge closures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4609.353s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So it's just a new awareness for those families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4612.937s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4943.467s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4944.067s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: DiBenedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4947.37s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: First of all, I would like to make a motion to approve the calendar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4950.172s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But also, I would like this calendar as well as the last day of school put up on the website so people are very clear as to how early our last day of school is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4962.415s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: due to the fact that a lot of camps don't open that early.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4966.276s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I don't know what we have scheduled for our summer fun camp, but having such an early estimated last day of school, maybe we could talk to people about even services throughout the city, recreation programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4983.121s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We need this communicated throughout so parents aren't left without care for their children in an unusual year like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4991.615s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So those two motions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5066.926s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: First meeting for our community<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5069.715s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It was Diane Caldwell, Assistant Associate Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5073.717s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Kathy Medaglio, Director of Pupil Services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5076.418s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Neil Osbon, Director of Diversity and Inclusion for the City of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5080.699s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Bernadette Riccidelli, Director of Curriculum and Instruction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5084.061s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Anthony Petrellis, Director of Summer Fund Program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5087.442s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Alec Luric, a parent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5089.303s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Toni Wray, Supervisor of Health Services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5091.964s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Megan Fidler-Carey, Director of Medford Before and After School Program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5098.427s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Kate Quinn,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5099.429s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Method Recreational Department, Emily Lazzaro, Executive Assistant to the Superintendent, and thank you for taking the notes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5107.056s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Dr. Marice Edouard-Vincent, Superintendent of Schools, Tanya Sullivan, CPAC Co-Chair, Melanie McLaughlin, CPAC Co-Chair, Patricia Kane, Della Grace, that's Dr., from Lesley University, Beverly Evelance,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5124.258s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Evans from Lesley University, Lauren Carlin, ETL from the Andrews Public School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5131.164s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Our committee had two focuses for this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5134.026s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: One is out-of-school time, and the second is disability awareness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5138.79s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: At this meeting, we were focusing on out-of-school time planning and coordination for vacations and summer programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5146.825s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We started by describing our current programs, our before and after school program, our summer fun camp, and the city recreational program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5154.79s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We discussed staffing and training for all staff and what types of accommodations are made for students with disabilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5162.234s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Before and after school program has a wait list and suggestions were made to work with Lesley University to try to fill<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5170.24s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: some staffing needs so we can move that wait list along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5173.962s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Also a great idea was to have CCSR and honor students from Medford High School to volunteer to help the program more often.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5184.406s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The summer fund camp was discussed and the idea of an earlier registration for programs so we can meet the needs and numbers of the campers<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5193.119s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: was also discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5194.36s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Three-tiered pricing for early registration, regular registration, and late registration was offered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5201.606s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: A handbook is being created for the staff, one for staff and one for families, so everybody has all the information necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5211.233s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And it's clear how our summer fund clamp runs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5214.416s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We have an EMT on staff, a nurse distributing medications, but training for the staff has been minimal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5221.351s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We are working to increase that option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5224.475s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The camp does not ever turn anyone away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5227.698s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They do their best to accommodate all needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5230.301s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Even if a parent needs last minute registration, no child has ever been turned away from the camp.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5238.283s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Students with disability may qualify for ESL in order to maintain and not lose social emotional skills during the summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5246.206s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: IEPs of those students are shared with the camp administration by our special education department in early June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5253.75s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They're changing the registration form to encourage all participants' parents to provide IEPs and 504s for any student coming to the camp.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5264.634s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So we're able to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5266.705s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: prepare for every student's need and make accommodations when necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5272.627s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Method Recreation is also present at the meeting and they have a staff member who has a long history of working with students with disabilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5279.929s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They are open to attend any trainings offered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5283.31s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It felt like it was a very productive meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5286.471s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Many steps have been taken already to improve our programming and our communications with families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5293.148s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The meeting minutes have been attached to these notes as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5297.552s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Any questions, please let us know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=6752.897s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=6753.938s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So this is really good data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=6756.439s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Even though a small variable or, you know, different kids or different classes or different people taking the test at different times, it gives us a broad area of which areas, like, which concepts in math we're stronger at and which ones we aren't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=6777.667s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I like seeing some of this data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=6781.557s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But I don't know if this is broken down by subgroups and what groups of students need more time, more attention, more tutoring for these types of evaluations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=6797.442s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'm just wondering if you have that data that might be beneficial for people, for us to make future determinations on what subgroups might need, if they need more time,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=6811.502s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: If they need more practice, if they need more facilitators giving the exam or small groups or whatever, we just want to make sure that those students are also progressing and are successful in this and have every opportunity to be successful in this way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=6830.697s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So for future reference, some subgroup information when this is presented would be helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9182.751s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9183.131s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9184.132s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9185.193s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I want to thank you for the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9188.476s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm very excited about the new science program, I'm sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9192.86s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Other members are thrilled that we're going to be getting that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9196.582s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But I also would like, not for this report, but in future reports, subgroup categories as well as school categories, just to make sure that all of our subgroups are meeting similar benchmarks to our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9214.408s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: to each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9215.568s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And also, CUSP scores.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9217.969s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know all of you present CUSP scores, and I know that that data is important and informative for planning purposes, but I also want to know, I want people to know, yeah, we were two or three questions away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9230.792s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't want to, not that you are, because I don't think you are, but in general, in past years, it was like, oh, but we were so close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9239.052s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We want to name what we are so we can move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9243.756s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't want to get too tied up on CUSP scores, like we're almost there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9247.439s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I want to use it for data purposes to build and think, but I also want to acknowledge this is what we are and own what we are, so that way we make concrete steps to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=11779.995s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=11780.755s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Domenico.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=11782.076s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just want to thank you all for presenting the MCAS data in this way and unpacking all of this data and bringing it down to our classrooms and our teachers so that way they're making informed choices of how they're presenting to our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=11800.544s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It seems like a lot of information that doesn't go anywhere, but it actually is very important work and even though we're<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=11810.015s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's late for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=11811.256s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I mean, the data you provide is very important for us moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=11815.8s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Again, subgroup information is something that I like to see, and I don't like to hear the cusps, because we didn't make those benchmarks, so I don't like announcing, well, if we did a little bit better, then we would have got 78%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=11832.274s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's just not my favorite thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=11841.145s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We almost got a 78, but you didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=11843.166s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But we didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=11844.066s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=11844.506s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I like to put out exactly what we did so people remember the accurate numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=11850.029s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's just a personal thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=11851.429s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't know if other members feel the same way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1303.509s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So, thank you for submitting the bills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1306.873s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: On page 5 of 11, halfway down, it says a person's name, Smith Lena, and it says foreign language textbooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1321.014s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That makes sense then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1323.395s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: On page 7 of 11 and the beginning of 8 of 11, there is a repetitive payment to a person for professional services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1334.943s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I saw it throughout the billing thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1336.904s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Is that an employee, or is that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1347.775s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Which evening school program would that be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1352.056s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1357.317s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Is that similar with, on page 9 of 11, fourth one up, another employee by the last name of Kirby, and the amount is $1,538?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1377.398s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And then my last question is the last page, second from the last.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1382.9s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's just a large amount for McGlynn Middle School miscellaneous items for $5,900.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1399.43s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It just, it just seems greater than it usually have for that amount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1403.713s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you for the answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1404.794s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1405.434s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=2168.102s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=2343.604s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=2344.085s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: DiBenedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=2345.165s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=2345.805s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I was wondering if you could send us a copy of the winning essays and poems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=2352.268s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We like to see those as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3070.514s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3072.635s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3074.136s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I've had the privilege of spending some time with Hunter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3079.499s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't know if you remember.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3080.5s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3081.06s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I was shopping at the store and I took a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3085.943s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I was posting pitches.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3087.224s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I was trying on all different types of merchandise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3090.165s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Do you remember?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3093.187s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I was there and it was so great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3095.088s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I encourage everybody in the community to buy some of the outfits that they have at the vocational school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3104.351s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I love them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3106.512s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I wear them every Saturday, everywhere I go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3109.473s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Especially the sweatpants with the little zip at the bottom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3114.774s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So comfy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3115.615s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's like pajamas you can wear outside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3117.275s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: In the half zip pullover that says Medford, in the red t-shirt, because we had to search for the right color.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3124.917s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And the red one really pops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3126.577s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I wasn't sure at first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3127.917s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But I'm telling you, I spent a long, long time with Hunter and a wonderful teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3134.219s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I had a lot of fun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3135.559s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I learned a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3136.539s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And the program is expanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3140.961s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I have great ideas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3143.261s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Your number on my bulletin board at home, so that way I can tell everybody where to go and how to get there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3148.364s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And thank you for all your service, and keep selling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3151.206s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Whatever you do, keep selling, because you- Your skills that you've learned here are going to carry you forward very well, and we're very proud of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3329.703s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Can we send a letter of thanks to Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3332.624s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Gomez?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3334.664s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: She's an excellent teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3336.084s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: She was actually one of my children's teachers years ago, and she does a great job for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3343.605s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: pay for learning for our staff members is greatly appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3350.248s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3350.729s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think that's a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5436.689s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Do we have to make those changes and That can we mend it to make sure that this paper reflects the amount of students from a proper number Yes, we make that as an amendment to approval of this item also<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5456.469s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I would like to request an update on that fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5462.319s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: How many outside students we actually have coming in from different districts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5467.428s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5516.807s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5634.654s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: First of all, I have no problem going for this to go to subcommittee because I happen to be on the subcommittee if I wasn't I Would want to be at all of these meetings because the budget is one of our main priorities as a school committee member We oversee the budget and we oversee the superintendent so<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5655.078s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I really feel like I'd support anybody who's not on this committee feeling necessary to attend these meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5662.446s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I do have a problem with the date of April 4th and possibly some other dates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5668.472s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So, other than the exact dates, if that could be changed, I'd like to hear from other committee members and make sure that the scheduled time frame works for them as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6597.487s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6599.168s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Kathy, Paula and I both want to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6619.613s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think that having the back and forth, the spirit of it is excellent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6624.858s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It can just be executed instead of the subcommittee, but just do it as a committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6629.582s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Still do exactly what you're talking about with these dates or similar dates, you know, and just continue forward with this plan, but just increase the amount of members present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6643.326s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think that the idea is excellent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6645.127s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think having knowledge about this and having that back and forth is wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6650.509s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I'll appreciate having all that knowledge when we go to vote on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6655.21s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But I do think that, as an elected official, we're elected to do those small things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6660.272s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And if I wasn't on this committee, I would be upset by not being on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=7851.489s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We received a report on the Manfred High School Student Activity Account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=7858.29s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Could we add this to the next agenda just so I could ask a few questions to it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=7862.992s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=812.937s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=813.898s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=815.219s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just wanted to speak of all of the different programs that Judy herself has run through for this city throughout many, many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=828.79s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I've learned a lot from her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=830.672s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: She has a great sense of humor, and she outworks me every single day, as well as most of her crew, like Rosemary and the audience and many others that join her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=841.22s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They are here tirelessly working on this event and many others that raise money not only for our schools, but like our Alzheimer's Center, our Memory Loss Center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=853.562s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They do phenomenal work, and I am gonna join the group someday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=858.363s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I keep saying it, I don't know when that is, but I... I have great respect, thank you for all you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=2796.665s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=2797.766s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=2799.447s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So having done your second set of learning walks, do you notice,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=2808.05s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know that we've encouraged, as a committee and through our administrators, to make sure that every school has the same opportunity for growth and is on the same...they're learning the same things across the district, and that one school isn't doing something differently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=2828.982s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: consistency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=2988.722s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I just had one more question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=2990.963s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I saw the EL director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=2994.465s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes, as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=2996.186s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Right, and I'm wondering if our special education department was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=3001.644s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: present during the learning walks and if they're planning on being a bigger part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=3006.529s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And do we go into small group settings that are also supposed to be learning, like pull-out classes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=3073.867s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It looked great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4273.662s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4275.183s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4277.204s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I had the opportunity to speak to the superintendent about this prior to her presenting this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4285.648s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think this is a very fair way to make sure that both schools have equal opportunity for all students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4296.933s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I wholeheartedly support this idea, and I also<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4301.418s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I would like to talk to the superintendent about an idea that she had when she interviewed with the school committee about the possibility of having one school be a fifth, sixth grade building, and the other school be a seventh, eighth grade building, so that the children are merging, starting in fifth grade and become one group, one class moving forward from that point on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4324.57s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So, I would like to make a motion on the floor to give<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4328.829s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: the superintendent time a few years to look at that and maybe whatever contracts we have to change with teachers or to put a team together to move our district forward in that manner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4345.97s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I'm looking for support from my other members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5496.136s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5498.887s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just want to remind people when the new schools were built, part of the charter, the request to build the new schools was based on diversity in those buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5514.585s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I know we received funding for those schools because of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5517.967s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Racial balance plan we had to enact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5520.128s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It was a really important piece of our new schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5524.31s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I know they're not new anymore, and we don't receive federal funds anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5528.832s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But the idea, the reason we received it, because it was such a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5532.874s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And if we lost that along the way, we maybe need to renew that at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5541.183s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I mean, as everybody knows, I do work at a charter school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5544.745s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And there's students from all different socioeconomic backgrounds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5551.687s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And the diversity goes up and down depending on the year and how many families love it and apply for their children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5562.432s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I've been there for 24 years and seen those ups and downs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5566.714s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And we're seeing that a little bit right now with our middle schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5570.205s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It used to be McGlynn was the school to go to when my children were going to middle school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5575.848s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And then it was the Andrews, and it would bounce back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5579.469s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But I don't know if we ever stopped and looked at it so deeply and see the lasting effects of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5589.974s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So this is our opportunity to make sure that all children are given every opportunity<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5600.385s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: for the best education and to be surrounded by all different types of people in their school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5607.208s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I don't want to lose this opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5609.709s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think starting now, February, by doing a mailing, doing a phone call, maybe doing a meeting at each elementary school for fifth grade class night or whatever, whichever way we do it, if we do all of those things and make sure we do great outreach and we just, you know, I'm sure the superintendent will<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5630.273s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think it will be fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5630.873s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm sure we'll plot a plan with the other administrators and say when we do, you know, open houses at both buildings just so parents can see both buildings, they should still do those because your child's going to be going to a different building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5644.704s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And at those opportunities, just remind people that there is a new way of how we're doing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5651.569s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Just get the word out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5653.93s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think it will be fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5655.051s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm sure that there will be some areas or some students that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5660.523s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: not with their friends and, you know, we can handle things as they come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5666.525s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I mean, change is always a little bit hard, but then it's the new way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6170.945s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I wanted to get up and clap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8424.3s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8425.22s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8425.62s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I had two comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8428.142s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: First of all, I would like to see at some point this incorporated to every child's IEP meeting, so that way parents have input of what the needs are for their children, because no one knows their child better than a parent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8442.078s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I would also like to include all students that are old enough or are able to communicate to be able to have some input of what works best for them in these drafts and maybe on the committee as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8460.311s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I really feel like if you incorporated people with disabilities onto a committee that is so significant and we all learn,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8485.735s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Or at lunch when students are at lunch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8504.005s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I can envision that this being really helpful at any IEP meeting to have parents even aware of just starting to think about it prior to coming to a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8516.093s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And not only for our district, but throughout the state of Massachusetts and maybe the country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8520.797s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So children with disabilities, that this is on people's radar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8526.382s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because when you receive services, you get a lot of communication from schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8533.267s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And you have different touch points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8535.269s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Like you might have your school liaison call you and introduce themselves at the beginning of the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8540.173s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And then you have your IEP meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8541.774s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You have more opportunity to reach those parents and talk to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8545.338s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I think that that input is significant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8549.04s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Not only does the school providing that, but it worked in both ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8586.444s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8596.687s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So moved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8660.12s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=36.17s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: In the minutes we talked about our having I believe a committee of the whole I don't know if it's in the minutes on health and I was wondering if the committee wanted to go to Zumba before we have that committee meeting and just get a little workout and get our blood flowing I was at Zumba up the high school and I spoke the instructor and she'd be she'd love to have us all so<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=61.028s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: When we schedule that, if we want to do that, I thought it would be, since it's about health and movement, it would be a fun way for us to all have a good time together and then sit and talk about the health of our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=102.913s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=107.176s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So on page 2 of 21, the top three items,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=114.855s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The item, the vendor name is Amici's Pizza, and the account description is building repairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=126.562s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: When I was reading it over the weekend, I'm like, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=131.445s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, that's great if that's how we're paying for building repairs and upgrades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=144.295s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It lines down, it says professional technical services education and it lists a Mr. Lino.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=152.821s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I keep seeing his name throughout the... Yes, it's the evening school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=161.767s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=162.588s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: On page 14 of 21.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=173.92s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Sorry for jumping around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=175.121s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm just trying to get acclimated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=179.124s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Three quarters of the way down, in the amount of $6,877 and $4,776, it says Trustees of Boston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=198.421s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=199.802s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=204.639s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I believe that's all of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=206.2s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=208.361s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Roll call vote, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=211.283s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=359.146s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=359.986s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=361.408s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I read through the policies, and I really like a lot of the updates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=365.21s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: There is something that I came across with a parent<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=369.414s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: recently that I'd like to see added, and that is a school nurse may not consult with the student's physician and get medication orders without parental permission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=400.531s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=400.771s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Clarification is one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=402.712s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Getting a different order from a doctor without a parent being notified is a major issue that I feel that this needs to be added, that parental permission for any, you know, changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=419.599s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Like a nurse is calling a pediatrician.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=422.841s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Getting a change in a child's medication order or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=428.55s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And not notifying a parent is not appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=432.313s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And so therefore, I want to make sure parental notification is either given prior to that phone call or after that phone call that an order has been changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=443.681s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because in this situation, the parent was never notified of the change from her child's physician to the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=455.13s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: No, I think it should be a policy on this document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=458.396s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I don't think it's a conversation privately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=460.697s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It should never have happened to any parent to find out in a meeting in that it should be part of this policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=467.038s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And there is a motion on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=471.319s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Under Medication Orders, Parental Consent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=479.341s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=488.137s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Page one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=501.088s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: A consent to administer medication, but not to call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=505.592s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, to administer it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=507.054s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But this particular situation was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=510.138s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: the nurse called the doctor, the order was changed after that conversation and the parent was never notified that they called the doctor or that an order was changed and the parent got no notification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=524.627s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I want that addressed in this policy since we're reviewing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=529.049s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't think that any parent would want the school nurse to change their child's orders with their doctor and not be notified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=553.609s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Oh, it absolutely is, because we're talking about policy changes in this department at this meeting, and that's something that I had firsthand knowledge of happening, and it should be addressed in these policies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=607.04s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Actually, I'm asking to amend the policy and add that a school nurse may not consult with the student's physician and get medication orders or changes without parental permission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=620.667s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I want that in section E. Section what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=623.869s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: E.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=690.487s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I remove my amendment and again ask it to go to subcommittee, so that way the wording is correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=700.252s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Right, but I don't want the document<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=702.638s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: approved until this issue is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=704.338s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=704.899s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4025.653s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4027.174s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4028.354s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4029.655s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I see your concerns, my colleagues' concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4033.737s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We just want to make sure that there is no reason that any student's not participating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4041.44s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I also worry about the small group that's going to be left at the Andrews and what they'll be doing with their time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4048.623s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Well, it's a weekend trip, but on that Friday, as long as they don't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4053.058s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: you know, is that community everybody's been reached out to to make sure that they're welcome to go on the trip?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4079.262s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4081.002s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: My other question is insurance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4082.903s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I didn't see it listed here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4084.383s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Insurance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4086.304s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: As part of the fee involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4089.545s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We did have to cancel one of these trips at one point because of things going on in the world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4095.066s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And as a committee, we voted to make sure that parents didn't lose money and the district helped out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4100.707s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But we made it so that way every trip from that point on had to cover insurance in case that were to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4121.814s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So for cancellation, if the school committee decides that it's for any reason not safe to send our children to another state as that trip comes closer, that is covered, and the parents will receive all of their money back?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4143.592s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4147.473s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know it might add to the ultimate cost of every child.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4152.015s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4152.315s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But it is a policy to make sure that that is added to every trip, because we had to cancel at one point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4160.078s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And it was a financial hardship for some parents to lose their deposits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4165.42s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And the school system did step up in that occasion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4170.571s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Do you need this approval tonight, or could you get us those answers before we approve this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4177.612s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Or we can approve it and just make sure that that policy is adhered to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4523.369s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: This field trip's been going on for years and years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4528.373s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's great for our students to get out in the environment and to do some science hands-on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4535.298s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think it's a great learning opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4537.84s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Again, I would like to make sure that all students have the opportunity to take part in it, regardless of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4545.506s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: of their financial situations, and I make a motion at this time to approve and move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4613.871s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: There's a second by Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4855.63s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4856.731s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4857.811s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: First of all, I would like to thank you very much for putting this together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4861.353s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know it was just added to your duties recently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4865.195s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So there's a lot of non-<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4867.744s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: PTO 5013Cs that aren't listed here, like Friends of Baseball, Friends of Soccer, Friends of those, all of those organizations raise money using Method Public Schools' name, and they're required, based on what this committee voted on, to, in order to be able to do that, is to register.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4894.171s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: have we reached out to those groups, and if so, have they answered us at all?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4956.207s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Also, what type of information other than what's right in front of us are we collecting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4961.81s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because I know the superintendent, I'm not sure if she was here when the original, it was an online form developed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4971.774s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't know if you've received that and that's what we're currently using.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4977.638s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: areas of who's the head of your organization, who's the president, who's the vice president?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4983.723s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Are we getting all of that information from these?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4986.466s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: As well as, do you have a bank account?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4988.467s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Who's on the bank account?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4989.708s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Like, we wanted specific details.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4992.371s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I don't know if that's been provided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5051.69s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So what about the organizations raising money using Method Public Schools that aren't, that haven't done the 5013Cs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5061.878s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: How will we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5068.223s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You know, authorize those groups to raise money using our names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5072.887s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I mean, that, you know, there was this legitimate concern for the development of this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5280.692s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: My question is, so say a coach decides to run a three-week-long camp.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5288.558s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You can pay at the door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5289.659s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Does that go through community schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5291.541s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Is that going through this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5294.043s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: How are we regulating these funds?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5297.359s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I see it on Facebook all the time, oh, we're running this event, come and pay at the door cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5302.643s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And like, is that money going through the school district or is it going to that subgroup and how will we manage?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5310.049s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's just too big of an opportunity for money to be used differently than what intended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5365.849s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So when I see, oh, you can pay at the door, like, there's a lot of cash being handled at the door if there's, you know, 60 kids coming to, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5380.763s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: a training for a day with specific coaches, and then, like, wouldn't that be the community school's desk that that fund should be going out of and not necessarily up at the door by... No, again, so there's different mechanisms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5429.687s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So what had happened, and most of you had known this, but I'm not sure the superintendent did, is that people were<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5438.529s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: charging our students for private lessons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5443.933s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And instead of paying our school district to use the building, they were paying the Friends of account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5451.738s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So the facilities were being used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5507.168s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The schedules are reviewed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5508.429s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Right, but also maybe we need a list of the activities groups so we have a clear picture of like, okay,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5514.284s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So these are activities groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5515.685s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Those funds go through this way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5517.605s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Certainly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5517.946s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: These are our 501 groups, and their funds go this way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5521.847s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And maybe we should see how that works, like, annually, just like, so we know how much funds are coming in, going out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5529.65s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I just want to tighten it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5531.551s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just don't want to go, I don't want what happened in the past to either continue or to happen again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5538.734s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It was, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5565.405s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5568.01s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5568.35s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think that this is bigger than we can just discuss here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5572.031s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Maybe this is a committee of the whole to, like, come up with, like, policies and procedures for people being able to collect money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5579.812s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We do have policies in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6019.668s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: One last question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6021.844s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6022.505s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The Method Foundation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6028.369s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's on there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6029.25s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6029.53s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6030.23s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Is that on the list?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6031.211s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's on the list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6032.212s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6033.093s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Oh, yeah, I didn't see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6034.293s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And my other point is when we get the friends of the activities accounts, we also need contact information for people in charge of those accounts as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6046.082s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We want the same information that we're getting for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6050.032s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: the PTOs and the non-profits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6052.893s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So they should fill out the paperwork in the same manner, whoever's the head of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6060.315s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: No, yeah, the friends of Method Soccer, the friends of Method Baseball, the friends of those, if they come up listed under activities, we need to know who's on those bank accounts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6077.535s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: All right, well, what about the groups that have those others that have their own bank accounts that aren't through the schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6085.739s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, but if they're not listed as a 501C3... We wouldn't accept that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6101.488s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And... Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6104.049s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Enforcement of groups that...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6107.697s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: or helping them get on to 501c3 is our next goal then, to make sure that all those groups are self-reporting, because it's mandated by the school district, by the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6204.543s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: With the amendment that we get a follow-up report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6684.987s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6686.368s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think this is an opportunity for the school committee to work collaboratively with the city council and ask them to join us with our efforts and ask them to provide a similar letter to our governor and our legislative people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6704.842s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So could we send a letter to our city council members and if you want any of us to go and speak<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6715.467s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: on behalf of them joining, I'm more than willing to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=625.294s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I motion to approve the payroll for this quarter, but I also have questions about the report presented and a request to have a little bit more information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=637.859s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: First of all, I want to thank you for presenting it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=641.167s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: When we asked for this quarterly, I know it was a long time ago, we asked for the job title and the annual salaries be listed next to the gross for the pay period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=665.02s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=667.862s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The job descriptions can be added?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=671.463s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because I remember the last one, we would say, it doesn't say what, like some people have four paid checks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=703.694s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know, but I know it can be downloaded to an Excel document, and those job descriptions can be there, because you have people's names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=710.296s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Like, some people get four paychecks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=712.503s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I know some of its longevity, but I don't know what the other things are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=717.088s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So, you know, and we are supposed to be able to look at this and look at our budget book to see if we're on track, and that's really the goal here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=727.039s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I would just like to table this so I can check my notes from the last meeting and the formal request that I made at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=735.063s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And if that's OK, should we table in this report?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1833.845s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You're all set.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1834.585s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1835.605s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1837.006s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So as my colleague was saying about taking 30 random names, last year that's exactly what I had done and compared it to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1846.955s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: the budget book and there were discrepancies in a few people's salaries and steps were given out of time frame that should have been and we had a meeting about it and that's why this report was requested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1865.091s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But this document doesn't give us enough information and that's why I'm asking to table it<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1870.887s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: so we can get more information than what's presented at this time in a way that we can, you know, just pick a few things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1878.028s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: If every one of us picked three and just said, you know, my three were great, then, you know, we're doing our due diligence in moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1886.87s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that's all I want to see happen, and I want to ask a few questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1894.771s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Like some principals are supposed to be making the same<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1898.397s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: amount of money we made changes at the beginning of that this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1901.419s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And if you look at those two principles, they're not on this base salary in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1907.324s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I don't want to do all of that on camera for the whole city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1912.087s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't think it's fair to name names in someone's salary all the time in this forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1917.351s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'd like to table it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1919.672s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'd like a little bit more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1921.474s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'd like to look at my notes because they may be different from what you had written down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1927.873s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I definitely need a little bit more information than what's presented in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1932.517s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2893.652s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2893.972s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: DiBenedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2895.353s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you, Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2896.794s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: First, going back to the in plain sight thing, maybe an auto call to just both middle schools, like the night before, as a reminder to parents that this program is happening, just to say, hey, while you're bringing your children to the dance, or for the other school as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2917.658s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: that we'd love to see you and it's a great opportunity to mingle with other middle school parents because they take the bus, you don't get to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2925.285s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that was one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2926.686s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Number two is I really like the superintendent updates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2932.691s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I gather a lot of information and it's really informative and not only to me as a committee member but I'm sure anybody watching.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2943.881s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: to just hear highlights of what's happening all over the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2947.203s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I really appreciate them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2948.764s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So take your time and do as long as you need to, because it's really, really fun for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2955.088s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Not that you needed that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2957.449s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And then I forget what the third thing was, so I'll just pass the floor along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2963.233s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3125.372s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3125.953s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I remembered what my other item was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3130.433s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Priscilla's Pantry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3132.194s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I love the name too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3134.897s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So how many children attended that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3138.223s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And, you know, like how many people are we serving?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3141.364s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Do we have any numbers yet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3142.425s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know it's early, but, and I also, I think I requested a number of like how many homeless families or students we're serving in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3152.068s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't know if we have a, glad that I asked for that a couple weeks, maybe a month ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3158.07s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3159.21s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Just, I don't know if we could know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3161.891s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3163.032s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I work with homeless population at the school district I work at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3167.366s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So this time of year, all through the year, more and more families and children are having difficult time paying their rent and becoming homeless.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3179.054s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So things like Priscilla's Pantry, I'm very happy to see our school district, you know, take initiative with that stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3187.539s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And just some follow-up, like just some understanding of this population that we're serving is helpful to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3201.17s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3201.89s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm just curious how many homeless families or homeless students that this district is serving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3206.511s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And you can probably find that by the homeless transportation numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3211.913s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That would give you an estimate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3218.734s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Oh, OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3219.154s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I didn't realize that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3221.9s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think it's great, the fact that you're teaching them how to cook and be independent people is very impressive to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3228.247s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I was just curious how many people we're serving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3231.41s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I want to know what it starts at so then as we watch it grow we can say, remember there was 8 kids and now there's 80 kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3526.541s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3526.742s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: DiBenedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3527.442s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3528.483s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: This is great, a good way to welcome families into their first experience with our school district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3537.409s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just have a few questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3539.051s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Will interpreters be present at any of the open house?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3551.145s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3551.946s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That represents the Neenah community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3554.268s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Also, I'm wondering if the registration office, the Parent Information Center, is going to have more staffing this year, later hours, and interpreters available, because last year there were some needs of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3571.415s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: families that came to my attention?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3602.615s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That was my next question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3603.896s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3619.479s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'm more curious about the Parent Information Center and when parents need to access that and if there's any way we can streamline that and be really prepared<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3630.055s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: for new families to make it as easy for them as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3634.279s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because for some families, getting up to the high school is difficult back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3641.685s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And if they have to go repeatedly because they forgot paperwork or they don't understand everything, a few families ran into that last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3654.215s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3666.481s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: As long as there's interpreters and health person there that can help them with the health documents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3672.565s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And we're very clear in our packets of what they need to bring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3676.787s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And maybe staff more, because a lot of this information takes a while to process with each parent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3686.742s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So if there's only one person there, or if they step out for lunch, or to go to the bathroom, and if someone comes and it's not there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3885.023s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3886.803s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Getting back to the language that my colleague was talking about, about the after school program, there are some families that didn't even get added to a wait list at the beginning of this year when they tried to add their children on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3905.678s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'm not sure we are meeting the needs of our families in that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3910.901s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I would like a report or I would like some information on the numbers of students in the wait list for after school and before school programming so we can maybe start addressing the needs of the district in hiring<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3928.651s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3929.072s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know hiring is very difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3990.649s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just want to know what we need to meet the need of the current families on the wait list, even without worrying about kindergartners coming in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4008.238s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Ruggiero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4362.472s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Chaperone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4363.673s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Chaperone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4364.254s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: At every trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4371.32s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6124.754s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6126.735s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Have we reached out to our 5013Cs, our PTOs, our friends of, and told, informed them that they are required to register with the Medford Public Schools in order to utilize and fundraise using our... So again, we don't have all of their direct contact information and that's the purpose of gathering it at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6200.967s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Actually, what this committee voted was that it was mandatory for all, and it shouldn't say PTO training update, it should be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6210.683s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: 5013C, PTO, and Friends Of, because it's not that one small group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6216.085s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And we do, and I think our principals know a lot about who's raising money in these groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6225.048s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And we should be reaching out to contact them that they have a deadline to register with our online program through Emily, because a lot of them haven't, that I've talked to recently, haven't heard that they're supposed to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6240.017s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I think we need to do more because it was mandated by this body that it was a mandatory, it wasn't volunteer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6252.84s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I keep hearing that at updates and stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6255.341s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's not voluntary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6256.901s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: If you're going to do business and raise money using Medford Public Schools or students of Medford Public Schools in any way, shape, or form, you are to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6265.734s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: listed with us who is on your bank accounts, who is the president of your group, who is the contact person, and what their phone number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6273.257s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I mean, Janine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6276.618s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I understand, but the deadlines, they go hand in hand, and the deadline for that is soon, February 1st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6284.521s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So if we haven't started reaching out to them, we need to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6287.802s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: This is something I'm going to follow up on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6291.084s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And the people I have talked to haven't heard anything yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6295.472s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm not sure how extensive it goes to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6299.853s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just know that we need to take action and move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6304.935s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It was mandated by this body, and I want to see movement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6308.416s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I do know that there's supposed to be an update to us mid to late February as to how many people who have signed up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6325.209s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, and the groups I have talked to haven't even been informed that they're supposed to have this information to the school district as of yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6331.453s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that's the piece I'm concerned about at this point, because we're halfway through January, and they have a February 1st enrollment, and if they're not even aware they're supposed to, they have to pull those documents while they're doing their taxes for their 5013Cs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6347.865s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's why we gave it this deadline and this timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6354.238s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just hope that we can make this a priority in the next few weeks so that way we have that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=792.17s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's been a pattern for a while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=800.013s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I didn't flag it, so if I had a question, I'll come back to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=803.295s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=804.256s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=1763.416s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Just to let the superintendent know, the Carpentries Shop at the Medford High School for years has made bed frames for homeless families because when a homeless family gets housing,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=1777.052s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They cannot move in until they have a bed for every child.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=1780.474s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And when you're homeless and you're just starting out, you have nothing to fill that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=1785.437s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So our students have always built beds for people in our community in need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=1790.94s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I think there was a spotlight on them a few years ago about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=1795.563s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's just a wonderful, one of the wonderful programs that our vocational students reach out to and help people throughout the state of Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=1803.407s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I actually was telling a group that was looking to donate money<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=1806.962s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: to reach out to Chad Fallon to talk to them about maybe buying the mattresses if the kids could make the beds and really get people in housing quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=1819.318s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'm glad to see that they're continuing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=1821.921s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2022.641s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Could we send a letter of thank you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2215.812s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2217.213s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2218.514s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'd like to know who will actually hire and oversee this person since they're joint between the school and the city side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2247.275s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And my other question is, will the school security staff then report to this person?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2260.581s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4681.898s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4684.12s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I too wanted to thank the doctor for bringing this information forward to make sure that this paperwork is on our blogs and may be sent to our PTOs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4692.722s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So when they have parent meetings that the education is there for them to access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4701.065s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: As well as our students, I think especially at our high school level, maybe during health class or whatever classes, I'm not sure exactly how this is being presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4711.848s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But since it is a crisis that we need to stop now, we have to have strict policy in place<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4719.793s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: and be ready to help our children make better choices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4724.735s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Very strict, like we do for any other toxin ingested during the school day, social probation, and help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4736.74s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We recently received an email as a committee by a family in the district whose child was vaping and asked for our help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4745.623s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And our administration reached out to that person<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4749.739s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But if there's one, there's many.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4751.66s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And if we're getting one email, there's 100 children or families experiencing the same things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4758.862s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: My brother was an addict in high school and now is no longer living.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4763.664s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It was a different drug, and it took his life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4766.825s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I believe that this is just as dangerous as what he did, because I think the effects of inhaling chemicals that we don't even know are in those vapes into your lungs and into your body<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4780.538s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: that could have the potential to be lethal for some of our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4785.72s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I would hate to see a family go through what my family did because of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4790.922s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'm committed to working on this as a committee member and as a community member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4796.664s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I'm glad that you live in Method, because not that you wouldn't be invested, but that pulls you in even a little tighter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4803.246s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So through the next year, I'd like to have a committee, the health committee or a subcommittee,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4809.027s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: to really focus on our role as leaders in the community, not only in our schools, but in our community in general, and working with the city council and the mayor's office to make sure that our community is safe for our developing children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=6829.236s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: A policy for the superintendent, and I'll get this submitted to two, three to seven folks, so that, you know, when I'm, when a book comes out, for every parent, who's just dying next year, this is the policy, if your child's mom will be taking a class, right, and you're handling similar to a five or five series movie, then they are required to go through this program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=6889.488s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And if you're getting a school ticket and you've been logged in and you have three tickets, you're required on a Saturday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=6900.982s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: do you want to speak?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=6905.085s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You're on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=6911.609s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm sorry, I don't get to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=6928.203s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Video culture will go off whenever other toxins are going in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=6932.706s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I don't want to show people's lives later on because we don't know now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=6938.551s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And we have a program set up in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=6940.853s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I went to those community meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=7060.82s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=7088.066s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I need a second on the move up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8806.244s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8807.064s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8808.285s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you for this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8810.588s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So on page 3 of 10, and you might not have this answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8816.112s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The superintendent might help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8818.614s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It says halfway down the page for the amount of $14,500 and the line below it $14,982.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8828.517s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: instructional support staff for the Brooks and for the Columbus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8832.519s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Do we not hire that staff or has that position been left open for any reason?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8869.904s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: In the future, will those line up more?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8882.963s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8883.603s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Also, for the Brooks School Elementary textbooks, they still have a balance of $4,000, and the Roberts does as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8892.57s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The reason I say this is because last year at end of budget, some of the principals came forward and didn't realize there was a cutoff or didn't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8901.38s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: didn't know enough about their budget, maybe on their part or our part for not educating them, of where they have funds to spend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8911.349s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I just want to make sure that every principal has gone over their budget, knows that they have these funds to utilize for the year, make sure that they have what they need and are not holding back from providing supplies like textbooks or staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8937.12s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So the Roberts and the Brooks realizes they still have 4,000 each in books available for them to order for the school year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8949.402s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And last year we talked about sending a reminder email to all principals and department heads,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8957.668s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: around this time of year, so when you do your early cutoff so you can reconcile your books, that they have sufficient time to get their POs in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8966.076s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just want to make sure that they weren't... She said not when they're gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8970.02s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8970.541s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8972.663s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8973.484s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And then my other questions were...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8976.387s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Vocational pupil transportation, $15,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8980.728s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We hadn't utilized that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8981.888s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Is that additional savings for students no longer going to college?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9001.871s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Further down that page, again, was textbooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9006.758s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm going to move on from that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9009.379s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Math department office supplies haven't used their $500 allocation on page 7 of 10.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9020.741s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And then I noticed, like, computer teacher at the Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9059.384s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that explains a lot of it, excluding the library, aid, and Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9064.881s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: If that's probably a similar situation then?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9067.622s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9068.202s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And then the operation and maintenance secretary salary is also in that situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9077.985s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I don't know if it's allocated differently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9079.806s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Do we have a person in that position?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9110.548s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I mean, it used to be very hard to see a lot more of these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9115.13s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And a lot of the ones I had today, again, with salary, and we don't have that program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9119.855s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you for the information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9121.256s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's good to see that we're on track.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9123.198s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And my only concern was making sure all department heads' needs were met for this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9128.243s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9129.144s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9129.304s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Vandeclote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2247.142s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2248.363s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2250.163s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: This is my favorite night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2251.424s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: When we sat on meetings with beautiful music and all of you donating your time to play for us and the community, just really puts a big smile on my face.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2262.873s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I love to hear you all play, and it's especially important to me because this is one of the few times that we get to hear Mr. Zigny play as well, and he's not just conducting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2274.242s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So when I open the door and I heard the music, the minute you open the door, it goes all the way through City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2280.157s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It just puts a big smile on everybody's face.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2282.639s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And thank you for your time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2283.98s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And thank you for the parents for bringing your children here and sharing their talent with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2288.964s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2322.576s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: When I was looking through the minutes, I noticed that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2330.768s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Towards the back, we were talking about the 5013Cs and how the superintendent assigned her new executive assistant, Emily, to work that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2343.712s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I was wondering if we could add to that, and I don't know if it's allowed, to just give us a report at the end of February to just see how it's going and making sure she's not overwhelmed and, you know, just a little add-on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2357.703s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: if you don't mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2358.383s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2365.045s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, like who registered, how many left, and how much work it actually takes for our staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2388.539s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Seconded by Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2391.0s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mayor Burke, I just had a quick question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2392.741s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2394.262s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Of course, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2396.423s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Actually, it's on page 14 of 24, school committee dues, $247.98 to one member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2409.069s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm assuming it's for the conference, but I just want to make sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2414.395s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: 14 of 24, halfway down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2417.919s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The amount is $247.98.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3182.873s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3184.825s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I make a motion to accept this as is and revisit it in January and ask Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3189.929s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Ray to report on additional adding of other options for our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3406.84s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3407.201s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: DiBenedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3408.941s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I have to say I don't love number five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3412.883s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: If a school committee member acts in a fashion that is unbecoming, may be subject to censure by two-thirds of the vote of the body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3420.847s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Well, what items are unbecoming?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3422.587s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Who decides that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3423.948s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Like, that just can be anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3427.129s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And censure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3429.623s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't report to my fellow members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3431.864s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I report to the people who voted for me to be their voice at this seat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3438.106s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And so I would pull off item five totally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3445.568s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I wouldn't sign off on this document with that on there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3451.65s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I think people would have a hard time censoring me anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3456.232s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Good luck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3460.84s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: because that's my job as a committee member is to speak my mind for the people who are elected me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3466.183s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And if other people get a right to censor what I say or find that what I say is unbecoming because they don't like it for any way, shape, or form, or my attitude, or the way that I might present it, or how passionate I am about an issue, I think is very dangerous to put in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3484.311s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I think it would be so impossible to regulate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3488.204s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because I think you know me for eight years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3491.107s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm hot enough to regulate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3492.429s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's just not going to work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4212.838s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto, does two items on up, I second having the meet and greet on February, would have a day that, is it actually Valentine's Day?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4229.017s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: OK, so at the Valentine's Day social that the Method Family Network provides, I second the motion on the floor for us to have that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4243.769s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4774.496s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4775.516s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4778.536s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Under community participation, I got a note from the daughter of Lena DeGentema, so regarding the event we had, those of you who don't know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4790.715s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We named the music room the Gigentmaso Music Room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4796.978s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Oh, good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4798.659s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So from her daughter, she just wrote, Erin, thank you again for the wonderful evening last night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4804.002s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The ceremony that the district provided was truly humbling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4811.626s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And my mom loved this dedication more than words could tell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4816.8s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you for a wonderful, memorable night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4819.322s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And please tell Lisa Evangelista we realize how much time and effort she put into the event.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4825.507s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6169.899s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6170.139s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Domenedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6171.62s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Was part of the reason you chose the interior courtyard because of the deer that come out in the evening?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6179.286s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And now the bear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6209.31s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I really like the idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6210.57s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think it's going to look beautiful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6212.011s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And that courtyard needed a little sprucing up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6215.651s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6385.701s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I just wanted to take an opportunity to say thank you as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=1936.454s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=1937.815s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=1939.496s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's very nice to have in writing someone's goals and where their focus is going to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=1944.94s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think it's very helpful for the community as a whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=1948.882s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They get to hear your voice and what you think the priorities are for your first year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=1953.666s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I just wanted to expand a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=1956.467s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You talk a lot about mathematics, and the reason for that is because when you joined us, you saw that that was the greatest need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=1963.555s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: for our district to focus on for this year, and I just wanted it to be out there that that's why that was chosen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=1969.197s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It wasn't arbitrary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=1970.698s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It was based on data in MCAS scores, and that was your assessment at the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=1976.881s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And as an instructional leader in your previous job, we felt that we would, you know, focus on that as a committee with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=1987.285s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And so just so the community knows, that's why mathematics is highlighted in your goals so directly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=1993.672s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And in future years, those goals will change as the district needs change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2000.316s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Again, thank you for your report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2004.018s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's really good to have this, especially when it comes time for us as a committee to do your review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2011.745s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: we can look back at what your goals were and how you've probably overshot most of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2018.069s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's my prediction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2020.41s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I do have a question about some of the happenings that you had in MedFit, but I'll wave to my colleagues if anybody else had a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2032.216s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Going back...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2147.186s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2148.927s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Just a couple questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2150.228s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know that the Medford High School Mall extended their hours until four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2156.607s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I remember before we had the retail shop through the vocational school, that as a PTO parent, I used to open the shop like one or two nights prior to the holidays.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2172.279s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And so parents could come after work, like 6 or 7 at night, and buy MAJS swag for their family members as Christmas gifts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2185.248s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't know if we have time or ability to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2189.451s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think even myself would love to get some new gear before it's kind of early in the day to get across many towns from work to there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2200.277s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I don't know if you could look it into, even if it's just one night, and have it staffed really well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2208.642s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know that I need a lot of stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2211.044s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Also, do they take credit card?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2213.813s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: or is it cash only, or how they pay for that would be helpful as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2220.294s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They take credit card now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2221.554s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2244.866s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And my second one is the Key Club.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2248.307s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know that you mentioned that they're doing a canned food drive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2251.227s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But years ago, they used to do caroling throughout the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2254.508s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I don't know if that's something that they still do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2258.129s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know you could make a donation or a cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2261.61s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't know if you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2262.91s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And they used to hire them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2264.27s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: If, say, you were having a holiday party in your house, they would come and carol at your house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2268.351s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I was just wondering if that was still something that they were doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2272.552s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It was a lot of fun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2273.913s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: when you had a big family gathering, and you'd have all of Method High's Key Club coming in and singing, and you'd give them hot chocolate and cookies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2296.297s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2296.817s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2298.197s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2298.877s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Is there a motion to accept the superintendent's oath... So motioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2809.482s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Congrats.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2810.623s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2812.285s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2812.805s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: First of all, I want to congratulate you and everybody that made it possible, the parents, the band members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2819.751s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You've really grown this program since the day you started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2823.674s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You hit the ground running and you've done a tremendous job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2827.197s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I wanted to congratulate you personally on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2833.115s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2835.637s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I also read through your packet, and I'm ready to approve this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2839.919s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: There's only one issue that I saw with it, and I spoke to you directly about it, is a few years ago, the school committee made it mandatory that all students take out the insurance when they're traveling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2850.645s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So if you make that change in this, I motion to approve it and volunteer to go if an extra<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2859.483s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: person is needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2861.164s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So remember, I was first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3399.175s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3399.795s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I only have a couple questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3403.556s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: At the Roberts fourth and fifth grade, there's a significant increase in the amount of students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3409.902s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I realize that part of that is because first year ELL students are sent to the Brooks and then they have the right to come back to the Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3423.728s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3424.348s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Is that how it's working, Diane?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3447.407s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So those numbers won't be as high for fourth grade next year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3451.709s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3451.829s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Just fifth grade will continue to be high and they'll move out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3454.411s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes, they'll be followed in the middle schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3455.691s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3455.972s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I was just curious if that was the case or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3458.433s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That was my first question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3460.114s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And then my other question is, thank you for breaking it down by subgroups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3463.676s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's really good for us to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3468.091s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You know, it's a snapshot of the district and what we're looking at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3471.993s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: There's just one thing I was hoping that we could also know is like how many homeless families and students we have in the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3480.598s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't know if you have that count.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3483.439s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's just, especially this time of year, I'm very aware of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3486.981s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I take care of the homeless families for another district, so I'm well aware that a lot more people recently in the district I work at<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3497.246s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: have become homeless, and I was just wondering where we are in Medford and how many families and where they're sheltering them, if we know that information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3506.994s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And it doesn't have to be tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3508.936s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I was just curious just to have a snapshot of our district and the needs of the people in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3518.003s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So if we could get that at a later date, that would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3533.351s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3667.56s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mayor Burke, just as a follow-up, both my children were members of those classrooms many years ago, because they're 27 and 25 now, and both learned an exceptional amount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3680.863s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They still remember<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3683.215s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: a lot of the things that they did on a daily basis in that program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3687.024s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And it really enhanced, they were the model students, they were the typical developing students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3693.302s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: that they called them all the students back then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3707.065s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And it's a tremendous program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3708.765s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So anybody listening that has a child, it's a great opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3717.747s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The tuition is not expensive, or it wasn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3723.107s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's a really, really wonderful way for your child to develop and grow within the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3732.835s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And it helps them prepare for school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3735.437s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: A lot of fun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3737.219s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: A lot, a lot of fun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3739.981s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think that some of those teachers are still there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3979.483s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3981.264s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you for the report, and thank you for adding the revolving amounts, because I probably would have asked for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3989.31s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I had a question to start off with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3992.512s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Is the beginning balances for all of those programs, the ME program and the after school, before school, they all started with the negative balance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4038.335s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: In future, could you give us the balance on that amount, like the total on that column?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4051.157s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4051.938s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4054.298s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Oh, OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4056.618s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's just so we can just see it nice and easy, and it's right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4064.08s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4065.475s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4067.056s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And then we can just look at big picture and then it's a little easier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4072.56s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So the only question I had is, another question I had actually is page three of nine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4079.626s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And then it was like, under elementary schools, the last four items, did those schools not use all of their<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4093.021s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: textbooks allocated fee allocated amounts or that's correct so whatever was expensed is what was utilized and any balances were what was remaining from the allocation provided I just wanted I just saw two things last year is that towards the end of the school year some principals when they came forward hadn't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4118.798s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: and purchase requests for things soon enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4121.939s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I just want to make sure that we work with them this year to make sure that they're aware to start pre-ordering in time before the accounting department needs to close out their books.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4165.588s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, and my last thing is the athletics department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4168.869s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I understand the need, and by no means do we want to change anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4172.67s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We have great programming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4175.935s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: a wide range, a variety of things that all our students have taken advantage of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4182.999s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But I thought when we did the budget, we raised their pre-budgeted amount so that way it would reflect on what the need was so we weren't going to be at the end of the year doing this again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4239.754s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Can't win for winning, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4242.056s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Oh, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4243.337s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4244.317s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just want to keep moving forward for that because it makes it look like we're not funding it well and I would rather be proactive than reactive with that because I don't want to cut anything and I don't want people to think, oh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4259.068s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: you know, it's over budget all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4260.95s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We need to budget it well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4263.673s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4264.154s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I appreciate the answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4896.786s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Isn't that the committee that you were on that they had to file?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4902.908s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4903.548s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So we will have, be able to see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4907.169s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4907.749s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Once that goes, it was supposed to go into effect in October.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5321.783s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto, a question on this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5323.484s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5325.405s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So there was a subcommittee on this last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5331.227s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: My colleagues were on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5333.048s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And we had a presentation by Jenny Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5335.569s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: She presented this online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5338.792s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: program that all our PTOs and friends of groups were supposed to start utilizing by October 1st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5349.477s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And with the transition of the new superintendent and the administrative team, that deadline hasn't happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5355.997s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So we already have the form and it's been approved by this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5359.298s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I would like to move forward with the date for all our current PTOs and friends of account to start using those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5368.819s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I would like to see everybody registered by February 1st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5373.06s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think that's a significant amount of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5375.041s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know with the holidays, it gives them the whole month of January after that to look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5380.702s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And they'll be looking at doing their<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5383.337s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Taxes for the 5013 C. So they'll have the documents right in front of them So I'm making a motion at this point to continue what we voted on for October 1st with to continue that and have all of our groups beyond on that line in facilitated by Emily by by February 1st of 2019 and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5482.667s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Actually, it was a little bit more than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5485.89s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They had certain requirements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5488.111s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Maybe we should provide, maybe we could ask Jenny Graham to come and present the form to us to refresh us of what's on there, so that way we all see it again, because it was almost a year ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5498.819s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Or at least to the subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5500.841s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Do you have it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5504.107s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Right, and we did make it mandatory at our meeting last year that all groups affiliated with using friends of or PTOs, anything reflecting it was mandatory, it wasn't voluntary for those groups to submit their information, otherwise they weren't allowed to raise funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5528.242s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: using four Method High groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5530.786s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So it's not a voluntary thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5532.508s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just wanted to be very clear that any group raising funds for students<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5536.929s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: student activities that, through MEDFED, have mandated to register.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5543.695s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just wanted to be very clear on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5643.116s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2878.652s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2879.652s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So can we get Mr. Russo's very important questions in a follow-up report in the next few weeks after these trainings have come?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2888.455s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Like how many people have come, all those specific questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2893.977s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And we can email you them if you need them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2896.918s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That would be helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2897.598s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2898.958s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that way we don't expect people to come with the answers prior to the training.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2905.2s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But after the training, it's really nice to have you come back and say how it went, how much participation, and if you feel like what went really well and what changes you would make for next time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2916.85s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And they were very good points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2919.432s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: My question was, I just want to make sure we're incorporating the Curtis Tufts program that we have here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2926.658s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We have an alternative high school program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2928.6s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I would really like to see their presence at all of these trainings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2932.163s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: These are experts that deal with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2934.684s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: children's needs all day, as well as our director of student services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2939.667s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They are experts within our district, and I think that they could bring a lot of value by their presence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2945.831s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And them going and hearing what this, whoever, all people, all parties attending, their concerns are, they also grow as educators and figure out what the needs are for the district and how to make<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2962.29s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: our programs meet those needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2964.931s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And it will help for pre-planning and being proactive rather than reactive about the needs within our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2972.294s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I strongly recommend that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2976.055s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I motion to accept the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5071.401s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5072.682s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5073.182s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5075.404s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just had a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5077.245s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know in the past, you used to do two different nights, one for vocational and one<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5082.393s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: the high school side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5083.214s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I know since the merger that we try to combine it because it is one school with two programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5090.519s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I just want to make sure students that not necessarily think the high school might be for them might get that opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5101.608s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And the opposite as well, students that might not have thought of the vocational programming or looking at it<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5109.905s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: have that opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5110.746s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I do like the idea of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5113.828s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's just a lot to cover in one evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5115.909s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I just was wondering how, you know, if you're going to have another night and maybe in the spring, just because people weren't able to get around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5422.354s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5424.675s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'll follow up to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5426.216s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know that they had summer program, like a preview of different programs that the high school vocational programming offers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5435.119s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Is that going to be in the works for next summer as well?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5437.32s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5437.52s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And can we advertise that very early?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6647.465s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6648.916s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I really think that my colleague is trying to do is have like a brainstorming, meet the school committee, bring your talent and your ideas for us, like maybe a goal setting meeting with the school committee present, like to hear what the community thinks are priorities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6671.352s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: thinks ways that they can join the school committee in different ways, the school department in different ways and be helpful, active participants in the school community as a whole as opposed to having a more formal meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6688.547s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: If I'm hearing you correctly from what I'm hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6693.172s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I think he's looking for an opportunity to have a way for people to access, to have access to us as a committee and to just like volunteer and give us ideas and priorities and like dialogue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6708.799s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: More so than like an official meeting with administrators and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6714.89s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That, is that what, am I hearing correctly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6717.391s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Is that more what you're looking for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6718.972s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I need some clarity on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6734.28s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Community participation throughout the district in ways that parents and, you know, community participation and involvement<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6745.647s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: both with the school department and the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6748.33s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's just to open it up, to hear the voices of the people in our community and to meet them and to see what they have to offer and what they'd like to do and what they see our future as.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6760.442s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: At least that's what I'm hearing and I could be off base.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6764.466s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't know if my colleague wants to clarify a little bit more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=7160.129s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Oh, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=7160.829s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Before we move to executive session, could we just go over the requested reports?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=7165.974s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think we've received some of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=7167.475s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And just make sure that the list is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=7177.523s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: If we could get an update of where we are on that in the next few weeks or early January, that would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=7213.44s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Will we receive one big report with every school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=7223.424s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And is there a time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=7224.805s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Do you have an idea of when that would be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=7227.486s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's a part of the executive session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=7231.227s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Gotcha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=7235.902s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We had an update on that and we'll be having a follow-up meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=7239.366s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just want to speak with the superintendent about scheduling that and my associates, of course, as well as the special education and the special education pack.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=7269.982s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=578.405s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's probably very easily explained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=580.487s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: On page 7 of 8, it says three quarters of the way down, I'd say, right above the vocational automotive supplies is SPED pro-development expenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=597.401s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Did they come in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=598.222s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Did we send people out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=599.283s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I was just curious what we were doing for professional development for the special education department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=618.936s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I had one more question since you're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=621.437s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It was on page 5 of 8 and the bottom of 4 of 8.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=633.614s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Riddell All-American Athletic Officials, the total looks like about $9,000, and I was just wondering, I know it looks like a company, but it just seems like a lot of money for athletic officials, and it might be like five different sports or, I don't know, I just saw a lot of athletic officials individually paid, which I know we hire<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=658.621s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: individual people, but when I saw this large amount, $3,027.40, and then $5,596.39, and a $416.37 together, it's about $9,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=664.346s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I was just wondering,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=675.91s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: if you knew a little bit more about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=677.611s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It seemed like a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=754.447s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mustone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=755.388s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=755.508s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Otero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=756.348s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=756.568s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=756.749s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: DeWolfson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=759.511s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=1744.21s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Of course, we would love to receive that corporate sponsor, but if not, I would like to make a motion on the floor to cover the expenses since she'll be representing MEDFED in a way that is so important for our community that there's a motion on the floor to cover the cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=1761.167s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It wouldn't be the first time that this committee has allocated funds in this way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=1767.074s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'd like to make the motion that if corporate sponsorship does not come through, that we pay the full cost for her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=2712.696s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=2714.62s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Oh, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=2715.32s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=2716.42s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=2717.641s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just had a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=2719.421s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: In the book, I didn't see the Roberts School representative when it represented it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=2741.386s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You know me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=2741.806s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't miss a thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=2753.796s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's excellent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=2755.738s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I also want to say how appreciative I am that empathy and the whole child learning is really coming out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=2767.631s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: in these projects, and I think that the joy that they'll get from serving their community will also reflect in everything else they do in life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=2777.724s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You're inspiring people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=2779.686s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's great work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=2780.047s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=2780.548s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I really appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=3430.506s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Did anyone else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=3431.186s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=3431.767s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Domenico?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=3432.827s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just had a quick question on students with IEPs and 504 plans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=3438.769s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Is their presentation the same time as the college night?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=3442.43s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because some students could go to that presentation and still need to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=3462.742s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=3463.302s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I was just making sure that when it's planned it's not at the same exact time so that students had an opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=141.104s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=142.444s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mrs. Fenton, present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=144.125s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=340.061s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you, Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=346.204s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just wanted to comment, while we were at that meeting, we saw a large growth in our ELA due to the journeys program that we purchased four years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=354.867s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And it takes about three or four years when we purchase a program to see the growth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=359.789s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that was really outstanding to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=362.23s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We still have a long way to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=365.365s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But we're all working together as a team to make strides and make the best education possible for all children in Method Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=373.749s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's why we invest so much money into new programming and piloting programming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=380.932s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And as a committee, we talked a lot about the science program, the class program that is being piloted this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=387.175s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And we talked about it at our last meeting and how that is going to be tremendous for our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=392.58s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But again, that growth won't be seen immediately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=395.423s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It might take a few years before we actually see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=398.746s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I personally have been waiting to see that growth in ELA, and I'm so grateful that we have that showing that it's actually working for our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=409.215s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I look forward to seeing what Lesley's partnership will do as far as MCAF schools and how they're going to help us move forward as a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=419.765s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: as a school district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=420.805s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=421.426s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=753.422s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So Erin gave the motion to... I gave the motion today to move forward with the CBC funding, as well as to give Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=764.13s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Patterson the authority to put out<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=768.848s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: the two other quotes for this and to move forward once those are obtained and to start the project as soon as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=778.675s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And that was approved there unanimously, and I hope that my colleague... And I second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=784.279s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So moved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=883.435s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: My vote is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=888.097s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1604.712s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Just a point of information, open houses at the high school and the vocational school<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1611.175s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You can't go in and sell them there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2636.343s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mrs. Rappori, part of it is I want to thank you for always giving our students this opportunity to see the world, especially with service projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2646.311s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because I think when our children get to go and see an area, they come home a little more thankful for what they have, appreciative of their family and their education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2659.141s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I think it changes who they are from that point forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2662.737s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I think it's something that these 39 children will carry forward, as well as all the children you have brought before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2670.22s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So as a committee member, I thank you for taking our students and all the other staff members that give up their time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2677.744s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And one of these days, I am going to come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3489.156s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you, Mrs. Mistone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3493.497s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: There was no mention of the Columbus School in the presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3496.958s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Are we going to try to get them on board as well?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=306.761s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Always help with something, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=309.342s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=309.903s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Patterson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=311.483s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: On page 2 of 10,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=317.128s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It says about a quarter of the way down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=319.43s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Game time, $3,771.26 for operation and maintenance of contracted building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=329.618s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just didn't know what game time was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=335.662s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=336.203s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Makes sense then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=337.123s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I was wondering what games we were doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=339.605s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Is it installed and all set?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=341.587s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=342.507s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=343.108s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Kids are sliding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=343.788s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's awesome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=344.909s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you for your work on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=413.739s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=415.401s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Could Mr. McLaughlin let us know when that's completed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=421.405s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=423.847s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Just a quick one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=477.489s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=478.83s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know last year, and I forget the dates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=481.011s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm just asking for someone to remind me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=483.412s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know that we do a complete audit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=486.673s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And when would we get that audit, as well as how often we're going to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=492.067s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: see the actual payrolls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=493.607s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know it was biannually, but I didn't remember if it was like November or if it was January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=533.044s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I thought we had agreed, like, biannually we would get a complete payroll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=537.406s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And just so we know, because we're voting on payroll twice a year, I think that's what we voted on during last year, last spring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=546.488s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's my understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=547.689s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: In January, it's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=549.122s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: if that works in your schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=550.603s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, certainly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=554.004s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, and then... Right, because we still have... I think that's what we decided on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=556.645s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just wanted to make sure I had the dates correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=559.987s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I couldn't remember if it was November or January that we had stated, but I know we had voted, because I think we were talking quarterly, and then we thought that was too cumbersome for your department, so we moved it to biannually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=571.572s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So, we'll remember and go with January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=575.277s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And again, you know, the end of May, early June, because the end of the year is so crazy, if that works for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5398.337s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Hi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5399.098s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you, Megan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5400.338s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Megan and I have been neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5403.139s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: When she lived in Medford, she was on my street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5405.5s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And her daughter actually went to the Columbus School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5411.562s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5412.202s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And so I was thrilled to have Megan receive this position, because as soon as I heard it, I knew that we were in for really quality instruction to our staff, who could then give it to our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5427.712s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: and I'm very excited as you grow in the position and you are able to fully staff your positions that we can grow the program and then we can talk about meeting all different subgroups and needs of all of our students and we can grow it in that manner as well to make sure that we're doing that and I've spoken to the superintendent about future that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5453.607s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Right now, staffing is the priority<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5456.587s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Another thing is priority is customer service to our parents and our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5464.273s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I did speak with someone from the Columbus School who said that they're not on the wait list because when they approached about after school, it was like, oh, there's no way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5473.981s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The list is already so long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5476.503s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Sent that parent an email saying, here's some other resources in town, good luck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5481.547s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And they weren't added to the list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5482.988s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I've spoke to you directly about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5484.649s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I know you're making effective change in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5487.431s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But that parent, as of right now, as of today, when I checked with them, said that they were still not on the wait list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5493.475s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't know if someone added them since then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5495.856s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But there may be other parents out there that aren't on the wait list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5499.899s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I don't know how to go back and address that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5502.6s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But we just need to make sure that every family with need<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5512.303s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: given the chance for us to meet that need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5516.365s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I mean, it's so important because we have working parents and single families and parents with family members with medical needs or all of the above that really look to us to help them to be able to afford to work in order to take care of their children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5538.783s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So this is really, really out, and I call it out of school time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5542.624s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know that we don't call it that as a community, but I'd like to, at some point, sit down with the committee and talk about out of school time and how we care for students and how we manage them during school breaks and during summers and to include everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5558.629s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I look at it as the biggest thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5560.449s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I know that you're gonna look into that at all schools, not just the Columbus, and to make sure that the wait list is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5568.418s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: accurate and really fill the gaps where the biggest needs are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5573.561s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Just because there are more students at one school doesn't mean that the students at the less populated schools don't have greater needs as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5586.267s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So those are a few of my concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5588.708s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know that you're staffing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5590.029s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know that you're working really hard to recruit people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5595.368s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: When the Boys and Girls Club in Somerville closed, I was hoping that we could get some of those staff members and bring them over to ours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5602.155s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That was such a great find.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5611.103s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So if anybody in the community hears, we are hiring Medford 2 to 6 for our after school program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5618.311s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I also think that there are some opportunities that we could put forward, like providing free CPR and maybe free fingerprinting, just to fill the roles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5627.973s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know that as a district, we don't usually do that, but the people in these positions are such part-time, that might encourage people if we're waiving those upfront costs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5638.675s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'd like to make a motion or to ask the superintendent if we could look into doing that at this time, to waive CPR in first aid,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5648.359s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I mean, in fingerprinting costs, so that way we can entice more people to join the staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5653.242s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because at the low rate of pay, it's probably a week or two of someone's salary that they're working.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5681.754s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'm going to make a motion at this point as to providing CPR at no cost and finger-pringing costs be provided for these before and after school programming people so we can make sure our staffing needs and our children's care is met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6758.878s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6759.658s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That was partially my question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6761.259s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes, you did, with the new superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6766.059s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But I have to say the superintendent<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6769.838s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: presented to us recently her overview and what her plan is going to be and I was extremely impressed with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6781.54s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'm glad that this is offered to new superintendents because without it they would be calling old superintendents and trying to piece work things and I think this is a really step-by-step process for them and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6799.136s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: making the focus back on to the children in the curriculum in MCAF schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6805.141s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And that's pretty much what we're here to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6808.744s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I know that I've given her some phone calls myself that probably have distracted her from that focus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6816.15s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And so these reminders are good for me as a school committee member as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6821.435s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I look forward to see what her goals are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6823.736s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm sure they'll be substantial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6828.411s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just want them to be realistic and attainable and hope that it's a successful beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6836.833s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm very excited for what our community has in store with Dr. Edward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6876.138s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: As school committee members ourselves, I work in education, so there are some superintendents that I do call and ask<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6884.767s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: you know, policy procedures and how different areas and what they expect from their school committee members when they're coming forward to make sure that I'm in line, as well as with other school committee members who have no problem telling me when I'm in or out of line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6905.982s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But it's helpful to us as well to have that feedback and to have that collaboration and to see it<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6913.949s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: in this format is really, really helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6918.83s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't know who came up with the idea, but it's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6922.531s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Rather than floundering on their own and not making effective change the minute they come in, or not assessing things, and knowing where the strengths and the weaknesses of the current district are is extremely beneficial, not only to the superintendent, but all the way down to every student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6940.818s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So it's worth every penny from what I've seen so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6945.261s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I look forward to what's presented to us over the next year or three, depending on how long we're all here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6958.208s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6958.528s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6960.709s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7703.128s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7703.828s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7704.588s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: My question, you kind of led into it, how does this program differentiate for students with special needs and our EL population?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7713.57s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And are any of these teachers that are attending or doing these trainings<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7721.045s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: piloting the program EL or special education teachers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7847.35s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And the timeline for purchasing would be, at one point during this year, would we have to make the decision to pull the trigger and get all the supplies in for the beginning of next year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7895.478s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So we'll raise the September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7897.319s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You know, like, if we could do training May or June, so that way when our teachers come back in September, we're not trying to teach them at the beginning of the school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7907.645s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They're already come in prepared and ready to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7909.486s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We want to make sure we're going to go forward with it, though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8467.393s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8468.914s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8469.975s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8471.095s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mayor Burke, can we make a motion to give the superintendent leeway to enter into negotiations with this company to purchase this and start training<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8482.87s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: teachers in April so that they're ready to begin with the materials for September 1.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8500.204s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Even if we don't do any kits, we can make a contract and have the training start so our teachers, even without the manipulatives,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8508.783s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Like any training that they would come in and do in September, if we bought it in July 1st or early through the summer, if we could get that done before the teachers leave, then we're all setting up and running and we're not doing that training piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8522.566s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that's what we need to negotiate with the purchase of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8526.087s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We need to push hard if they want to sell us the $250,000 program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8532.828s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Like we want our training done by June 15th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8536.323s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: so that way we're not doing it over the summer or in September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8739.883s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8740.683s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Bernadetto?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8741.984s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Do we know how many homeschooled students we have in the district and how we check on those students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8795.516s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8796.416s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8902.386s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8903.287s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Excuse me, Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8905.197s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8905.977s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8906.437s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Also, point of clarification, a student can move to another school district without withdrawing from a district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8913.459s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And until they're gone 10 days, you can't withdraw them so that September 6 was probably prior to us being open for 10 days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8922.121s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So there were students listed as absent that actually are going elsewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8927.023s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And that's how we look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8929.563s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that's why there's an October 1 deadline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8932.427s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: the reporting students to DESC, it gives you that first at least month for the district to work out its enrollment numbers before you report them, and then you're financially responsible for those ones from that point on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9376.29s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9377.17s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9378.611s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: On our reports, it's usually under number 11.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9382.792s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It says requested reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9386.072s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: There's a few items I'd like added to that list for our next meeting, just so we all don't forget a few items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9392.834s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think they got lost on the back sheet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9394.394s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9396.195s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9396.835s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So my list would be PTO Friends of Registration Form updates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9405.372s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: when that's going to be posted and who in the district's going to be responsible for upkeep of that information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9416.076s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The security report, an update on Lena DiGentimaso's plaque and ribbon-cutting disabilities awareness program that we talked about previously, just like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9435.376s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: maybe the subcommittee needs to meet first on this with the special education programming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9442.178s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We were gonna check with Leslie to see if they had any programming that they could offer us as far as disability awareness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9449.94s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We talked about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9452.761s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Just an update from the superintendent, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9457.922s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: If Leslie offers the disability awareness program, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9463.565s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's late at night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9465.726s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So also an update from the payroll in January, just to keep it on the report, that it's requested January payroll update and an audit update as those items are completed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9482.892s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And the homeschool numbers that Bernadette Riccadeli offered to provide us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9493.643s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, the audit ends the January just as reminders like a like a tickler file so we don't forget in January they're supposed to report this these two reports so that way we as a committee don't lose track because we do so many things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9514.85s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And they usually write the date it was requested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9517.371s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And then we can see how long it's been on the list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9519.992s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And every once in a while, we look at it and say, hey, we should maybe loop back to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=392.418s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Definitely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=394.518s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=394.959s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Hey Burke, there was a few community members at our meeting and I want to thank them for coming forward this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=401.521s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We have Councilor Marks here and I just wanted to give him a chance<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=405.412s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: to say a few words, if he so chose, so the community could hear all the wonderful things that Lena DiGentimaso did in her 28 years of service to our community and our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=417.419s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: He knew her best, one of the best in the community, and would you like to say a few words, if it's okay with?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=423.823s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Certainly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=808.496s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=809.696s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mayor Burke, I motion to approve these items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=813.258s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think the new Bistro will get more business if we are careful, but approve these licenses to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=822.903s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm sure that any<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=828.339s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Any security would be present at the times of these programs being run.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=836.242s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I look forward to more and more business coming to our bistro, because it's beautiful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=842.364s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And we invested a lot in that part of our vocational education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=845.846s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And it gives our students the best opportunity to learn and grow in their trade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=852.214s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I make a motion at this time to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=923.278s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The first item is, I saw Jenny Graham here and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=927.605s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The PTOs had a registration form that we created last year, and it's an online form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=933.186s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And we need to provide training to the PTOs and other organizations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=938.367s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I know it was an online form, and I'm not sure that the superintendent is aware of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=943.388s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And all of those organizations are supposed to register by, I can't remember if it was October 1st or mid-October.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=950.729s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And since that is very soon,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=954.035s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I didn't know if Jenny could come up and just refresh our mind about what she presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=958.579s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I remember being very impressed with the online form and how we were going about it, and exactly which groups are responsible for filling them out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=969.327s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I didn't remember everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1222.961s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1224.381s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Also, as a follow-up, I think it was pretty sure that we mandated all that used the method public schools as part of their fundraising in any way had to do the training and had to register their group in order to use our buildings, to allocate, to raise money, in any way, shape, or form,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1248.051s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I totally forgot that and it just came flooding back to me when Ginny was sitting in the audience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1254.454s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that's why I brought it up, but I didn't want it to lose it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2167.897s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2168.117s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: DiBenedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2168.998s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2169.678s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2170.658s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: First of all, I'd really like to thank a few people for their help throughout this project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2176.702s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2176.902s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Patterson, Assistant Superintendent, thank you for the time and effort for both you and your department that you've taken to help us get this to this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2187.33s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I also want to thank the superintendent for taking the time and making this a priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2193.073s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Of course, the CPC, which allocated the funding for the project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2197.496s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I especially, we've learned a lot through the process how to apply for the CPC money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2203.66s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I know Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2205.541s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Patterson has plans to continue working through them for different projects throughout our school district and asking them so they'll, we'll get better at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2216.323s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: and they'll get to know what we need and what we want and what's coming forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2221.126s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We learned a lot through the process and I'm grateful all the community members that came up and spoke at our last meeting and helped us learn different things and how to approach different things because we all can learn and move forward in different ways together as a team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2235.616s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Especially at this time, I want to thank Cheryl Rodriguez directly for taking the initiative to apply for this money<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2244.779s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: and to not give up and to see it all the way to the end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2249.301s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Her dedication to this work and her school in general and the years that she's been serving on that PTO and as a parent at that school has really been inspiring to me as a committee member and to many families throughout our district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2266.927s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I just wanted to really give that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2270.249s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Again, thank you, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2271.289s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Patterson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2272.85s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know there's still a lot more work<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2274.824s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I'll probably say it again at the end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2276.666s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I just have one final question for tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2281.03s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: What color did they pick?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2283.053s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because Mr. Johnson is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2285.996s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Can we do a Mustang blue?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2288.879s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mustang blue all the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2290.32s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Good choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2292.923s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2293.603s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3119.912s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's what I was going to ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3121.213s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: These people are continually in front of us making donations to the students in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3126.878s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I would like to send a thank you note as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3130.18s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3298.703s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3300.523s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Could you give us an idea of the cost involved for a breakfast or a lunch?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3304.904s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Just so the community knows what to bring in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3307.025s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Is it cash only?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3332.243s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And will all of that be on the website so people can check it out ahead of time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3349.995s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Oh, that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3350.676s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: While all the teachers, they can grab their breakfast and go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3379.846s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Has that been advertised at all to the community or to the parents?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3801.254s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3802.114s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3802.875s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm very happy to see the professional development opportunities for our teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3810.54s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So when I met with the special education PAC leader over the summer, they're hoping to have a disability awareness program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3820.727s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I didn't know if there was a possibility that Leslie may already have something that we could use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3828.226s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: for our teaching staff or our community as a whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3831.427s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And rather than create it from a lot of outside places, we can see, since we already have this partnership, if they already have something developed that we could share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3841.41s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm hoping to reach out to the other members of this subcommittee soon and see if we can make a meeting at that time, a meeting sometime soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3852.233s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I'm wondering if a liaison from Leslie, if they have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3858.093s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: anything could possibly attend?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3880.304s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We're still at the beginning basis and gathering information of what that program will look like and where we get it from to bring it in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3887.74s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So if Leslie already has some type of programming available and that we can utilize that without costing the district with this partnership, it would save us some money and time from looking and we can move forward on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3903.748s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'll talk to you directly more about it, but I think that these types of partnerships are gonna become very helpful for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3914.653s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=4538.143s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: As chairsperson of the curriculum subcommittee, I'd like to move this item to subcommittee and have that meeting soon after the release of the MCAS so we can go over those district reports prior to them being discussed at our school committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=4557.868s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know that MCAS are released in December for last year, I mean October.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=4563.952s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So last year, so once those items are released, maybe we can incorporate all assessments and how we're looking at where children are and where, what our next steps are and go over that at a subcommittee meeting and have a bigger conversation since this seems like it's an important piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=4581.703s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I motion to speak about this and that at a subcommittee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=4587.206s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Member Ruseau is also a member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=4589.718s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And member Rogerio is also a member of that committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=4593.739s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'd like to move this item to subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=4880.414s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Also, the other report that we received recently had some recommendations for the school district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=4885.358s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So maybe they could be added to that committee meeting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=4888.543s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: with Safe Haven's report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=4896.73s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Right, I saw a few things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=4899.212s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So maybe they could be added to that agenda of that subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8.694s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you for supplying us a new copy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=11.657s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That was one of my questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=13.038s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But on page 7 of 40, about a little bit less than halfway down, there is a payment of $1,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=20.243s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It says pending classification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=25.086s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I was just wondering what that item was for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=28.689s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's a miscellaneous gifts and refund account for the scholarship limb prize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=35.377s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, and there was another one that also had another $1,000, so that was later in, so it's probably another scholarship, and that was on page 20 of 40, and the second one from the bottom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=61.813s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And what was the amount of that, please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=63.614s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Again, $1,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=66.012s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's the very bottom of the page, the second one up, it says pending classification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=70.114s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes, that is the same account, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=72.075s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=73.356s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So my next question was, sorry, on, oh, that was the duplicate payment to someplace, so you already rectified that by giving us a new thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=87.923s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Another question I had was on page 25 of 40.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=92.345s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: and it's dated July 23rd, and it's for $625.30.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=97.189s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's the fifth one up from the bottom, and it says school committee superintendents choose Beverly Nelson, but Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=106.597s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Nelson retired prior to that date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=118.935s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Are we paying for the dues for the year for Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=121.438s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Nelson as well as Mr. Nelson?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=130.786s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, thank you for clearing that up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=133.228s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I believe that was my last question, and thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=1367.719s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto, I heard that Dr. Maurice might have ridden the school bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=1373.761s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: She did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=1374.441s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I heard that too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=1376.902s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Word got around town very quickly that you were on the school bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=1415.21s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Oh, I'm sure they were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=1416.17s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just wanted to know if you started a sing-along while you were on the bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=1427.127s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It impressed our community to a point where I was getting phone calls that you were on the bus and that's a great way to start the school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=1434.857s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I have high hopes for all our remaining days to go as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=1440.745s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2003.682s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: First of all, John, thank you for all the work and your whole department for keeping the schools as nice as they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2010.444s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know it's a big job with the short budget and you do great work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2029.363s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So with regards to that, I'm still hoping that all schools can get their windows washed at some point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2035.144s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's a goal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2036.124s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And maybe we can maybe get some bids this year so we can arrange for that to happen in the spring, because I think it will make a big difference in every building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2046.006s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know it's probably going to be a big cost, or we're going to have to do it in-house with the right equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2050.827s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know it's not an easy job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2069.449s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2071.93s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: My next question was about the high school pool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2074.551s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know there were some issues with that, and maybe you could update us as to where we are with that right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2080.874s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Is that open?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2113.734s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I was like, oh, this is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2115.616s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So could, not directed to you, but could we get an update on the costs involved, and what was done, and how long it does, and any maintenance issues that we're gonna make sure that we're okay for that for future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2128.886s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know the pool was just done six years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2130.788s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just wanna make sure we maintain that, because we did put a couple million dollars into that project, and we wanna make sure<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2137.374s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: we're maintaining the things that we're investing in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2142.956s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: For six years to have no issues is a really good thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2145.556s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And it gets used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2159.18s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you for addressing some of our early childhood students' air conditioning needs, because that was requested<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2165.569s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: like two or three years ago, you and I had, well, you had done some good work over there, and I'm glad to see that continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2172.777s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: As well as the Curtis Tufts School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2176.121s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I can't wait till every floor is that beautiful golden oak and not that darker color.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2182.808s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know you haven't forgotten about that building, and I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2198.229s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just wanted to acknowledge those things and just make sure that the beautification that happened outside the schools with the mulch and the flowers, that really makes people happy walking into the building, not just the people who work there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2211.735s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The people who work there, the children that attend there, their families, and it's the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2216.15s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: first and last thing people see when they're walking through our doors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2219.292s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'd like to continue with that being a priority with our staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2224.875s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I do have another question about how the money for the turf field came about, because it just wasn't clear to me as a member how that happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2237.521s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I don't know if that's a question for the mayor or the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2244.208s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm not familiar with the linkage account and what that does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3113.028s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3113.869s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'd actually like to give the floor to Cheryl before I speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3120.65s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I attended a lot of the CPA, CPC meetings with her to support her through this whole thing, but since she's the originator, I yield to her and to what she wants to present and why the amount was $109,000 to begin with and how we've<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3138.075s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: you know, just open the conversation up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3143.397s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Before I do that, I'd just like to acknowledge that we have a city councillor in the room, Brianna Mwango-Cohen, and she's also here, and she's also been a strong supporter of this program and many other school programs, so I just wanna acknowledge that she is in the audience, and maybe she can, at some point, if we do need to expedite things, help us in that manner if she sees fit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4039.696s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4040.957s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: At the beginning, the CPA was very careful about what they were awarding and exactly how much money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4047.12s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And the quotes, the amount of money presented to the CPA was based on a quote that Cheryl had from the same company to do it, because they wanted us to keep the price down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4062.187s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They didn't want to spend $200,000 for this project or allocate that money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4067.957s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So my point is that I don't know going back to them, asking them for more money on this project is going to work from what I've seen and what I, I stood there with Cheryl and answered their questions and they were very cautious about how much money they were giving us towards this ground coverage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4086.077s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And this was told to us that it was a one time thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4088.9s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They weren't going to do all the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4090.605s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And they wanted the square products.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4092.587s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They were specific about what products we had to use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4095.129s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They were specific about how much they were going to allocate to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4099.113s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So even my concern is going through this whole process through October might not get us the extra money from them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4106.621s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And then where are we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4109.666s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Initially, I believe, John gave some of the names of contractors to get quotes to Cheryl, and that's the companies that she's presenting those figures to you now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4123.114s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So it wasn't like she went out and got them aimlessly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4126.095s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The school— No, no, I'm just filling in that blank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4129.637s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's not like she went off to a company that we have no known knowledge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5305.078s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5305.818s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5309.12s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5310.34s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So initially when this was presented to the CPA and we were allocated these funds, this was what we had because that's what we needed to have and that was the scope of work we were looking to get done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5325.507s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I don't know how it, if it changed and it got more elaborate,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5330.192s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: when it went to the bidding process, but this was our pilot program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5334.88s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: This was to see if this stuff worked in our schools before we did the big McGlynn-Andrews<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5343.515s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: because it's huge, in other schools in the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5346.538s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: This was piloting it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5347.979s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We were getting this money not from the school department, but from every taxpayer in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5353.864s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We want to make sure that this is the right product to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5357.426s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We want to make sure that these children have a chance to run and play in a safe area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5362.851s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I believe the intent<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5364.972s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: of this project is awesome and great and we should move forward with what we initially applied for and received.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5373.016s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And if we can do it with the CPA funds and move quickly, I think we should.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5378.019s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I make a motion to move forward with this project as it was initially brought forward not only to this committee, to the school department, but to the CPA and just move forward for the best interest of the children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5409.655s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So we can do it pending their approval?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6193.457s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6194.338s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: To speak of the air conditioning issue, I had spoken to Dr. Edouard-Vincent earlier in the week about the possibility of moving the school, the out of school time camp, the summer fun camp back to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6209.589s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The Columbus School and the children used to walk to the pool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6212.551s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I was giving her some history of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6214.532s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So there is still a pool accessible, and it did work there for a few years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6220.215s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And based on the heat, and if we can't fix the issue by next summer, I think that, you know, that is a strong possibility for that location again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6230.361s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But since Melanie came forward and spoke a little bit about the special education path,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6237.833s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I wanted to request information from the committee on who is on the subcommittee for the special education subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6247.036s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know I'm the chairperson, and I know we announced it at the end of last year, and I didn't catch the names of the other members, because I would like to call for a meeting within the next two weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6260.361s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Oh, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6261.901s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That would be terrific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6263.502s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I did have an opportunity just to follow up to meet<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6267.752s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: with Melanie a few weeks ago and just prioritize a few issues to be discussed at that committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6275.615s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So we would like to move forward with that quickly, Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6279.156s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So your help with that would be very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6281.577s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6283.658s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Secondly, I'd like to know where those air conditioners maybe went.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6291.501s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And so that way, if we do need them in the next week or two, because we are still<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6295.968s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know the heat wave's supposed to break tomorrow, but it could come back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6299.47s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So, I mean, there's probably areas that really could use them if we could look around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6304.053s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Or do we wanna consider that AC fundraiser?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6309.917s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know it's a draw on electrical and it caused other issues, but we need to look outside the box sometimes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6316.402s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And people coming forward with ideas and outside the box is beneficial to this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6321.885s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I don't wanna just like, okay, we couldn't find them and move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6325.881s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Let's figure it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6328.061s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Also, not only is the summer fun program an issue, I would like to see unification of our out of school time programming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6337.483s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So it would be the morning before school programming, the after school programming, the week long camp programming, and the summer programming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6346.625s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'd like to look at that as one big program and make sure that we have great staff and great curriculum and great things for children to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6355.73s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But I also want to make sure that it's deliberate and it's inclusional to students that are EL students as well as special education students or any other students with needs, financial or whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6368.613s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I would like to, I don't know which committee that should go under, but I really would like to work on that through this year and really build an excellent programming because our job as<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6380.272s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: community members, and as teachers, and as administrators, and as mayor, is to serve our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6385.573s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And there's a great need for our community, because most parents are working parents, for this out-of-school time, educational piece, care piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6395.075s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I think it's building every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6397.175s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And we're not meeting the needs of our community currently, because the staffing, because our program hasn't grown as big as our need has.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6405.617s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I really would like to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6408.828s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: work with different people in the community, not just school people, but people in the community who want to volunteer and invest in making this a great thing for our school system and our community as a whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6421.654s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I don't know which subcommittee should take that on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6428.275s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I really would like to work on that personally, Mayor Burke, so maybe you could put some thought into that while you're looking at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6434.999s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, thank you for your time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6437.201s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And one last thing, since we're on suspension of rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6440.223s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We're still on this paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6441.363s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, when we're done, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6443.745s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6492.566s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6494.687s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The dedication of the band room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6496.368s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know I discussed it with former superintendent and Mayor Burke last year about dedicating the band, the possibility of dedicating the band room to Lina Gigentomaso, who was a 30 year school committee member who really advocated for the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6514.817s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: those students in the fine arts department in that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6518.439s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'd like to make a motion for the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6591.931s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I agree in following that, and I want to do it correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6596.573s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Timing would be good to move forward quicker than not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6602.515s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6604.536s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And it was requested, again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6608.29s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: last year through the superintendent and the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6612.112s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It wasn't on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6613.413s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It wasn't on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6614.253s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Let's do something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6615.694s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I asked them to look into it months ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6639.648s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Maybe we could have it before the meeting and then bring it to the floor that night?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6665.204s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'd like to respectfully request that if we do need to have a committee of the whole, that we could do that prior to the next meeting, like right an hour before, and then go into the meeting, and if so warranted by our committee, move forward with it at that meeting and vote it on, so that way it can take place<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6683.984s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: on the following meeting, which would be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6700.687s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7026.406s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7026.506s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It will be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7031.236s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That was one of my questions, is when that will be presented to the school committee, as well as, is the bistro open?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7272.463s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you for the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7273.523s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's really good for us to see where we're at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7276.084s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: There are a few areas of concern to me, as far as numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7280.747s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: In Medford, we like to keep them down and low, and we've been successful in doing that for a lot of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7286.274s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So the area that looks a little high to me, the Roberts Kindergarten classes with 22, that's a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7293.236s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm just hoping, do they have full-time aides in those classrooms on all four of those?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7314.351s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, and what about EL students that aren't in there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7317.154s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Are they counted in there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7322.439s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, so my other concern in that same school is the third grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7326.943s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They only have three third grade classes, and they're all 22 and 23.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7333.249s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: If more students were to matriculate to that school, those numbers wouldn't,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7368.087s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7369.862s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just like to highlight that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7371.422s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: My other question is, when parents fill out emergency cards and parent information, a couple of parents have told me that they've filled out these cards a few times now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7386.125s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And isn't it done electronically?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7388.065s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Don't we have school brains?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7389.285s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Does the parent portal for the school brains work?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7391.806s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And don't parents go online?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7394.126s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know at our school, all parents register online, and if they don't have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7398.745s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: access to that, we have special nights for parents to come in and we help them do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7403.187s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that way, if a new student's added or, you know, if you need a class list, you can print it out on, you know, as a teacher, it's helpful, and has emergency contact information on one sheet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7416.974s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And parents aren't required to fill out those little cards over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7421.617s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, I'm not sure what the little cards are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7541.758s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Well, my point is that we invested all this money into this programming that has so many options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7547.183s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I think it's good for us to move forward in that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7550.566s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And it's more convenient for most parents now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7557.333s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And of course, there are going to be some parents that need assistance with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7560.736s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But you could have assistance night or registration night and help them with the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7565.461s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And then you're also educating them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7567.273s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: because as children get older, they use that for homework assignments, they use that for other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7571.717s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So starting that in the beginning and moving forward in that direction is really where I want to see us moving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7578.962s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Plus, you know, we have parents, you know, filling out so many things repeatedly, the same things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7584.727s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: If you have three kids and you're given that form three times, that's nine times you're filling out the same information and it gets, I got a call about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7594.074s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Also, Parent Information Center,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7596.666s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I talked to the superintendent quite a bit this summer about the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7602.05s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I had a family member go through the process, so I got like a bird's eye view.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7607.134s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I would like to streamline that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7608.675s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I would like to have some way, and our superintendent's on it, and I just wanna commend her for her responsiveness to not only my questions, but people's needs there, as well as maybe the EL department in talking to them about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7626.44s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: really having some way to welcome families and help them through that process as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7655.352s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, and even through the summer, I think it's really difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7658.434s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And maybe opening different times for working parents, because our community is changing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7684.726s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I also want to support the people that are working there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7687.429s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't want to, you know, fry them because they spend good time talking to each parent to make sure that they're onboarded well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7695.972s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: and I just, that's our parents' first step into our community, so we really need to do that well, we need to present that well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7704.315s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And again, I just want to commend people for the work they've done and just keep moving forward to getting that better as we serve our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7713.138s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8501.663s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you for offering that to our EL students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8503.984s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know it was the first year for that program, and then I heard about it, and children and families were very pleased that they had that opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8512.166s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8513.607s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: My other question is, did our vocational programming offer any summer programming?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8519.809s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Sometimes they do that for eighth graders to get them interested in different things coming up to the vocational school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8526.491s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'm not sure if that happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8527.852s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I didn't see it on this list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8529.402s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But I believe in years past that those programs were offered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8533.744s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So maybe we could get an update on that and find out if that was offered this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8546.992s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm just curious how many students are taking place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8553.375s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8554.836s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8555.517s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8556.677s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you, Diane.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8940.384s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8941.004s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I did get one call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8942.885s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It was only one call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8943.845s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's two students that are on one side of the street, and the bus goes around very far to pick them up rather than letting the students cross the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8952.548s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's up near Grove or Salt and Saw.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8954.988s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't know that area very well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8957.589s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm sure it's a safety issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8959.149s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't know if they've talked to you directly about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8961.509s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Other than that, it's a great start because usually I get a lot of calls or emails.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8967.393s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: If they were to speak with you, maybe there was some way that we could look at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8974.157s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And my other question is the late bus that the Columbus School, because they had the, I know we added it at the end of last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8982.362s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just want to make sure that those students have that opportunity again this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8987.305s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Remember they were staying late?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8988.806s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That was a special program?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9008.344s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9009.324s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I thought it met a couple different needs over there, but if it does arise, we'll talk about it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9015.006s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9015.406s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9326.676s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Move the bus stop up or down a street?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9331.538s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We'll review all the options on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9333.818s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9535.555s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: DiBenedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9536.355s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9538.176s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I was gonna motion to accept it, but my colleagues already have, but could we also send a letter of thank you to the Palumbo family for this kind donation<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9550.149s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It looks like it's going to continue for years to come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9643.436s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And there's no conflict since they are a renter of that particular school, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9648.239s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9648.319s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9648.819s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just wanted to check that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9650.22s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And is this just specifically for the McGlynn, or is it for the district as a whole?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9657.505s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9659.352s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you, motion to approve and letter sent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9805.479s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Our vocational program has a retail program, so why couldn't we look at that as being part of their programming?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9815.524s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The DECA program, the DECA?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9817.465s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Like the marketing and retail, don't we have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9822.547s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, and why can't they sell, why can't we order the school supplies in a similar way and open that up, you know, certain hours?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9833.221s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: at the beginning of the school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9845.085s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I thought that the vocational school, they sell things at a lower level, but there are also kids in that program all the way up through 12th grade that, you know, ordering those supplies and giving them those life skills to manage a situation in that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9860.96s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: might be worth looking at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9862.901s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I mean, that's what we're hoping to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9864.542s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And this is a real-life practice gum, and it would be supervised by that shop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9871.305s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I don't see why not at least discuss that as a possibility with Chad, the director there, and just look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9897.604s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Even if we start small and then grow it, at least we're offering, like, hey, get all your notebooks here instead of at Staples, or all your binders, and just start small and then grow it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9907.872s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I mean, it's a life lesson for students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9911.374s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Our student advocate is here, and we would like to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9956.871s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You could even set up shop at a different spot seasonally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9966.636s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They set up kiosks and malls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9970.418s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Space isn't, I don't think, prohibitive of at least looking at the idea of this in some way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9979.918s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: even if it's a small way that we can help our community and serve the need of our community in their wallets and teach our students at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9990.043s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think it's a growth opportunity that at least should be looked at by the people in that, you know, by the principal of that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10308.176s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So may I work?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10310.977s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: A few things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10311.637s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: First of all, my husband's a union carpenter in Boston and has been for 38 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10317.82s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And he said that throughout the community, they're struggling to bring in younger people into the trades and talented people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10328.047s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We really need to communicate to people in the community the value of these jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10333.989s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And these men and women make six figures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10336.949s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I mean, they make a great living, and they provide well for their families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10342.611s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And Medford was built on the backs of hardworking people from the trades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10348.973s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We were shipbuilders in the beginning, and our commitment to our vocational school in the last few years has been exceptional.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10357.663s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I would really hate to see programming close, so it's appeal to people in the community that might hear this, and maybe to our newspaper to get out the word that Method really wants to offer strong programming to our students, and we need people in the community to step up and help us in any way they can, even if it's, I don't know, if it's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10385.422s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: current companies or graduates that graduated from the HVAC program at vocational school coming back to teach students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10393.965s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And even if we have to offer some of those in the evening instead of the day, I mean, we might have to look outside the box to fill these needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10403.388s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I really don't want to start outsourcing back to Minuteman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10408.65s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We used to pay a million dollars a year in tuition to Minuteman, and then we were left with no money to invest<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10414.598s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: of vocational programming, and we've come so far to offering great programming and great education to all of our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10424.063s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So this, to me, is almost an emergency situation, and we have to work as a team, and I will contact some friends in the industry and see if they can help in any way, and I suggest that all of us do that, and anyone listening that could offer any help to please call us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10442.338s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: This is a great way for a lot of students to move forward in their career.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10446.639s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Children who, you know, college isn't the right choice for them or students that are gonna do both, trade in and college.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10455.662s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I mean, there are so many opportunities here and our community needs this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10460.063s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So it's just a dire emergency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10462.384s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'd also like to know a little ahead of time when we're having these type of issues, maybe earlier in the summer, a quick email or an alert so that we can help<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10472.719s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: in any way we can as committee members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10475.642s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10476.102s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=422.655s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just had a couple questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=426.876s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=427.756s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: On page 5 of 18,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=430.572s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: A little bit more than halfway down, it says, lost books, iPads, and deductibles in the amount of $464.71.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=437.435s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't know if you know what that was for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=438.836s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Page 5 of 18.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=441.397s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: A little bit, teeny bit more than halfway down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=444.919s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Anthony Penta.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=445.359s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that would be, if you found the page, why is it still on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=448.14s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=448.38s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I didn't ask about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=480.796s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=481.256s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mastone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=481.916s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=483.336s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And my second question is on page 7 of 18.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=484.976s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It just says, Timothy,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=489.678s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Bonner tuition and usually it describes what type of tuition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=493.621s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't know if that it's in the amount of looks like it says 53,000 Sorry Okay, usually it says that Special education next to it, so I was just confirming that those are my only questions a motion to approve I just want to ask you a couple of quick questions to you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1111.099s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: A letter of thank you to Cassett and to the embassy, all involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1117.544s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's a great program for our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1119.066s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: A lot of people donate generous things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1122.633s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: come year after year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1123.675s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1644.722s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1645.863s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1646.864s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1647.484s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'd first like to start off talking about the security in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1652.708s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I received a text today from a new parent who works throughout the Commonwealth in and out of schools all the time, and this is the text that I received.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1664.016s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm really impressed by the security measures at Medford schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1669.484s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I've been to four schools and each one has been excellent, much better than other districts I've visited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1674.968s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm really critical about security and you are doing very well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1679.732s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I thought I'd start off on a positive note and just tell you that the changes that we're making, parents are seeing them and they appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1691.762s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because they need to know that their child are entering a building in a safe environment and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1697.19s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Having those monitors at the doors, really, this new parent, she's been to the high school for the Parent Information Center, to the Columbus School, to many, many schools already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1707.574s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And she has nothing but good things to say about the Method Public Schools so far in her experiences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1715.336s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I just thought I'd share that and say, you know, with everything going on, there are a lot of positive things happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1723.079s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that's the positive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1726.82s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: First of all, thank you for financing the band travel, because if we're financing all the travel for the athletics, we should be financing all the travel for our music students as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1739.332s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that's greatly appreciated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1740.933s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you for taking care of that line item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1743.155s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I'm sure as more people retire and people are replaced, more finances will be found to add different things in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1752.297s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: throughout up until September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1753.958s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know you usually say that to us, Mr. Belson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1758.021s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm very happy to see additional textbooks added back to the elementary schools of $1,500.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1763.944s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They were cut $2,500.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1765.625s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's a good step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1767.927s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I really want to watch closely and make sure that the students and the books are in good shape for children to take home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1777.913s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And hopefully that $1,000 cut<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1781.224s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Her elementary school won't affect them too drastically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1786.486s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The crew program, I can't complain there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1789.167s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: My son was one of the first members to row for Method Crew, and he won the first medal for Method Crew.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1796.39s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I think at some point, he'd like to donate it to the case up at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1800.952s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So we did find that recently, and we saved it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1803.473s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'll give that to you, Mayberg.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1805.474s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Maybe you can help me with making that happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1811.788s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: When we saw the amount of money spent on our athletics, some sports cost more than others, and maybe that's something down the road we'll look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1824.375s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But I'm really grateful that we have over 600 children involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1829.097s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And a lot of those children also are involved in band and orchestra, and they do everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1835.44s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So it affects a lot of children throughout the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1840.537s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Fourth grade on, they get to play musical instruments, even recorders before that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1845.56s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But we have great programming both in the athletics and the arts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1851.363s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm glad to see you adjusted the principal salaries so that they seem fair and equitable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1858.407s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So everybody's on the same line item because we made great measures years ago to make sure that stayed that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1868.264s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And then I really, my problem with the budget is a few things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1873.726s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The first is the lack of kindergarten aids, especially as a committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1877.907s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We have for years voiced our concern, and I don't feel like it's been heard or listened to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1883.949s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Or maybe it was heard and just not the same priority as the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1888.27s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I can respect disagreeing on certain things, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1893.871s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Consistently, this committee has voiced concerns of that issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1898.313s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I would have liked to have seen that fixed in this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1904.075s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The maintenance and repairs decrease of 6% seems really crazy to me when I see needs in our buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1912.059s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I talked about it at our committee of the whole meeting, just shades alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1916.741s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You could do a little bit every year with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1920.722s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And they're necessary not only to stop the glare so teachers can teach and people can see the boards, it's also for security reasons when you're in lockdown and shutdown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1933.548s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's a major issue too, because if you can't pull the outside shade and you're in the first floor, someone on the outside of the building can see into the room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1942.112s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I do have concerns with cutting maintenance and repairs at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1949.005s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: If anything, I would like to see more maintenance and more repairs as our buildings age.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1955.289s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And those are my biggest issues, and I'm going to yield to other members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1960.272s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't want to go on and on for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1963.074s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I do think that there was an error this year in the transfer of funds from the budget book.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1971.779s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think that somehow, at the beginning of last year,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1976.555s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The line item was $10,000 difference for the vocational school in one area and $5,000 in a different area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1983.078s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I noticed it at our budget meeting because I had both the previous years and this year's book open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1988.401s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So it might have been lost through the 17-18 school year and then not carried over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1994.604s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But it was in the 17-18 book that they should have carried over $70,000 and $60,000 was carried over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2003.116s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I spoke with the superintendent and he said it was never allocated to them for 17-18.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2008.457s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that's why it said 60 this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2011.197s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think it was a loss of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2012.558s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: 17-18 and another loss this year because not only did they go from the 70 to the 60, they're going down again from the 60.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2023.44s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I just want to pull up the page so I make sure I get the correct information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2029.541s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They were cut from 60 to 55.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2032.249s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So in the last, they're losing 15,000 in that line item, and the same thing happened with their textbooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2039.61s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It was supposed to be 15,000 carried over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2043.051s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I just feel like we need to look at that, and if adjustments need to be made throughout the school year, that they don't have enough money for their instructional supplies, especially out of vocation, because you need lab supplies for biotech.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2061.102s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You need shop supplies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2063.023s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You need iron for the tin lockers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2067.207s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You need carpentry supplies and some of the equipment as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2072.671s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: There's a big cut in vocational budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2077.054s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: My husband's a union carpenter, and he's been up at the vocational school, and he sees that a lot of the shops are still using old machinery and need to be upgraded to see cuts in these areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2090.265s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: is really very difficult for, it's not in the best interest of the education of our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2098.167s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So those are my main issues with this budget and it's very concerning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2103.289s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So based on some of the things I see, I don't see me voting for this budget in the way that it's presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2995.796s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Point of information, Mr. Benedetto?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2997.757s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2998.258s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: A little bit of history.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2999.418s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm the homeless coordinator for another district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3005.162s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So this issue I brought up over the last few years<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3010.342s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And when I was running for state representative, this was an issue that I was going to work on at the House of Representatives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3020.264s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: When I didn't get elected, I sat down with Christine Barber, who is our state representative, and she brought the issue before the House.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3030.166s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And it was unanimously approved for a commission to study this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3038.013s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And that was approved maybe close to three years ago now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3043.277s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I've been recently talking to Pat Jalen and Christine Barber.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3048.66s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Actually, Christine texted me yesterday to discuss this commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3054.204s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I also spoke with someone who has the ear of the governor and asked him to bring the commission forward instead of appointing it, and how I really want a seat on that commission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3068.783s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And my goal and my dedication to this is to sit on that commission and make changes not only in homeless transportation, but to have a directory of homeless families so that homeless children are placed closer to the communities that they lived in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3085.775s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So yes, we talked about this a little bit at our last meeting, and I talked about my colleagues working with me on this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3095.577s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: really believe that that commission is our next step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3099.818s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm totally for your motion to try things that way as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3105.76s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I want to know who's making the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3108.54s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I want to follow the money and see who's getting rich.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3111.101s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because we pay, I'm not sure how much Medford pays, but.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3114.762s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: $260 a day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3115.122s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I like to break it down a day per child to drive them to and from a shelter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3126.543s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Sometimes less if there's two kids in a car or a family of children, then it could be like 160 per child per day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3134.226s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: With that amount of money, you could rent them an apartment, buy their clothes and their food, and really take care of them in a lot of different ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3143.83s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But that's not legislated yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3146.03s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And the only way we're going to change this is through legislation and through active participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3151.993s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I really believe that that's the method that I choose to work in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3155.909s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But I'll support you in your motion to move forward in this way as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3889.882s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3891.443s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So the superintendent's idea that we do vote for the bottom line of the budget, yes, we vote for the bottom line of the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3899.307s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But we also have been asking and giving our priorities over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3904.129s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I don't think that this budget reflects the priorities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3908.27s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The maintenance, we walked every building a couple years ago and made a list that we still have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3914.354s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We've talked repeatedly about the importance of the foundation of education in kindergarten age.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3920.958s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So the list, like the capital budget list, who's giving, is it coming to us or created by us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3928.282s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because this budget came to us, it wasn't created by us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3931.564s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because I feel like our priorities aren't in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3936.249s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: This has been drafted and given to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3939.012s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And we can just verbally say, well, we wish we had this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3943.337s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Well, I'm voting on what I want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3946.22s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I'm voting on kindergarten aides and maintenance cuts and vocational cuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3953.928s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And because those priorities are my priorities and the priorities of the people I represent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3958.997s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And they wouldn't want me to vote on a bottom line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3961.538s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They wanted me to make sure that the things that are important to them are in this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3965.679s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And if they're not, they want me to vote not, not on a number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3969.46s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that's how I vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3970.68s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't interpret it the same way as the superintendent has presented it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3974.241s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that, that, I just wanted to clarify that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4373.567s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Item two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4374.827s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4376.027s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4378.153s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It reminded me of a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4381.596s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We spoke a little bit at our last meeting about the Roberts School ground cover for the playground, and I was just wondering if it was sent out for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4399.389s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think they said this morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4404.393s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: No, no, no, no, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4406.939s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Oh, okay, you wouldn't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6844.508s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Erin DiBenedetto, 21 Dearborn Street, and also a member of the Medford School Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6850.152s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm here because Cheryl brought this forward through CPA funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6854.648s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It is on your agenda, so we're not asking for something, for you to vote on something that's not already on your agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6860.172s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's on your agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6861.432s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The information, this program was approved by CPA funds and is coming before you tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6868.417s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So they're coming to you as a group packet, and we didn't know that this item was going to be tabled until your committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6876.442s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I respectfully ask you to vote on this one issue while you have the applicant in front of you can answer any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6884.951s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: All of this is gonna be managed through the administration at Medford High School and the Building and Grounds Department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6891.756s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: If bids need to be made, they need to go out, so the timing for those has to be appropriated as well as, you know, that's gonna slow down our process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6901.384s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Our goal here is to make sure that it's safe for our children to return to that playground day one in September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6908.37s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And that's our only goal for asking you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6910.741s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: to move forward with your agenda item that you have before you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6913.963s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And any information I can help with or the applicant can help with, Cheryl Rodriguez, we're here to answer any and all questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6921.566s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I just ask for your consideration for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7607.133s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Our hope was to have this process already be completed, so we were hoping to be up and running before any child came back onto that school yard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7615.838s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Now that we thought this CPA money was going at our last CPA meeting, which was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7623.615s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We thought it was gonna come before this board much sooner, so we hadn't had those discussions as to whether we would wait a whole year or we would try to do it around the school children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7635.38s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's gonna be very difficult, especially at that time of the year with outdoor recess and really giving children the opportunity to be outside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7645.624s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We've all known and we've toured many of the school playgrounds and that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7651.854s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: they're in, they've been patched, they've been, their lifetime has, this is a pilot program for all of our schools, and this issue has to be addressed for the safety of the children, and it's a community project as well, because there are so many children in that neighborhood that use it as their parking into the evenings for working parents as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7688.205s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Ten days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7868.92s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just want to thank you for hearing us this evening and even the consideration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7873.042s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I also want to publicly thank Cheryl Rodriguez for all the time and effort, 65 page application, multiple meetings, at least 10 that I know of, and I've attended as many as I can to help be supportive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7888.523s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: the school community is gonna really benefit because of all the work that she's done, and she should be commended for her work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7897.549s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=580.713s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I was just wondering how many people buzzed their heads last year and what's your goal for this year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=646.66s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So will you guys get buzzed at John Brewer's, or wait and get buzzed at Gillette?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1193.657s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1193.757s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Benedetto?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1194.817s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: First of all, I just wanted to express how impressed I am with your presentation and how comfortable you seem coming up to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1207.041s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The colored pictures, really knowing all your facts and also giving your own personal reasons why it would matter to you really brings that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1218.05s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: emotional piece, huh?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1219.63s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just want at this time to motion to approve the apple orchard and all the other fruit at Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1231.073s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think it's a great hands-on learning opportunity for not only our high school students, but also all students educated there, especially our early childhood students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1241.134s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So at this time, I make that motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2170.264s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2172.786s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2174.162s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2174.922s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Diane, we were talking recently about after school and before school programming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2181.425s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Were there a lot of new enrollees with this kindergarten open houses for those programs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2187.847s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Are we going to be able to accommodate all of our students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2231.344s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2232.244s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We did get an email from a prospective new parent for next year, and they were concerned especially about the capability of after school care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2243.21s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So we are going to assure that all new students that enroll are probably going to have a spot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2284.925s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And when would we know and be able to tell parents?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2289.047s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because I'm sure if they don't qualify for an after school program, they need as much notice as possible to have a safe place for their children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2733.49s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2734.61s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm really glad that we were able to offer this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2737.511s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: This came about because of MCAF scores.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2740.412s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And was there any?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2743.943s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: growth, any way to show growth from the beginning of the program for the students to the end of the program?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2793.629s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Also, when I saw the amount of absences, maybe some regulations within the program, like if you're absent more than, if it's a six-week program, if you're absent more than three times, we're gonna give your spot to the next person on the wait list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2807.414s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And like maybe have a contract for people rather than, you know, inconsistency, because the real, we wanna put people that have the opportunity to grow in those spots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2835.528s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I have two more questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2837.569s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: One is, what was the cost involved, so that way we could plan for next year, because I do think that this may be necessary, depending on MCAT scores, and we'll know that in October, or maybe a little sooner, when the superintendents<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2852.905s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: get that data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2864.187s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The cost of the teachers, is that right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2867.408s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Could we get a report of a breakdown of that through the mayor to the superintendent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2872.729s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Could we get a report of the cost involved so that way we can make it a priority during our budget season?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2879.47s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And then like, you know, or if math,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2883.624s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: coaches or during the day type situation might be more affordable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2889.468s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But I like the idea of having a later time at different schools for kids to go home and they can take advantage of other programming, not just this programming at the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2900.995s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's a great advantage for students that have no other way home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2924.291s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So we should know how much the bus was utilized, and if it's necessary, or a smaller bus, or any ways that we could save money and still provide the programming and not be wasteful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2937.168s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So my last question is really not to both of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2940.81s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The need of this came out because of last year's, especially former fifth graders, scores on MCAS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2949.075s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'd like to know how we're continuing to follow those students in the sixth grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2955.059s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And if anybody is checking in, I know we've asked before and reports were given to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2959.762s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Now that we're getting closer to the end of the year,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2962.126s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think that we should have an update on those students and make sure that they received everything they needed for this current MCAS that they just took.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2969.872s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And we want a report on how those specific students did as soon as we get the release of their MCAS scores to make sure those students don't fall through any cracks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2981.421s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2981.982s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Are you referring to the current fifth grade students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3002.538s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm just asking for a follow up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3004.94s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Now that they've completed their MCAS, I wanna see the growth from their fifth grade to their sixth grade MCAS scores and make sure that every student that might not have done well last year is moving and showing growth, and if not, they get the services they need in any way, shape, or form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3022.124s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That we don't- Next fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3023.444s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3025.064s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Right, so if that could be added to the reports request list for October.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3031.085s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just wanna make sure we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3034.55s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: don't drop a link.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3035.771s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3038.272s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4262.126s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4263.286s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4264.166s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So, so you're proposing,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4266.772s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: that students pay the $18 or $20 per thing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4278.439s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, so a few questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4281.101s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Number one, students can pay for it, and it's either $18 or $20 per test.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4285.223s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Students are already paying for their AP exams, which are what, at least 63 last time I- No, they're more like 95.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4291.887s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, so that's over $100<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4295.802s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: for just their language, not counting any other AP that they might be taking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4301.105s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Also, the $2,000 that's allocated in your budget report, is that the cost of the seal?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4306.767s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Is that the-<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4313.761s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And if there is a cost, is it annually?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4323.328s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We don't have those answers yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4325.369s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Is that something you heard, or is that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4336.695s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: can we wait till we get more information from DESC about the cost involved and what's involved?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4804.067s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4805.048s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4806.209s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mrs. DeCarlo, do you know what the breakdown of students are?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4809.251s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: How many children at Medford High School are in Spanish, French, and Italian?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4818.42s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, I'm just curious, like, what students, and do students get to pick what they want as freshmen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4824.425s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4825.185s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4826.006s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Especially because we don't offer French at the middle schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4829.609s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'm wondering if that has any impact on the environment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4850.486s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, so is there any way that, I know that you're retiring soon, is there any way that you could provide us with that breakdown, even in an email?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4858.73s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4859.07s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Just so we can plan, and I wanna see how strong the programs are, and where the interest is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4871.397s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Oh, that would be awesome, thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4876.358s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: you send him to the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4877.938s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm sure he's happy to email us that if that's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4881.059s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4882.82s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4909.261s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And especially now, because a few years ago we changed the program so that students take languages all six days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4916.603s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Instead of, they used to have five day block, like five out of the six day block.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4923.11s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4923.551s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4923.951s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Your report was very thorough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4925.332s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4926.153s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know your level of funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4928.054s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just personally, I've known you for many, many years and I can't thank you enough for not only the academic service that you've given these students, but the global opportunities in taking them across the other side of the world and touring Italy and Spain and really giving them an opportunity and seeing the world outside of MedFed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4951.093s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm very grateful for those opportunities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4953.615s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just wish I had gone with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4964.025s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that's my only regret.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4966.407s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And thank you very much for your time and dedication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5205.179s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So will the incoming superintendent be part of this process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5210.624s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: In what way, Mr. Bellson?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5221.692s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: she'll be there for the interview process and for the decision making.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6099.745s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6099.985s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Vander Ploet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7180.854s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you for your report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7182.235s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And it was very good to see how your first year went and all the initiatives that you put forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7188.681s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you for all of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7190.923s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm seeing an increase in EL programs throughout the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7195.727s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I know you commented that we have 40 new students from the beginning of this year till now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7201.192s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: How many students throughout our district are EL students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7208.127s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So what is that, 10, 11% district-wide, not just at the McGlynn, but?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7214.832s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: District-wide, so 11% of our students, and rising yearly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7222.999s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Right, and this almost matches it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7224.6s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Matches it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7225.261s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, so it's indicative of the whole district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7229.844s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So with it, with the growth that we've seen in the last, what, three to five years,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7236.527s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think that we need to pre-plan for more EL programs and to have a short-term plan for EL and a long-term plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7247.036s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So as the new superintendent comes forward, I'd love to see that and maybe the curriculum subcommittee to talk about this so we can start putting those, I said years ago that EL is gonna be bigger than special education as far as, or equal to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7263.887s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: as far as programming and some of the programming that you're talking about, the required PAC or DAC, whichever one you choose, and all of those things seem to be following in line of how the special education programs are run throughout the district and their requirements, at least I see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7302.316s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: per child per teacher ratios as far as state requirements?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7359.808s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And as far as our teachers that need<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7364.56s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: EL training or certification for the retail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7370.185s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Are we on track with that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7371.406s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: How do we track that for teachers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7373.508s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7385.679s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I'm sure the 15 required hours in EL has helped.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7390.942s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: with that, with re-licensure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7409.033s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'm not going to make an official motion for you to meet with the curriculum subcommittee, but in September or October, maybe,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7418.49s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: we could regroup and possibly ask the chairperson to call a meeting and just have short-term and long-term goals with the new superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7427.138s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: She may have some different ideas, having been an instructional superintendent for 15 schools and EL is a big<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7435.837s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: commitment there in Boston as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7498.735s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And my final question is, have you gotten any feedback from the McGlynn teachers about the change that's gonna take place next year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7507.6s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Have they been informed, any feedback?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7511.471s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: How are they, in general, feeling about it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7513.532s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They've had a lot of change through the year, and I just want to make sure that they're incorporated in the communication as well as decision-making.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7558.191s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And what's the overall<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7582.24s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you for being so inclusive with that situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7585.481s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's important for that community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7588.323s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: A great report, thank you, and I motion to accept the report and place it on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7918.899s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7921.26s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7922.261s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7922.801s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I had a few questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7924.802s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Bilson, why in number one, did you emphasize area university?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7951.778s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I mean, I imagine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7952.278s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Could you define how far in the area you're talking?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7956.02s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because that way, we're all on the same page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7971.035s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'd just like to be on the same page with this because interpretation can be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7988.925s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I mean- So my next question is in section four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7993.008s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Why did it change from us being responsible for the renovations and oversight of the renovations to now<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8027.139s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8030.738s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, my last question is for our attorney that's in the audience tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8036.403s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm wondering if this is different in any way than any other RFP that we usually do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8045.999s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I mean, you mentioned that you went into town and talked to the people there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8053.865s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Is it the time frame that's shorter?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8055.466s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because you made it seem like it was a little bit different than the usual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8080.486s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8081.326s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And my last question is, is two weeks a typical time frame for an RFP to be posted?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8087.471s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8092.635s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So a week?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8094.617s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8095.137s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And do we advertise this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8097.019s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: How do we have to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8098.079s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Oh, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8103.21s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Are we telling of any of our neighbor communities?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8107.131s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Are we reaching out and saying, hey, we're looking for a partnership and this is what we're looking for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8668.185s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8840.482s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I was going to ask, have you been able to view of any groups<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10350.167s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I didn't push my button, but I think it's a tough call for this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10357.672s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I'm just listening to some of the members on the committee with children close to this age.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10364.437s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I'm just taking in the information at this point and just seeing what's best for the community as a whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10370.774s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think that both schools are very good schools in that eventually people will be happy, but I think it's difficult for any parent or any child to swallow a change this late in the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10383.859s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I hope that we move to make a total lottery at some point for these schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10391.241s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And my colleague, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10394.022s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Stone, called that way back when.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10397.538s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I was like, you're crazy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10399.519s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And she actually turned out to be right on the money, and she was getting phone calls on the way to that last meeting saying, don't you vote for a lottery by people that have supported her through the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10413.168s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'm sitting here, and that's what I'm thinking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10417.571s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'm hoping to learn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11781.227s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11782.415s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: My only concern with this is a lot of our population could be single parents that might want something brought forward, and they can't leave their children unattended to attend these meetings, but they could be watching it at home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11796.899s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I agree that less use is best, less is best in this forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11804.4s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Maybe I do agree that announcing who it was, if it's commented on or looked at,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11810.779s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: throughout the meeting and not later, then I do agree that that should be announced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11816.742s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But there are people that don't have the ability to leave their home at seven o'clock at nighttime because they're not able, and they're not gonna bring their children out at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11827.146s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that would be a concern to me, that people wanted to speak about an item and we're not reaching them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11834.009s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's my only concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=590.134s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I was just wondering how many people buzzed their heads last year and what's your goal for this year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=646.597s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So will you guys get buzzed at John Brewer's, or wait and get buzzed at Gillette?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1193.558s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1193.778s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Benedetto?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1194.839s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: First of all, I just wanted to express how impressed I am with your presentation and how comfortable you seem coming up to the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1207.063s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The colored pictures, really knowing all your facts, and also giving your own personal reasons why it would matter to you really brings that emotional peace home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1219.668s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just wanted this time to motion to approve<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1223.471s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: the apple orchard and all the other fruit at Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1231.095s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think it's a great hands-on learning opportunity for not only our high school students, but also all students educated there, especially our early childhood students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1241.159s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So, at this time, I make that motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2172.808s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2174.198s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2174.938s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Diane, we were talking recently about after school and before school programming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2181.461s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Were there a lot of new enrollees with this kindergarten open houses for those programs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2187.864s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Are we going to be able to accommodate all of our students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2231.36s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2232.261s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We did get an email from a prospective new parent for next year, and they were concerned especially about the capability of after school care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2243.246s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So we are going to assure that all new students that enroll are probably going to have a spot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2284.942s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And when would we know and be able to tell parents?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2289.065s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because I'm sure if they don't qualify for an after school program, they need as much notice as possible to have a safe place for their children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2733.501s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2734.641s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm really glad that we were able to offer this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2737.202s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: This came about because of MCAF scores, and was there any,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2743.98s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: growth, any way to show growth from the beginning of the program for the students to the end of the program?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2793.663s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Also, when I saw the amount of absences, maybe some regulations within the program, like if you're absent more than, if it's a six-week program, if you're absent more than three times, we're gonna give you a spot to the next person on the wait list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2807.448s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And maybe have a contract for people rather than inconsistency, because the real, we wanna put people that have the opportunity to grow in those spots, and we don't wanna.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2835.545s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I have two more questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2837.586s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: One is what was the cost involved, so that way we could plan for next year, because I do think that this may be necessary, depending on MCAT scores, and we'll know that in October, or maybe a little sooner when the superintendents<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2852.922s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: get that data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2864.204s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The cost of the teachers, is that right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2867.425s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Could we get a report of a breakdown of that through the mayor to the superintendent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2872.746s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Could we get a report of the cost involved so that way we can make it a priority during our budget season?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2879.507s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And then like, you know, or if math,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2883.641s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: coaches or during the day type situation might be more affordable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2889.505s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But I like the idea of having a later time at different schools for kids to go home and they can take advantage of other programming, not just this programming at the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2901.012s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's a great advantage for students that have no other way home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2924.325s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So we should know how much the bus was utilized, and if it's necessary, or a smaller bus, or any ways that we could save money and still provide the programming and not be wasteful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2937.205s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So my last question is really not to both of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2940.828s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The need of this came out because of last year's, especially former fifth graders, scores on MCAS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2949.096s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'd like to know how we're continuing to follow those students in the sixth grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2955.081s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And if anybody is checking in, I know we've asked before and reports were given to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2959.785s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Now that we're getting closer to the end of the year,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2962.143s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think that we should have an update on those students and make sure that they received everything they needed for this current MCAS that they just took.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2969.909s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And we want a report on how those specific students did as soon as we get the release of their MCAS scores to make sure those students don't fall through any cracks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2981.438s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2981.999s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Are you referring to the current fifth grade students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3002.253s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm just asking for a follow-up now that they've completed their MCAS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3007.017s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I want to see the growth from their fifth grade to the sixth grade MCAS scores and make sure that every student that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3013.472s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: might not have done well last year is moving and showing growth, and if not, they get the services they need in any way, shape, or form that we don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3023.458s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3025.098s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3025.739s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So if that could be added to the reports request list for October.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3031.122s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just want to make sure we don't drop a link.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3036.585s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4262.145s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4263.305s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4264.186s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So, so you're proposing,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4266.788s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: that students pay the $18 or $20 per thing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4270.01s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because students already pay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4278.476s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, so a few questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4281.117s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Number one, students can pay for it, and it's either $18 or $20 per test.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4285.24s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Students are already paying for their AP exams, which are what, at least 63 last time I knew.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4289.883s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: No, they're more like 95.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4291.904s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, so that's over $100<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4295.818s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: for just their language, not counting any other AP that they might be taking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4301.121s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Also, the $2,000 that's allocated in your budget report, is that the cost of the seal?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4306.784s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Is that-<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4313.776s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And if there is a cost, is it annually?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4324.005s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Wait a minute, is that something you heard, or is that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4336.712s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: can we wait till we get more information from DESC about the cost involved and what's involved?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4804.087s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4805.068s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4806.25s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mrs. DeCarlo, do you know what the breakdown of students are?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4809.274s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: How many children at Medford High School are in Spanish, French, and Italian?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4818.497s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, I'm just curious, like, what students, and do students get to pick what they want as freshmen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4824.461s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4825.181s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4826.022s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Especially because we don't offer French at the middle schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4829.644s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'm wondering if that has any impact on the other students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4850.52s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, so is there any way that, I know that you're retiring soon, is there any way that you could provide us with that breakdown even in an email?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4858.743s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4859.103s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Just so we can plan and I want to see how strong the programs are and where the interest is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4871.428s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Oh, that would be awesome, thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4876.375s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You send him to the superintendent, I'm sure he's happy to email us that if that's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4881.1s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: He can get them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4909.284s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And especially now, because a few years ago we changed the program so that students take languages all six days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4916.632s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Instead of, they used to have five day block, like five out of the six day block.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4923.127s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4923.568s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4923.948s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Your report was very thorough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4926.169s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know your level of funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4928.071s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just personally, I've known you for many, many years, and I can't thank you enough for not only the academic service that you've given these students, but the global opportunities in taking them across the other side of the world and touring Italy and Spain and really giving them an opportunity and seeing the world outside of MedFit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4951.13s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm very grateful for those opportunities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4953.653s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just wish I had gone with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4964.504s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that's my only regret.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4966.426s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And thank you very much for your time and dedication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5205.187s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So will the incoming superintendent be part of this process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5210.649s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: In what way, Mr. Bellson?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5219.712s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Give us feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5222.093s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: She'll be there for the interview process and for the decision-making process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6099.759s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6100.019s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Vander Ploet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7180.888s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you for your report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7182.269s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And it was very good to see how your first year went and all the initiatives that you put forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7188.694s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you for all of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7190.935s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm seeing an increase in EL programs throughout the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7195.739s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I know you commented that we have 40 new students from the beginning of this year till now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7201.202s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: How many students throughout our district are EL students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7208.143s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So what is that, 10, 11% district-wide, not just at the McGlynn, but?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7214.849s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: District-wide, so 11% of our students, and rising yearly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7222.835s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Right, and this almost matches it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7224.617s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Matches it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7225.277s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, so it's indicative of the whole district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7229.881s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So with it, with the growth that we've seen in the last, what, three to five years,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7236.56s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think that we need to pre-plan for more EL programs and to have a short-term plan for EL and a long-term plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7247.063s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So as the new superintendent comes forward, I'd love to see that and maybe the curriculum subcommittee to talk about this so we can start putting those, I said years ago that EL is gonna be bigger than special education as far as, or equal to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7263.921s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: as far as programming and some of the programming that you're talking about, the required PAC or DAC, whichever one you choose, and all of those things seem to be following in line of how the special education programs are run throughout the district and their requirements, at least I see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7302.353s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: per child per teacher ratios as far as state requirements?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7359.837s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And as far as our teachers that need EL training or certification for the retail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7370.199s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Are we on track with that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7371.42s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: How do we track that for teachers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7373.522s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7385.71s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I'm sure the 15 required hours in EL has helped.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7390.956s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: with that, with re-licensure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7409.049s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'm not going to make an official motion for you to meet with the curriculum subcommittee, but in September or October, maybe,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7418.507s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: we could regroup and possibly ask the chairperson to call a meeting and just have short-term and long-term goals with the new superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7427.174s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: She may have some different ideas, having been an instructional<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7432.012s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: superintendent for 15 schools in EL is a big commitment there in Boston as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7498.77s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And my final question is, have you gotten any feedback from the McGlynn teachers about the change that's gonna take place next year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7507.534s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Have they been informed, any feedback?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7511.505s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: How are they, in general, feeling about it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7513.547s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They've had a lot of change through the year, and I just want to make sure that they're incorporated in the communication as well as decision-making.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7558.201s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And what's the overall?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7582.257s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you for being so inclusive with that situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7585.518s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's important for that community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7588.34s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: A great report, thank you, and I motion to accept the report and place it on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7918.782s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7921.063s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7922.284s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7922.824s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I had a few questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7924.825s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Bilson, why in number one, did you emphasize area university?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7951.802s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Could you define how far in the area you're talking?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7956.024s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that way, we're all on the same page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7971.057s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'd just like to be on the same page with this, because interpretation can be different for different people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7989.782s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So my next question is in section four, why did it change from us being responsible for the renovations and oversight of the renovations to now the bid?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8030.756s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8030.956s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And my last question is for our attorney that's in the audience tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8036.439s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm wondering if this is different in any way than any other RFP that we usually do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8046.016s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I mean, you mentioned that you went into town and talked to the people there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8053.88s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Is it the time frame that's shorter?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8055.481s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because you made it seem like it was a little bit different than the usual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8080.516s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8081.336s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And my last question is, is two weeks a typical time frame for an RFP to be posting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8087.497s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8094.618s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8095.139s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And do we advertise this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8097.139s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Oh yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8103.247s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Are we telling of any of our neighbor communities?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8107.15s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Are we reaching out and saying, hey, we're looking for a partnership and this is what we're looking for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8114.636s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Publicly post it and see what comes back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8841.532s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I was going to ask, have you made any assumption of any groups of students coming into the classroom that may increase the numbers of changes in a way that might be this 21 assumption?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8856.518s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It could be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10350.18s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I didn't push my button, but I think it's a tough call for this committee, and I'm just listening to some of the members on the committee with children close to this age, and I'm just taking in the information at this point and just seeing what's best for the community as a whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10370.813s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think that both schools are very good schools in that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10376.444s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Eventually people will be happy, but I think it's difficult for any parent or any child to swallow a change this late in the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10383.888s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I hope that we move to make a total lottery at some point for these schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10391.251s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And my colleague, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10394.052s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Stone, called that way back when.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10397.574s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I was like, you're crazy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10399.535s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And she actually turned out to be right on the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10403.817s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And she was getting phone calls on the way<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10405.874s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: to that last meeting saying, don't you vote for a lottery by people that have supported her through the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10413.178s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'm sitting here and that's what I'm thinking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10417.6s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'm hoping to learn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11781.257s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11782.432s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: My only concern with this is a lot of our population could be single parents that might want something brought forward, and they can't leave their children unattended to attend these meetings, but they could be watching it at home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11796.915s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I agree that less use is best, less is best in this forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11804.417s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Maybe I do agree that announcing who it was, if it's commented on or looked at,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11810.793s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: throughout the meeting and not later, then I do agree that that should be announced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11816.756s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But there are people that don't have the ability to leave their home at seven o'clock at nighttime because they're not able, and they're not gonna bring their children out at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11827.162s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that would be a concern to me, that people wanted to speak about an item and we're not reaching them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11834.025s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's my only concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=1642.123s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just have a comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=1649.06s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just want to comment how I appreciate you ending with the positives of the McGlynn School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=1659.65s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think there are teachers in the room and in the community who are going to watch this and to end on a positive note, especially with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=1670.88s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: perception that the other school was getting more and more with, I thought, was very supportive of teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=1678.724s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And as a student, I just wanted to pay attention to that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=1684.246s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=1823.744s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Just a point of history, Medgard was one of the first schools in Massachusetts to have full day kindergarten.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=1831.209s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I would love us to offer a pre-K program and really push the state towards university pre-K.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=1837.113s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I feel like that's the foundation of education and I would love to be on the forefront of that within the Commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=1844.217s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I do like you thinking outside of the box because we have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=1848.54s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: someone had brought a suggestion to us to make one middle school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=1854.125s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And that was something that I was interested in at that point, a while ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=1858.148s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Someone had suggested that, we had talked about that as a committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=1863.132s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The buildings itself would have to be changed because the bathrooms, it was not cost effective, but this is a different way to look at that, and I really,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=1874.341s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's very interesting and very intriguing to me as a planer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=1878.025s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes, it would be a long-term plan, but I think it's a great plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=4824.486s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I did not bring kids back to the school if the school was not back up and operating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=70.819s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=73.722s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1460.588s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1461.348s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Hi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1462.309s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Nice to meet you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1464.511s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1465.611s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: My first question is pretty specific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1469.615s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm sure you looked at some of our data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1472.166s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And what is your plan to increase the academic growth at each level of our educational system?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1479.65s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So our elementary, middle, and high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1486.773s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1487.373s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: To increase academic scores or rigor in any way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1491.115s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Like if you saw by looking at our data areas that you felt that needed growth and attention at this point, and what kind of ideas do you have to help us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1499.98s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I saw in your resume that you were able to bring schools up to level one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1505.803s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And just the type of things, based on our data, if you had a chance to look at that, if you had any specific ideas or examples.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2074.994s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you, that's an excellent answer to my question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2079.199s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You know your stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4456.873s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4458.053s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4462.718s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Part of my question was already asked, but could you tell me any experience you might have with collective bargaining?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4556.978s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4558.579s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: My second question is professional development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4562.605s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: just your philosophy on it and how it's implemented where you are, if you have any ideas for our school district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4687.66s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So speaking of vision, do you have a district vision for MedFed, or an idea of what you think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4694.414s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: that you would like to see us, how you would like to see us grow?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7138.097s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7141.186s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7141.686s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Nice to meet you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7144.288s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Could you just elaborate on some of your experience with collective bargaining and large scale budget development?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7406.636s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Great, thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7408.036s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7408.416s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7408.516s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Kritz?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=10589.718s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=10590.959s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=10592.96s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I have a question regarding academic growth for our students here in MedFed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=10598.762s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=10600.143s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So could you tell me what kind of plans you would put in place for each level of our educational system, like our elementary, our middle, and our high school students, based on any of the data that you had a chance to review?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=769.089s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Do we have two questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=770.149s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We'll go around again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=772.95s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=773.491s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Hi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=774.111s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=779.091s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: What is your plan to increase academic growth at each level of our educational system?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=784.679s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Like, could you list your priority actions for each level, elementary, middle, and high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2153.235s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2155.456s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Hey again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2156.236s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Hello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2157.717s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So could you please elaborate on your experience with collective bargaining and a large scale budget development?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2165.621s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4736.105s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Venditto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4737.025s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4739.586s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So in our district, we have an alternative high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4743.588s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And it's very separate from where we are here at this high school and our vocational high school are very close together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4753.773s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Could you think of a few ways that we could open up our program to the high school and vice versa to have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4762.253s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: make sure that those students feel like they are a true Mustang?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7085.799s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you, Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7087.279s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Can I just follow up with a question on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7090.6s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So, Dr. Parla, could you tell me which parts of the collaboration of the vocational school and the high school have your actual fingerprints on it, just so we have concrete examples of what you did in that process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7157.039s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7158.499s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'd like to go forward with my question, is what's your plan to increase academic growth at each level of an educational system?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7167.902s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Please list for me some of your priority actions for our elementary, middle, high school, vocational school, and Curtis Tufts School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7352.79s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7353.17s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Follow-up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7358.382s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I did, I did have a follow up on that if that's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7363.046s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So, so I was referring pretty much towards testing scores and what actual programs and how could we, you know, get our academic achievement up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7373.615s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I have become aware that this year there have been more eighth grade applications to outside school districts other than our high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7381.402s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I was wondering if you could give us any information or your viewpoint on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7483.52s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7484.54s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=8458.208s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Just to follow up with the idea that you just brought forward, so with carpentry and math, can you tell me how, I mean, it's a great concept, but how do we execute that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=9813.267s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=9814.668s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So my official second question is, please elaborate on your experience with collective bargaining and large-scale budget development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10505.94s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I know over the recent years you have made some changes to the homework policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10517.049s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Could you go over your beliefs in that and why you've made those changes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=124.009s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I had a few questions on page 5 of 10.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=130.236s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Third item down, it says Motty's Caterers, and then the account description says Textbooks DW.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=137.265s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm sure it was just maybe an error.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=139.667s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't think we're paying Motty's Caterers for textbooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=159.293s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: OK, and the other one is on the next page, page six of 10, about 10 items down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=166.754s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It says North Shore Rental, Inc.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=168.775s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And it also says Textbooks DW.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=173.375s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Other than that, they look great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=175.376s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I think it just could have been clicked differently or some easy error.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=180.737s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Oh, someone has something to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=184.748s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Bernadette raised her hand like she wanted to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=187.51s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mrs. Riccadeli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=217.579s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So will we get a correction on that when the money's transferred from one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=229.567s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And we'll get notification of that happening, or our secretary?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=241.476s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=242.163s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And we don't get no, we don't not required to get no, I don't know how that works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=248.466s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=248.987s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just, when it comes up like that, I just question it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=254.389s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=255.43s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=278.848s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you, Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=280.609s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: An item last week, last meeting that was brought up that was tabled asking for the payroll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=288.292s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Kirsten was nice enough to get that together and send it to us last Friday afternoon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=293.614s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I put it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=296.137s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You know, it was a really busy weekend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=298.419s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I was looking at wedding gowns with my daughter, so I didn't get to this till late yesterday and was at work today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=304.624s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I just emailed everybody a copy of this report that I put on your desk with some concerns on base salaries for some employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=314.272s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I know Kirsten didn't have a chance to review this ahead of time, and again, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=320.418s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Oh, Kirsten, I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=322.439s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=323.813s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I have highlighted some concerns when I compared the salary to the budget book.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=333.855s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I didn't do everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=335.415s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I did like three teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=336.515s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They were all correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=337.575s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I did some administrators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=339.196s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They looked pretty good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=341.036s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The areas that I saw a pattern, I kept looking more and more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=346.017s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And in the finance department, there were a lot of admin assistants or secretaries that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=352.421s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: their base pay didn't look the same as our budget book.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=356.264s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So, I can give you a couple examples.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=358.285s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know you have the packet in front of you as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=380.341s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Right, in that budget,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=382.225s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: This book that was approved was including those increases for all staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=387.706s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And not all staff received the increase, so everybody would receive an increase, and that's not the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=393.347s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The differences are random.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=395.848s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Some people got them, and some others didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=398.168s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So it would make sense to me if everybody got a step increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=404.37s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But some people, it looks like it could be two or three steps, and some people are one step, and some people have no raise increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=411.855s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So it's concerning, and we're responsible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=415.836s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We vote on this payroll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=416.996s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We should know what is right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=419.037s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I'm not a CPA, but I put a spreadsheet together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=422.798s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I didn't look at longevity or overtime, because those are listed out separately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=427.899s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just looked at base pay, because that's what I have in our budget book, and I compared them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=432.76s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I took the salary for that week, multiplied it by 26, which would be the annual income, because I didn't get the year-to-date column.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=440.869s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I just, and I clarified that with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=444.19s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I sent you an email saying, hey, do I multiply this by 24?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=447.251s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Are we bi-monthly or are we bi-weekly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=451.732s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So you said we would buy things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=453.873s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I, late last night, I did it on Excel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=457.514s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I put the gross wages you sent me, the PDF.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=460.435s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I transferred it to an Excel document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=463.816s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I made a formula at taking the gross wages, multiplied it by 26, and got that column.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=470.327s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I kept the check date so that way everybody knew exactly what pay period it was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=475.77s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Then I put in the budget book salary for the people that I checked that I saw differences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=482.853s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Some people aren't being paid enough, and some people are overpaid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=488.076s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I don't want to say names, so I will, like for instance, I will use initials so you can follow along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=493.598s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's all alphabetical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=495.459s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So like on the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=497.475s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Fourth page down, last name C, first name K, it's highlighted so you should be able to find it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=503.617s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Their weekly pay rate was $19.4742.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=506.717s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: If you multiply that by 26 to get the annual, it should be $50,632.92.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=510.178s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The budget book that we approved, their raise included, should be $46,138.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=526.227s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: There's a difference that that person possibly could be overpaid by $4,494 based on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=533.711s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's not including overtime or anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=537.593s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I have 19 examples.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=539.954s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I would have done more, but again, I didn't start this till late yesterday because I got it Friday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=546.438s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I had my aunt and I had<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=549.453s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: wedding dress shopping, which was a lot of fun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=569.285s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes, and I have changes that Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=573.068s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=589.86s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And what I also have is in June 19th of last year, after the budget was approved,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=599.109s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Belson came to a school committee meeting and we went into executive session and he brought forth a list of people he requested 2.5% raises on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=610.375s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I have those lists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=613.096s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Some of them were principals, people who are not under union that he would need to do this for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=620.28s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Some of them were administrators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=623.922s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yours was one of them as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=627.644s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And then,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=628.812s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: He also came forward for some confidential secretaries or administrative assistants that he brought forward that he felt needed to be brought up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=639.917s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And they're not in bargaining.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=641.998s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They're, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=642.918s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And they've all been documented with personnel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=645.419s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And so I have all those documents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=647.1s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So the ones that I'm talking about in these differences are union people who only should be going up the step and some have and some haven't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=656.518s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It should be all or none, because they're in line with the collective bargaining units.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=671.31s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, I have the steps listed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=679.896s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=687.175s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=687.736s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I can appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=689.756s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I would request at this time that we have a meeting of finances as a committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=696.098s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We don't have a subcommittee group, so I would like to send this to the committee of the whole to discuss finances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=701.759s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Now, I know it will have to be televised because we need to, it's public record and it's transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=707.701s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So in lieu of everything, I really think that it's very important that we're very clear<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=714.143s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: and very transparent, especially lately, about what we're doing, and so that the whole community can see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=720.693s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'm requesting that this meeting happen right away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=723.256s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: This involves people's pay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=724.899s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because if people are being paid $4,000 extra,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=729.145s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: What happens if it was a mistake or it was granted when it shouldn't have been?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=733.387s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Do they pay it back?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=734.928s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Do they continue to make it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=737.369s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We have big decisions to make, and this involves people's livelihoods, and I take that extremely seriously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=742.951s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: As do I, as protector of the records and confidentiality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=761.32s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: No, I'm requesting and I'm making a motion for this to be sent to a committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=766.703s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I need one of my colleagues to second my motion, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=780.147s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: These are just the questions I looked at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=782.468s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: These could only be a sampling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=784.009s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: There's people that do owe money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=786.35s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: There's people's longevity that aren't added here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=789.416s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Like there's people, when you figure out their salaries, their longevity is missing from this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=793.697s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I don't know if that's a one-time payment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=798.479s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And again, see, the collective bargaining agreements have documentation that need to be identified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=806.461s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: No, that's what I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=808.582s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm saying some people are underpaid, some people are overpaid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=812.043s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So there's a motion on the floor, Mayor Burke, for us to meet as a committee to discuss finances within the next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=818.605s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think it involves people's pay and it has to be a priority within this committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=894.642s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Just a point of clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=897.003s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: If someone's covering for someone else, they get an overtime salary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=900.384s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They can't change someone's base salary if they're a union person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=904.126s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And you can bring someone in at a higher step, but you can't change someone once they're working more than one step or whatever's negotiated through bargaining, collective bargaining.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=917.131s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You can't do it for one person and not the whole group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=920.772s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that's my understanding, and I'm happy to be corrected if that's not correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=947.597s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I didn't do any teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=948.978s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=955.981s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=956.221s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But my understanding is that the budget book is presented after the increment step increments have been given.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=969.796s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, but then everybody would have that increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=991.04s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Beverly, you're talking more teachers than I'm talking, like, secretarial union.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=999.808s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I've said that three times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1001.869s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I did not look at teachers, and that's not what I'm questioning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1006.774s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's not what's highlighted, and I would like to keep it focused on what I brought forward and not distract from that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1014.397s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I would like to see if one of my members would please second this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1018.979s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Ruggiero seconded your motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1020.5s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: OK, I didn't hear him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1021.361s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1021.701s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1560.361s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1562.217s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just want to thank my colleague.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1563.838s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: This is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1564.999s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: This is really, really nice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1566.359s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I wanted to start with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1568.901s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just had a few questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1570.222s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Are all groups now registered with the school department or will be by April 1st, like the friends of and BTOs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1619.574s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And my follow-up question is about the compliancy policy I read.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1624.677s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So the only, like if someone doesn't register from us, they just can't use the school name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1630.801s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They can be, they'll just no longer be affiliated with us, but they can still run and raise money under a different name, just not like the friends of type thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1643.058s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, I just wanted to be clear on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1645.219s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I really, I like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1646.459s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: This is really, really good work to all involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1650.18s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Very.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1650.4s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank Jenny and Paul and Mike.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1652.76s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Excellent work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1653.801s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you for bringing it forward in your time on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1657.402s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I'm happy to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1667.304s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Oh yeah, we did have it on earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1668.664s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It might take a minute to warm up now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1710.776s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1711.056s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I thought we should have movies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2133.957s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Are the financials a requirement?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2136.678s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I didn't see the asterisk next to that section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2138.959s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2139.32s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Is that something that's being part of the policy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2142.081s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Maybe, Kathy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2178.614s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And that brought up a good second question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2180.856s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: This is going to the superintendent's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2183.538s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So do we have someone there that's going to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2187.204s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: making sure that all the groups are registered and that this is followed through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2191.466s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It seems like an extra task for someone in that department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2195.828s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So maybe that's something that we need to think about and bring forward and talk about in some way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2203.391s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Maybe we can, maybe the superintendent's office will, maybe Deputy Superintendent Nelson can advise us to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2215.812s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: in the future give us a report on who would be in charge of monitoring this information and bringing it forward and like just keeping it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2226.203s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2248.07s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2248.43s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I just wanted to be aware to you and maybe you could provide us a report by October 1st, like who's going to be the responsible person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2258.475s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2259.976s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, so we'll definitely consider that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2262.578s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'll put it on my thing to the back of our agenda list as a report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2267.361s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that way there, we remember to make, remind you that it, you know, we'll help each other remember.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2275.067s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So we are, I'm requesting a report as to who and how we're going to allocate this additional work to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3131.042s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3131.983s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just had a point of information about Tufts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3135.564s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Tufts University is holding a community presentation on Wednesday the 21st to inform the community members about programs and resources available to them and provide an overview of recently completed upcoming projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3152.234s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So it's at 6.30 on the 21st at the Alumni Lounge in Medford<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3159.194s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Somerville Line up on the campus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3162.116s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And they invited the public to come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3164.538s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's 40 Talbot Ave, 630, Wednesday the 21st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3169.381s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Tufts is going to go over what they offer the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3172.623s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And what I find very interesting is they're doing Method and Somerville at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3177.186s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So we can see what they're offering Somerville a little bit and what we are getting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3182.049s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And so my goal was to go to that meeting and just, I live in Tufts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3188.51s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: neighborhood right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3189.671s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I live at the feet of Tufts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3192.414s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'm always up on campus, and I'm always interested in how they're giving back to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3197.458s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I also am a parent of a Jumbo, and you get a great education there, and they are good to our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3205.325s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So they do do some positive things, but we just need to make sure that we're getting what we need from them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3214.326s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: A couple people spoke on that, so I thought they might be of interest for them to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3218.467s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you for the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3540.156s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Motion to approve the request of $2,700 to send Rosalie forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4037.798s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just wanted to make one comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4041.258s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto, then Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4042.719s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Krutz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4043.119s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: First of all, I think Mr. Tucci's placement over at the McGlen is an excellent<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4052.605s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: choice right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4053.766s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know parents came forward at our last meeting with concerns of spreading Mr. DeLava too thin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4059.03s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I appreciate the administration making a thoughtful and really appropriate choice to send him down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4067.456s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I wanted to say thank you very much for really thinking about good choices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4073.22s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I appreciate the high school making arrangements and filling in so that way he could step in this position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4081.236s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I know it's a growth potential for Mr. Tucci as well, and a well-deserved one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4086.721s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I've observed him over the years as a committee member, and I've seen him grow in his career.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4091.905s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I think that he's a great professional from what I've observed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4096.209s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I'm really happy that he took this step for himself and for the McGlenn community as a whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4103.855s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I wanted to start by saying thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4107.644s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: and if you can convey that to others who I'm sure had a role in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4113.107s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Also, I wanted to say I did attend the open house at the McGlen, and I was extremely excited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4119.751s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: My children both went through the McGlen, and I saw all the projects, and there was a landscape of people's yards, and one of them had a pool, and that's the one I liked the most because I really want a pool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4130.977s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I got outvoted by my family, so we don't have one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4133.838s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't think we have enough square footage either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4137.847s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So it was really fun to walk the halls and see the people and see the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4142.311s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And yourself and Dr. Riccadeli did an excellent job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4147.635s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I look forward to seeing tomorrow nights because I'm going to try very hard to be there as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4153.359s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Um, I do think that it was pretty full and I would have loved to seen it like filled to the capacity, but it is a big auditorium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4161.525s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So, you know, we'll see what tomorrow night brings and um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4165.445s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Your presentation maybe could be posted online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4168.247s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't know if anybody recorded it, but it's worthy of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4171.89s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It was very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4172.871s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You went through everything that parents could have for questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4176.293s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I liked you bringing someone down who graduated from McGlen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4180.557s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think it was Sebastian.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4183.979s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm sorry, I can't talk tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4185.26s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm very tired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4186.021s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Sebastian Tringali did a wonderful job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4187.882s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And he spoke beautifully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4189.343s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And so did the parents of current teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4192.326s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They were very impactful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4194.462s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And the whole flow of the evening was very well done, and you represented our district very well to the parents moving on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4203.144s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I think parents left there like, this is a great place to bring my children, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4235.595s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I just had one final question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4238.697s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't want to ruin all the love fest, but we need to speak about graduation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4243.259s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And usually Mr. Belson speaks at graduation, but since he's retiring April 30th,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4249.152s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm just asking, would that be you, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4251.212s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Nelson?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4254.553s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Oh, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4255.473s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I didn't know if it... That's why I was just bringing it up for something to think about for future because it was mentioned earlier and just brought it to my mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4264.095s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So just something for the committee to put in their mind as a thought and maybe we should speak about it soon because graduation is coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4275.277s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4276.117s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you for your time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4624.177s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4624.997s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4625.677s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: How many children, uh, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4635.096s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Um, and Mr. Delaver mentioned that the Andrews, um, students received financial<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4646.512s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: opportunities to attend if they didn't have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4648.733s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Does the McGlynn have a fund that's big enough to make sure every student with financial need that wants to go can go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4727.145s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just want to make sure that every student, no matter of their income or their parent's situation, has an opportunity to not miss out on all of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4737.633s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Not only the educational piece, but the social piece as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4741.416s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that's very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4742.817s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I'm very glad that you were able to meet that need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4745.839s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: If that changes, just<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4748.203s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The mayor already said, you can ask her for money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4750.364s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5568.866s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5569.826s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5571.627s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'd like to pass it this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5572.987s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: A lot of my questions have been asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5575.208s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5862.922s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Do we have any data on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5865.043s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Since we started giving all students PSATs, how many more students are taking the SATs because they had that first opportunity?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5890.914s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5891.654s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think it's a great opportunity because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5895.398s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: that we're offering to all children now to take those PSATs so they're less frightened of taking the SAT and it builds their confidence and they always do better when they have that practice time and I know some other districts have done that for years and I'm very pleased that we're offering that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5918.506s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think your budget, it looks great and the idea of using your<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5925.775s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: What you received last year in a different way is good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5929.076s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I do see the increase for the AP studies and any opportunity that our children has to, because we complete globally now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5937.4s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We don't just complete with people from Massachusetts or our neighboring districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5943.522s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Kids that are going up at Tufts, they're from all over the world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5946.723s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And if our kids are going to get there, they have to take those higher end classes, and they have to pass some of those exams.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5953.543s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'm more than happy to approve this motion for later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5961.528s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: OK, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1444.104s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1445.185s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1446.246s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Could you tell me what the percentage of the forms returned are for each building?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1450.609s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Do you know that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1451.269s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So the free and reduced eligibility?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1453.011s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, whether they sign that they need it or they return the form saying that they're not eligible but they have to sign their form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1460.516s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Does every student sign have a form returned?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1464.839s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1465.6s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And how do we get, like, two parents that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1471.348s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: don't know what this is and it's coming home and they're not knowing to turn them back in and get the quote we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1478.61s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because that would change a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1481.631s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And do parents know that this also reflects in whether or not they pay for SAT exams as well as college applications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1489.593s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Their free and reduced lunch has bigger implications other than just foods on a daily basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1495.175s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I don't think, like up at the high school, you might not get any kids with learning forms, but if they knew that that was tied in and there was like a campaign to really educate people throughout the community, I think that our numbers could actually be higher than what they're listed here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1511.182s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1512.142s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that that's concerning to me and I think we have to have like almost a hundred percent return rate for building and like really make it like a campaign or part of re-registration at each year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1523.366s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that way we we are making sure we capture hungry families as well as giving all those alternative<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1531.547s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: processes, so I would really like to know how many forms were returned per school, like broken down by school, as well as a plan for outreach for next year, so that way we are reaching every family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1545.497s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They either sign off yes or they sign off no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1549.1s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know it's a big job and a big undertaking, but I think it's well worth it in the community because I don't think people<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1555.35s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: especially non-English families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1558.534s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1559.856s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Knowing that there are other things that this qualifies them for is so important to make sure they get food.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1624.147s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And my point, too, is sometimes there's awards for 100% return rate for classes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1629.75s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They get really getting the word out and being a campaign so that the word goes home and people are excited and learning about it because they don't pay attention to every form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1638.974s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And it's so important to feed our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1641.235s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And it's so important for kids that say, oh, we don't have money for our college applications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1647.378s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm not applying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1649.431s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: you know, the tests are covered and the applications are cheaper, and like, it's so many, many more aspects of this, as well as our district could receive more federal funding because of our percentage rates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1664.952s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's just a suggestion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1666.232s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think I made it maybe last year as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1718.675s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1719.335s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Motion to have that report presented to the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1723.157s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1724.058s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1724.338s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Vandevoort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1865.257s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Um, I, I saw on, um, some social media that, um, the Columbus School was talking about maybe sour milk at some of the things and asked that, that, that they just look into that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1876.16s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I saw on some social media about it at the McGlen and, and definitely at the Columbus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1880.921s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I saw some, uh, posts about children not taking the milk because they felt the milk was sour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2737.137s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I heard that students are doing it in classrooms because it looks like just a USB.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2743.525s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And they also can even exhale right into their hoodies, and you don't even see anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2749.552s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So kids in class are actually, they call it dueling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4394.746s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Are we using the tobacco policy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4415.023s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Well, with the growth I see throughout not just our community, but socially, in adults as well as<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4422.726s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: high school age students, I would like for this committee to start working on that so that way it's in our handbooks as vaping, as juuling, as the correct terminology so students are very clear how we as adults feel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4437.623s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: in this community about this, because students just do not believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4442.767s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They think that, oh, I quit smoking, I'm only vaping now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4446.09s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And that's what you hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4447.731s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And they don't realize when it gets in their lungs, it's like popcorn and it blows up their lungs and it does all these health implications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4454.417s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And there's not a lot of data because they haven't been doing it for years, but having<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4460.256s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Two people at my house who read this report before I got here, almost 27 and almost 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4466.063s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: One's a future NP and one works in another community on these exact programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4473.751s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They were happy to see our numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4476.474s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: that we're doing a great job in MedFed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4479.097s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We want to be clear, call it what it is, name it, say it's not okay, and tell them that from day one so that way the wording is correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4488.045s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because once you name something, it's not like this secret thing anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4493.77s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that's a motion on the floor, and I need a second from one of my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4498.892s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'd like to see this in place and in every handbook at our junior high and high school level by next year so that parents know that this is happening in our community and that we're taking it seriously and we're not going to continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4761.918s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4763.52s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So when you're doing that training this year for CPI or First Aid, can we add a back-end training?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4770.005s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's already in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4770.886s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's already there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4772.787s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And is that for both the high school and the vocational school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4775.509s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes, it is seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4777.011s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4778.031s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think that's wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4779.553s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I think that's wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6156.949s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Can I ask a point of clarification?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6159.491s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6161.673s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So you said the key point cameras.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6164.076s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Does that mean all cameras are now online and working or just key point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6209.313s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Two weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6210.294s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And then all cameras within the district will be up and running and functioning appropriately?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6273.704s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Just as another follow-up, I know that Attorney Bill O'Keefe offered to supply us with extra cameras, and even if we have them as a stash of backup cameras, he's more than willing to donate them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6287.951s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: He has in the past, and he has more to donate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6290.292s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'm making a motion now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6293.754s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: that the superintendent reach out to him and just see if they're functioning with our system now and if it's appropriate to have them as backup cameras.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6353.042s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6353.542s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I also make a motion to send him a thank you note.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6358.425s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Consistently over the years providing us with any technology that comes to his gifts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6365.632s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that was the security issue I was I wanted some clarity on the business office team and now that it's fully staffed What types of movement will happen were there any positions added like I'm just curious I know we talked about HR person at one point the superintendent mentioned something like that I just was wondering what what that looks like now, or maybe we could even get like you know a workshop plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6394.812s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, thank you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6430.247s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Can we see that chart anyway, just so the committee members, we have an idea of what the roles are, who's in those roles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6439.012s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, that would be helpful, because if we have any questions moving forward, of course we'd go to the superintendent, but you know, it's just to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6446.496s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Names and job titles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6447.657s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, that would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6449.198s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6473.201s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just also want to speak about the community schools budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6479.202s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I know that the committee approved almost two years ago about having it quarterly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6484.564s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So just as a friendly reminder that I'd like to see that coming forward soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6488.024s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6488.985s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6489.865s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Maybe we can even add it to the list of items on the back of our agenda so we don't forget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6495.066s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because I might forget if it's not written.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6497.286s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6502.13s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You never know, it could happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6504.372s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7790.968s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7792.489s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: First of all, thank you for making all the changes I brought forward at that meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7799.219s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm just hoping that that statement about the method of public schools is committed to ensuring that the district field trips are accessible to all students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7809.745s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The policy adheres to all requirements set forth by both Section 504, Rehabilitation Act and American Disability Act meets the needs that were brought up by other people at that meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7823.313s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think it does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7824.074s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think it's very appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7859.864s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I just wanted to comment that I hope that that does meet that need, and thank you for adding that in, as well as making the changes I brought forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7869.706s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The only other thing I have is I was hoping to see an example of the form that teachers and staff would meet, and I wanted to, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7879.37s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: make sure that it's on the online, so it goes from one person, gets signed off by the nurses, then goes to the administration, and then finally signed off by the superintendent in electronic format.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7891.639s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I would like to see and approve that form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7894.922s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And also an example of the medication administration slash delegation form that the district uses, I'd like to see that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7903.469s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So it's here all in one shot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7905.571s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So if parents ever want to see what's the policy,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7908.613s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They have the sample forms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7910.155s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They have everything right here part of this packet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7913.018s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'm asking that this be revised and brought to us with those intact because that was what was requested at our last meeting for my notes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7922.708s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Can I ask a question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8037.256s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: At least we have a policy in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8039.477s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8039.717s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The forms need to be approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8041.399s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I want them district wide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8042.8s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: There's specific things, so it's hard to approve something based on without having everything at one point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8050.045s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I do like everything is in here that we need in here, but I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8056.688s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: How long would it take to get the forms to us and be presented?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8060.23s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I mean, we have a lot of meetings coming up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8062.291s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I mean, they have to be K-12 forms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8182.382s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto, follow up on this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8183.863s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8185.424s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So the form I'm looking at is the application to go on the field trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8190.508s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Not so much all the forms that all parents have to do, but even the application form, like, OK, I want to take my second grade class to apple picking at, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8204.147s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: small like farms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8206.109s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And so I'm going to go online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8207.891s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm going to fill this out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8209.572s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's going to go to the nurse and it's going to go to my head, you know, my principal and the superintendent for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8217.99s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's the type of form I want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8219.29s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: From the teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8220.271s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: From everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8221.031s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I want it tracked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8222.111s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I want to know, I want data next year saying, this is where they went.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8227.112s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: This grade over here went on five field trips, whereas this school over here hasn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8232.994s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And maybe as a district, we might want to help them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8236.695s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Or I want that data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8238.656s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that's the form that I, I don't need every single form at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8243.117s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But I want, when you roll this out, hey, here's our new thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8246.398s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And this is how you apply.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8248.258s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I wanted to go with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8249.899s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's the form that starts the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8313.441s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: This is just for teachers to fill out an application to take the class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9029.209s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9030.27s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9031.35s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Could you tell me what the percentage of the forms returned are for each building?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9035.693s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Do you know that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9036.373s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So the free and reduced eligibility?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9038.094s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, whether they sign that they need it or they return the form saying that they're not eligible but they have to sign their form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9045.619s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Does every student sign have a form returned?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9049.922s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9050.622s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And how do we get like two parents that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9056.416s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: don't know what this is and it's coming home and they're not knowing to turn them back in and get the quote we need because that would change a lot and do parents know that this also reflects in whether or not they pay for SAT exams as well as college applications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9074.661s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Their free and reduced lunch has bigger implications other than just foods on a daily basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9080.243s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I don't think, like up at the high school, you might not get any forms, but if they knew that that was tied in and there was like a campaign to really educate people throughout the community, I think that our numbers could actually be higher than what they're listed here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9096.318s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9097.279s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that that's concerning to me and I think we have to have like almost 100% return rate for building and like really make it like a campaign or part of re-registration at each year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9108.504s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that way we we are making sure we capture hungry families as well as giving all those alternative<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9116.687s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: processes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9117.588s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I would really like to know how many forms were returned per school, like broken down by school, as well as a plan for outreach for next year, so that way we are reaching every family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9130.601s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They either sign off yes or they sign off no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9134.185s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know it's a big job and a big undertaking, but I think it's well worth it in the community because I don't think people<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9140.503s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: especially non-English families knowing that there are other things that this qualifies them for and it's so important to make sure that they get food.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9209.252s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And my point, too, is sometimes there's awards for 100% return rate for classes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9214.854s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They get really getting the word out and being a campaign so that the word goes home and people are excited and learning about it because they don't pay attention to every form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9224.057s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And it's so important to feed our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9226.318s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And it's so important for kids that say, oh, we don't have money for our college applications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9232.48s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm not applying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9234.537s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: you know, the tests are covered and the applications are cheaper and like it's so many, many more aspects of this, as well as our district could receive more federal funding because of our percentage rates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9250.051s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's just a suggestion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9251.331s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think I made it maybe last year as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9304.438s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Motion to have that report presented to the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9308.249s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you, Miss Vanderpool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9445.67s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mayor Burke, we'll report on student survey before our nutritionist leaves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9450.994s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I saw on some social media that the Columbus School was talking about maybe sour milk at some of the things and asked that they just look into that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9461.26s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I saw on some social media at the McGlen and definitely at the Columbus, I saw some posts about children not taking the milk because they felt the milk was sour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=10322.274s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I heard that students are doing it in classrooms because it looks like just a USB and they also like can even exhale right into the hoodies and you don't even see anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=10334.691s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So kids in class are actually, they call it drooling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11978.29s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Do we have a vaping policy on the books or are we using the tobacco policy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12000.245s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Well with the growth I see throughout not just our community but socially and adults as well as high school age students I would like for this committee to start working on that so that way it's in our handbooks as vaping<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12016.036s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: as jeweling, as the correct terminology, so students are very clear how we as adults feel in this community about this, because students just do not believe, they think that, oh, I quit smoking, I'm only vaping now, and that's what you hear, and they don't realize when it gets in their lungs, it's like popcorn, and it blows up their lungs, and it does all these health implications, and there's not a lot of data because they haven't been doing it for years, but having,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12045.478s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Two people in my house who read this report before I got here, almost 27 and almost 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12051.242s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: One's a future NP and one works in another community on these exact programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12058.968s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They were happy to see our numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12061.73s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: that we're doing a great job in MedFed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12064.352s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We want to be clear, call it what it is, name it, say it's not okay, and tell them that from day one, so that way the wording is correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12073.298s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because once you name something, it's not like this secret thing anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12077.241s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's not as fun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12079.022s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that's a motion on on the floor and I need a second second my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12084.143s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'd like to see this in place and in every handbook at every at our junior high and high school level by next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12091.504s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that parents know that this is happening in our community and that we're taking it seriously and we're not going to we're not going to continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12347.186s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12348.806s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So when you're doing that training this year for CPI or first aid, can we add back in training that's already in it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12358.069s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And is that for both the high school and the vocational seniors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12361.829s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So so that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12363.31s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think that's wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12364.81s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I think Mr. Turgali.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13742.267s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Can I ask a point of clarification?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13744.83s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13747.012s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So you said the key point cameras.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13749.395s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Does that mean all cameras are now online and working or just key point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13794.636s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Two weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13795.617s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And then all cameras within the district will be up and running and functioning appropriately?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13859.027s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Just as another follow-up, I know that Attorney Bill O'Keefe offered to supply us with extra cameras, and even if we have them as a stash of backup cameras, he's more than willing to donate them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13873.271s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: He has in the past, and he has more to donate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13875.612s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'm making a motion now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13879.054s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: that the superintendent reach out to him and just see if they're functioning with our system now and if it's appropriate to have them as backup cameras.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13938.396s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13938.897s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I also make a motion to send him a thank you note.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13943.744s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Consistently over the years providing us with any technology that comes to his hands.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13951.028s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that was the security issue I was I wanted some clarity on the business office team and now that it's fully staffed What types of movement will happen were there any positions added like I'm just curious I know we talked about HR person at one point the superintendent mentioned something like that I just was wondering what what that looks like now or maybe we could even get like, you know, a workshop plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13980.128s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13980.388s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14015.605s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Can we see that chart anyway, just so, as committee members, we have an idea of what the roles are, who's in, like, who's in those roles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14024.369s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, that would be helpful, because if we have any questions moving forward, of course we'd go to the superintendent, but, you know, it's just to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14031.833s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Names and job titles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14032.994s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, that would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14034.555s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14058.563s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just also want to speak about the community schools budget, and I know that the committee approved almost two years ago about having it quarterly, so just as a friendly reminder that I'd like to see that coming forward soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14074.357s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14075.238s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Maybe we can even add it to the list of items on the back of our agenda so we don't forget, because I might forget if it's not written.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14082.644s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15376.121s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15377.883s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: First of all, thank you for making all the changes I brought forward at that meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15384.594s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm just hoping that that statement about the method of public schools is committed to ensuring that the district field trips are accessible to all students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15395.102s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The policy adheres to all requirements set forth by both Section 504 Rehabilitation Act and American Disability Act meets the needs that were brought up by other people at that meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15408.713s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think it does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15409.613s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think it's very appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15441.764s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I did research And I just wanted to comment that I hope that Does meet that need and thank you for adding that in as well as making the changes I brought forward The only other thing I have is I was hoping to see an example of the form that teachers and staff would meet And I wanted to you know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15464.753s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: make sure that it's on online so it goes from one person gets signed off by the nurses then goes to the administration and then finally signed off by the superintendent in electronic forum format.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15477.003s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I would like to see and approve that form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15480.286s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And also an example of the medication administration slash delegation form that the district uses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15487.409s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'd like to see that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15488.81s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So it's here all in one shot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15490.931s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So if parents ever want to see what's the policy, they have the sample forms, they have everything right here, part of this packet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15498.394s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'm asking that this be revised and brought to us with those intact, because that was what was requested at our last meeting for my notes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15508.098s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Can I ask a question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15622.66s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: At least we have a policy in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15625.192s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The forms need to be approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15626.793s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I want them district-wide this specific thing So it's hard to approve something based on without having everything at one point I do like everything is in here that we need in here, but I How long would it take to get the forms to us and be presented we have a lot of meetings coming up I mean They have to be k-12<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15767.151s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto, follow up on this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15769.212s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15770.832s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So the form I'm looking at is the application to go on the field trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15775.914s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Not so much all the forms that all parents have to do, but even the application form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15781.736s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, I want to take my second grade class to apple picking at, you know, small farms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15791.543s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And so I'm going to go online, I'm going to fill this out, it's going to go to the nurse, and it's going to go to my head, you know, my principal and the superintendent for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15803.416s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's the type of form I want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15804.697s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: From the teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15805.677s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: From everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15806.458s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I want it tracked, so I want to know, I want data next year saying, this is where they went.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15812.941s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: This grade over here went on five field trips, whereas this school over here hasn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15818.424s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And maybe as a district, we might want to help them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15822.126s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: or, you know, I want that data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15824.527s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that's the form that I, I don't need every single form at this point, but I want, when you roll this out, okay, here's our new thing, and this is how you apply.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15833.668s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I want it to go with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15835.309s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: If you just do that one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15835.949s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So the form that starts the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15899.214s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: This is just for teachers to fill out an application to take the class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=63.969s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I had a question on... So, we were talking about...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=77.699s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: additional students that come from new developments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=84.383s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And we requested our report be given to us in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=88.385s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just want more detail about what was requested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=92.207s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think I said I would like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=95.189s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: units of a hundred and above instead of the hundred and fifty and we would like to try to capture non school-aged children as well as school-aged children so we can pre-plan in our budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=106.938s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I would like that noted in the minutes as well as on the back of our requested reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=158.544s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Kirsten Kirsten's not here, but I Okay, so my first question is in tuition reimbursement features I saw a lot of line items for that and I just didn't know what the policy was for tuition reimbursement because just in this bill Approval we have seven thousand six hundred and eighty four dollars in tuition reimbursement for teachers I don't know how teachers apply for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=184.784s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't know how it's allocated<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=210.244s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And could you just explain how teachers apply for that and how they've been notified that they have that option?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=232.21s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And now that you say that, I do remember approving that piece of the budget, and I'm glad to see it started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=269.532s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=270.653s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I have a few more items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=272.633s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: My second item is on page 3 of 16.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=274.614s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's for $3,395 and it says Medford High School miscellaneous charges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=282.277s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Does anybody have a recollection as to what and the payment was the vendor was method high school So I was just curious what that was this is for the hockey clothing, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=295.065s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Hockey uniforms<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=298.453s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, and the next item is number three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=303.358s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: An athletic official on page 11 of 16, an athletic official bill was paid $10,220.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=309.724s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That just seems so much higher than most of the other ones, and it just caught my eye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=336.693s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, I was just curious, because it said an individual for that large amount of money, just seemed worth bringing up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=342.757s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And number four is on page 12 of 16.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=346.92s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It says net sports group $8,998, and it says the reason is unclassified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=356.067s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I was just wondering why that wasn't classified, and exactly what that was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=363.212s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's on page... Page 12.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=382.398s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Good thing to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=385.179s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you for clarifying those questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=393.201s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=537.855s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I requested to have separate rankings in quarterly meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=541.858s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's not exactly what I had motioned for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=544.86s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: What I had motioned for is a separate internal ranking, so that way we know which students in the vocational school and their class rank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=554.645s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I believe that's how I remember it correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=557.087s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I also asked that a notation be presented on the transcript.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=562.19s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And if that's not possible,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=564.091s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: then I strongly agree with my colleague that the heads of both schools as well as the guidance department needs to come to us and tell us that our motion isn't possible and to present us with what options are possible and how we're going to move forward with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=580.95s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: because this is a very important issue for our seniors and our juniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=584.533s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: At least with our sophomores, we have time to notify them of this change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=588.698s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's still gonna be hard for that level, but at some point, we need to merge them in with the high school rankings, because we do have one code now, and that's how we report it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=598.807s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: but we need to make some adjustment for these two years, I believe, and that's why I made the motion, and that's why it was approved unanimously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=607.369s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'm agreeing with my colleague's motion, and I hope that happens very quickly, because this is affecting students that are already sent out applications to colleges, so I motion that it be done immediately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=697.006s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Could we warrant, would this warrant an emergency meeting because of the timeliness with children's transcripts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=705.068s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So as a school committee member, I'm making a motion that if they can't rectify this by the end of this week that we have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=711.57s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: meeting at the beginning of next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=714.115s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I need someone to second that motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=716.058s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'll second it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1717.365s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1718.326s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I didn't hear that the teachers were upset until I saw the large group outside tonight,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1725.003s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: actually happy to see a lot of you because I haven't seen you in a few years because both my children graduated from the McGlynn Elementary and Middle School and then Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1734.666s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So it was really nice to see you all and see you still dedicated and acting in such a group way, such a team building way to represent yourselves in such a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1748.166s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: A difficult thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1749.066s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm very sorry to hear that you felt slighted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1753.668s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: When my children were going into middle school, it was hoping that they would get into the McLean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1761.29s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So, when I hear the difference now with the Andrews, you know, it's like we all say, it goes up and down at different sides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1769.392s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: To hear that you're educating 60% of the high needs students in our district in middle school, that's a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1777.596s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: 60% of your students in your school being high needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1781.737s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's a tremendous job that you're doing every day and you're representing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1785.519s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: in servicing children with very, very significant needs, and you're doing it really well, because if you weren't, I would have known that, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1795.587s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I would have known that and heard that, and that we would have had an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1799.871s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We never hear of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1801.212s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The only thing we do hear is our friends are going to a different school, and you know, the emotional impact that has on people's children, and that breaks my heart,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1812.762s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: the social emotional well-being of a child is so important to their education that we need to listen to how that's affecting people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1821.669s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And all our intention was last week is to find ways to make the McGlynn, their marketing, their PR, to let people know about the wonderful things and the wonderful teachers that you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1836.587s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: so that parents are aware of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1838.588s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It wasn't to say, well, the Andrews is better, how are we gonna make the McGlenn better?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1843.932s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We know you're better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1845.473s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We never even thought for a second that you weren't better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1849.496s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's just maybe you need a little bit more PR.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1852.998s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Maybe your clubs need to be published a little bit more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1856.7s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Maybe we need to have the paper there to celebrate some of your things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1861.824s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: In other ways, that's how I looked at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1864.318s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Or, if you did need more money for clubs, I did that, I believe, last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1872.485s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't know why I don't have that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1874.846s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Maybe we need to do that, and look at those type of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1878.289s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But it was never, never that you were dedicated and wonderful, because that has never come to any of our attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1887.389s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I am so grateful that you were comfortable enough to go forward and speak for yourselves in this manner, that you thought that we had that impression.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1895.212s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And that's far from what I thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1897.774s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So, I am grateful to see you all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1900.055s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I hope you understand that we are here to help in any way that we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1904.977s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And if you have ideas, we want you to bring them forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1908.058s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You're in the front line and you know better than anyone else in this room what you're doing every day and what needs to be celebrated and what needs to be sent out to the parents and the community as a whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1920.723s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So your input is most valuable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1924.945s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I'm always willing to hear that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1927.267s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I'm willing to make other people hear it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1930.008s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because I have a big mouth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1932.61s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So welcome and thank you for coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1935.191s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I'm sorry that if it was an impression that wasn't pleasant for you all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1942.065s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2446.36s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2447.36s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mayor Burke, I'd like to make a motion that the administration meet with the teachers of the McGlynn to go over some of these concerns and come up with an action plan together and present the new action plan to the school committee in one month's time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2464.389s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I need someone to second that motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2466.15s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2469.151s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Well, yes, but at the very least, a meeting with them to work on a new action plan that needs to be presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2477.354s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2801.772s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: First of all, I'd like to clarify, 60% of high need students is not special education students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2807.156s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Those are students, when they take state level exams, they fall into different classifications, either ELL or different subgroups in that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2817.443s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So there's a lot of different combinations that could be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2820.725s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I just didn't realize that it was at 60% capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2824.628s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I knew our needs levels were different, and I knew that they housed the ELL program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2830.052s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that would raise the number, but I just didn't know that it was at that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2834.015s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So just so everybody in the community knows, there's not 60% of the students at the McGlenn Middle School that are special education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2842.36s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They just fall into either financial need, or ELL need, or different types of subcategories that are tested on standardized testing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2852.366s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The second part about PR is yes, we are all responsible for PR.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2858.367s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And as a school committee member, I myself feel that way too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2861.528s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: In any way I can help and do that, I am more than willing to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2865.109s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And just to let the community know all the positives of both our middle schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2870.991s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And as far as going out and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2873.186s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: participating in the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2874.987s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I was actually at the exercise group at the elementary school at the McGlynn last week trying to do hula hoop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2882.131s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It didn't work out very well in my favor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2884.573s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But I am trying to like pop into different things throughout the community and just see what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2890.896s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So like renew my own knowledge of each school too because my children have graduated and moved on and it's good to go back and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2901.277s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I went to parent night up at the high school as a freshman parent would and sat in the audience and just heard what questions were being done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2910.14s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I know myself that my colleagues attend a lot of different things and a lot of them have school age children and are in the buildings at all times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2918.502s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And for me I have to make more of an effort to do that because my children have graduated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2924.384s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So as far as that goes, that's the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2929.685s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: By requesting a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2932.679s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: to have their input for a new improvement plan or updated plan, not really improvement plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2941.101s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: A plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2941.661s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Just a plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2943.382s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: An action plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2944.802s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Sorry, it went out of my mind for a moment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2948.563s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: My motion was to have a meeting on that because I want the teachers at the table and I want to be at the table as well and I want the superintendent to be there because we all need to be heard, not just us up here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2961.502s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: and you were heard tonight, I hope you feel heard, in a different way, but with concrete items to talk about would be good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2972.832s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And we might come up with the same or similar action plan in the end that's already been before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2982.597s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's just that you might feel like you were heard and part of the process better, which is just always great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2988.199s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'm hoping, and I agree with you that that needs to happen more and more often from this membership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2996.923s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So thank you for bringing those concerns forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3829.692s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3830.233s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3831.153s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thanks, I had some questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3832.715s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, so once you train everybody and they become a mentor, what do they do with that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3837.84s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And how do other children know that they're<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3865.239s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, so is this for all clubs, or just like sports clubs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3870.881s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: No, all clubs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3871.901s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, so and then the students in those clubs know that certain students in the club are trained mentors, so if they have an issue, they go to them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3891.571s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3893.193s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I was just wondering how that all works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3894.995s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So if two children have an issue, they know that there's a mentor in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3910.353s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Great, thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3911.174s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's why I was just wondering how it actually happened that people knew about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3915.559s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3916.22s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3916.82s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3918.102s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3918.402s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3918.502s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Stone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3973.594s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4107.467s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4108.688s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4109.508s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4110.689s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So could any of these funds be helpful with us since the whole community uses the school parks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4117.472s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: like if we need to redo all the rubber in the school yard, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4123.66s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So we can put that request in right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4126.424s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We can start at each school each year and just keep rotating throughout.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4133.172s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: forever?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4187.741s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I meant the schoolyards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4188.903s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The schoolyards, where the play structures are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4192.126s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes, that is definitely included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4194.108s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They are used all the time, evenings and weekends by the community and it would be really nice if we were first on the list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4500.277s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4500.537s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4503.078s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: How do you decide?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4505.019s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Do you decide that as a committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4507.526s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: based on all the input you've received throughout?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4988.623s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I have the t-shirt in the car and all the other things that I go out to take home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4997.438s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: from many, many people there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4999.579s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I also wanted to comment that Hallmark Health took my blood pressure, and the machine wasn't working well, so the vocational technical high school took it, and they were right on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5012.207s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Was it good?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5012.627s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, mine too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5013.048s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You're healthy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5013.708s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5014.008s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5018.911s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It was actually low that evening, because I kept missing you in the crowd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5022.133s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Let's keep it that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5203.691s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5205.532s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5206.613s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Getting back to the report at hand, so through this report, it looked like you might have been leading up to maybe staff changes and more people to run the school brains.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5222.862s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's how I read it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5224.023s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And so I had some questions like who already did our state reporting in the past and are they the point person for school brains at this point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5233.575s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Is this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5236.066s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Once they're up and trained isn't this going to streamline things so that way there'll be less people once the data is entered initially and it's correct and updated by parents through the porthole and portal not porthole portal and Sorry, it's been a long day<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5255.649s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Once that initial work is done and then people are trained in it, isn't it going to be much more efficient and accurate and we won't need additional staff because we'll have a good beginning?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5370.108s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm gonna request that when we do meet and discuss that we have like a layout of the administrative and the staffing yeah like who reports to who what job they do what what their position is what their salary is like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5387.097s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: like all of that data and information on like a graph so we see that and that way we can see the needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5393.861s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And it also helps tighten up what they're responsible for and who they directly report to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5398.944s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So when you do bring that to our attention, that's what I hope it looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5403.727s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'll leave it at that at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5405.588s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think there's been a lot of motions for you tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5409.21s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm not gonna make any motions, but just an idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6100.23s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6101.03s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6101.911s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6102.551s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Do we have any data on non-athletic concussions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6105.752s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: An example is today at my school, at 745, we had an eighth grader trip and fall and fall into the wall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6114.655s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And he was out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6116.679s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So, I called the, you know, the nurse wasn't available, so I had to call 911.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6122.886s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So, I mean, that was a non-athletic concussion, possible concussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6138.459s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because we want to make sure that even our clumsy students, no, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6164.793s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Right, especially because those students also go back into classrooms as well and have to be cleared in that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6170.315s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And the whole process has to be the same for those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6173.256s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So maybe that might be something we need to keep data on in the future, so when it's presented we have all students' data, not just athletic students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6182.979s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6186.14s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=114.426s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: additional students that come from new developments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=121.108s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And we requested our report be given to us in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=125.089s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just want more detail about what was requested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=128.91s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think I said I would like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=131.911s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: units of a hundred and above instead of the hundred and fifty and we would like to try to capture non school-aged children as well as school-aged children so we can pre-plan in our budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=143.616s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I would like that noted in the minutes as well as on the back of our requested reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=190.911s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I have a few questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=192.192s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Certainly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=192.592s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't know if Kirsten's here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=195.232s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Kirsten?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=196.133s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, Kirsten.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=199.593s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, so my first question is in tuition reimbursement features, I saw a lot of line items for that, and I just didn't know what the policy was for tuition reimbursement because just in this bill,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=213.826s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Approval we have seven thousand six hundred and eighty four dollars in tuition reimbursement for teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=219.537s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't know how teachers apply for that I don't know how it's allocated<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=246.99s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And could you just explain how teachers apply for that and how they've been notified that they have that option?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=268.956s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And now that you say that, I do remember approving that piece of the budget, and I'm glad to see it started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=306.277s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=307.403s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I have a few more items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=309.384s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: My second item is on page three of 16.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=311.744s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's for $3,395 and it says Medford High School miscellaneous charges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=319.006s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Does anybody have a recollection as to what, and the payment was, the vendor was Medford High School, so I was just curious what that was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=328.769s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=331.81s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Hockey uniforms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=335.194s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, and the next item is number three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=340.097s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: An athletic official on page 11 of 16, an athletic official bill was paid $10,220.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=346.461s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That just seems so much higher than most of the other ones, and it just caught my eye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=373.379s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, I was just curious, because it said an individual for that large amount of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=376.901s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It just seemed worth bringing up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=379.462s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And number four is on page 12 of 16.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=383.624s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It says net sports group $8,998, and it says the reason is unclassified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=392.768s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I was just wondering why that wasn't classified, and exactly what that was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=399.872s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's on page... Page 12.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=419.136s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Good thing to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=421.917s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you for clarifying those questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=429.919s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=574.596s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I requested to have separate rankings in quarterly meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=578.579s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's not exactly what I had motioned for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=581.602s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: What I had motioned for is a separate internal ranking, so that way we know which students in the vocational school and their class rank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=591.369s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I believe that's how I remember it correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=593.831s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I also asked that a notation be presented on the transcript.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=598.915s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And if that's not possible,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=600.836s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: then I strongly agree with my colleague that the heads of both schools as well as the guidance department needs to come to us and tell us that our motion isn't possible and to present us with what options are possible and how we're gonna move forward with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=617.639s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: because this is a very important issue for our seniors and our juniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=621.243s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: At least with our sophomores, we have time to notify them of this change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=625.387s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's still gonna be hard for that level, but at some point, we need to merge them in with the high school rankings, because we do have one code now, and that's how we report it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=635.516s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: but we need to make some adjustment for these two years, I believe, and that's why I made the motion, and that's why it was approved unanimously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=644.063s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'm agreeing with my colleague's motion, and I hope that happens very quickly, because this is affecting students that are already sent out applications to colleges, so I motion that it be done immediately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=733.724s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Could we warrant, would this warrant an emergency meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=737.687s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because of the timeliness with children's transcripts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=741.789s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So as a school committee member, I'm making a motion that if they can't rectify this by the end of this week, that we have a meeting at the beginning of next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=750.834s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I need someone to second that motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=752.795s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'll second it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=753.535s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: There's a second by Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1754.157s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1755.137s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I didn't hear that the teachers were upset until I saw the large group outside tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1761.815s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: actually happy to see a lot of you because I haven't seen you in a few years because both my children graduated from the McGlynn Elementary and Middle School and then Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1771.481s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So it was really nice to see you all and see you still dedicated and acting in such a group way, such a team building way to represent yourselves in such<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1784.972s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: A difficult thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1785.873s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm very sorry to hear that you felt slighted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1790.476s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: When my children were going into middle school, it was hoping that they would get into the McLean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1798.081s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So, when I hear the difference now with the Andrews, you know, it's like we all say, it goes up and down at different sides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1806.195s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: To hear that you're educating 60% of the high needs students in our district in middle school, that's a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1814.382s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: 60% of your students in your school being high needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1818.525s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's a tremendous job that you're doing every day and you're representing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1822.308s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: in servicing children with very, very significant needs, and you're doing it really well, because if you weren't, I would have known that, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1832.394s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I would have known that and heard that, and that we would have had an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1836.657s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We never hear of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1837.997s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The only thing we do hear is our friends are going to a different school, and the emotional impact that has on people's children, and that breaks my heart,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1849.537s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The social, emotional well-being of a child is so important to their education that we need to listen to how that's affecting people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1858.439s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And all our intention was last week is to find ways to make the McGlynn, you know, their marketing, their PR, to let people know about the wonderful things and the wonderful teachers that you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1873.362s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: so that parents are aware of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1875.363s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It wasn't to say, well, the Andrews better, how are we gonna make the McGlenn better?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1880.707s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We know you're better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1882.248s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We never even thought for a second that you weren't better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1886.271s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's just maybe you need a little bit more PR.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1889.753s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Maybe your clubs need to be published a little bit more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1893.455s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Maybe we need to have the paper there to celebrate some of your things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1898.579s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: In other ways, that's how I looked at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1901.093s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Or if you did need more money for clubs, I did that, I believe, last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1909.58s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Why not have that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1911.621s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Maybe we need to do that and look at those type of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1915.044s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But it was never, never that more dedicated amount of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1919.747s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That is never.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1923.005s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I am so grateful that you were comfortable enough to go forward and speak for yourselves in this manner that you thought that we had that impression.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1931.969s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And that's far from what I thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1934.531s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So, I am grateful to see you all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1936.832s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I hope you understand that we are here to help in any way that we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1941.754s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And if you have ideas, we want you to bring them forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1944.835s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You're in the front line and you know better than anyone else in this room what you're doing every day and what needs to be celebrated and what needs to be sent out to the parents and the community as a whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1957.487s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So your input is most valuable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1961.711s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I'm always willing to hear that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1964.033s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I'm willing to make other people hear it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1966.775s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because I have a big mouth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1969.137s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So welcome and thank you for coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1971.959s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I'm sorry that if it was an impression that wasn't pleasant for you all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1978.823s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2483.183s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2484.203s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mayor Burke, I'd like to make a motion that the administration meet with the teachers of the McGlen to go over some of these concerns and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2493.1s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: come up with an action plan together and present the new action plan to the school committee in one month's time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2501.225s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I need someone to second that motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2505.948s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Well, yes, but at the very least.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2508.669s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: A meeting with them to work on a new action plan that needs to be presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2833.591s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2835.112s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2835.972s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you Mayberg and thank you Mr. McCullough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2838.615s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: First of all, I'd like to clarify, 60% of high need students is not special education students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2843.996s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Those are students, when they take state level exams, they fall into different classifications, either ELL or different subgroups in that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2854.298s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So there's a lot of different combinations that could be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2857.579s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I just didn't realize that it was at 60% capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2861.46s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I knew our needs levels were different, and I knew that they housed the ELL program,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2866.901s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that would raise the number, but I just didn't know that it was at that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2870.885s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So just so everybody in the community knows, there's not 60% of the students at the McGlenn Middle School that are special education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2879.212s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They just fall into either financial need, or ELL need, or different types of subcategories that are tested on standardized testing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2889.212s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The second part about PR is, yes, we are all responsible for PR.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2895.195s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And as a school committee member, I myself feel that way too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2898.356s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: In any way I can help and do that, I am more than willing to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2901.958s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And just to let the community know all the positives of both our middle schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2907.82s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And as far as going out and participating in the schools,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2911.832s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I was actually at the exercise group at the elementary school at the McGlynn last week trying to do hula hoop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2918.976s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It didn't work out very well in my favor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2921.417s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But I am trying to pop into different things throughout the community and just see what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2927.72s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So renew my own knowledge of each school too because my children have graduated and moved on and it's good to go back and I went to parent night at the high school as a freshman parent would.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2941.946s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: and sat in the audience and just heard what questions were being done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2947.168s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I know myself that my colleagues attend a lot of different things, and a lot of them have school-age children and are in the buildings at all times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2955.351s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And for me, I have to make more of an effort to do that because my children have graduated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2961.213s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So as far as that goes, that's the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2965.575s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And by requesting a meeting,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2969.505s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: to have their input for a new improvement plan or updated plan, not really improvement plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2977.949s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: A plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2978.489s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Just an action plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2980.27s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: An action plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2981.63s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Sorry, it went out of my mind for a moment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2985.432s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: My motion was to have a meeting on that because I want the teachers at the table and I want to be at the table as well and I want the superintendent to be there because we all need to be heard, not just us up here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2998.357s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: and you were heard tonight, I hope you feel heard, in a different way, but with concrete items to talk about would be good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3009.684s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And we might come out with the same or similar action plan in the end that's already been before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3019.477s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's just that you might feel like you were heard and part of the process better, which is just always great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3025.058s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'm hoping, and that's our goal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3039.341s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I agree with you that that needs to happen more and more often from this membership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3046.622s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So thank you for bringing those concerns forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3160.626s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Most impressive person on the internet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3866.543s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3867.084s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3868.004s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thanks, I had some questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3869.545s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, so once you train everybody and they become a mentor, what do they do with that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3874.667s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And how do other children know that they're<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3902.085s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, so is this for all clubs, or just like sports clubs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3908.747s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, so and then the students in those clubs know that certain students in the club are trained mentors, so if they have an issue, they go to them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3928.414s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: and thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3930.036s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I was just wondering how that all works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3931.838s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So like if two children have an issue, they know that there's a mentor in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3947.717s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Then if a student if someone comes looking for help from the student who does the student then go to does that be a pretty heavy topic for a teenager<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4144.442s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4145.603s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4146.424s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4147.605s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So could any of these funds be helpful with us since the whole community uses the school parks like if we need to redo all the rubber and the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4158.436s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: the school year, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4160.577s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So we can put that request in right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4163.298s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We can start at each school each year and just keep rotating throughout forever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4224.659s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I meant the school yards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4225.8s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The school, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4226.66s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The school yards where the play structures are to make them safer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4229.522s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes, that is definitely included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4230.763s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They are used all the time, evenings and weekends by the community and it would be really nice if<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4237.527s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just really wanted to congratulate you on working so hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4537.161s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4537.381s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4538.462s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4539.983s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: How do you decide?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4541.905s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Do you decide that as a committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4544.383s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: based on all the input you've received throughout?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5025.511s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The hat, shirts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5026.531s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I have the t-shirt in the car and all the other things that I go out to take home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5034.363s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: from many, many people there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5036.525s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I also wanted to comment that Hallmark Health took my blood pressure and the machine wasn't working well, so the vocational technical high school took it and they were right on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5049.156s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Is that people at tonight's meeting or afternoon?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5055.821s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It was actually low that evening because I kept missing you in the crowd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5059.224s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Let's keep it that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5240.596s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5243.559s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Getting back to the report at hand, so through this report, it looked like you might have been leading up to maybe staff changes and more people to run the school brains.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5259.806s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's how I read it and so I had some questions like who already did our state reporting in the past and are they the point person for school brains at this point is this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5273.011s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Once they're up and trained isn't this going to streamline things?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5276.013s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So there'll be less people once the data is ended initially and it's correct and updated by parents through the porthole and portal not porthole portal and Sorry, it's been a long day<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5292.598s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Once that initial work is done and then people are trained in it, isn't it going to be much more efficient and accurate and we won't need additional staff because we'll have a good beginning?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5406.44s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5407.841s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm gonna request that when we do meet and discuss that, we have like a layout of the administrative and the staffing, like who reports to who, what job they do, what their position is, what their salary is, like all of that data and information on like a graph so we see that and that way we can see the needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5430.794s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And it also helps tighten up what they're responsible for and who they directly report to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5435.857s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So, when you do bring that to our attention, that's what I hope it looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5440.639s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm going to leave it at that at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5442.48s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think there's been a lot of motions for you tonight, so I'm not going to make any motions, but just an idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6137.193s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6137.973s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6138.853s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6139.513s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Do we have any data on non-athletic concussions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6142.694s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: An example is today at my school, at 745, we had an eighth grader trip and fall and fall into the wall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6151.597s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And he was out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6153.642s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So, I called the, you know, the nurse wasn't available, so I had to call 911.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6159.829s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So, I mean, that was a non-athletic concussion, possible concussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6175.421s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because we want to make sure that even our clumsy students, no, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6201.735s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Right, especially because those students also go back into classrooms as well and have to be cleaned in that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6207.278s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6207.898s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And the whole process has to be the same for those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6210.22s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So maybe that might be something we need to keep data on in the future so when it's presented we have all students' data, not just athletic students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6219.925s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6223.086s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>
