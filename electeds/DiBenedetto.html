    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=63.969s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I had a question on... So, we were talking about...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=77.699s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: additional students that come from new developments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=84.383s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And we requested our report be given to us in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=88.385s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just want more detail about what was requested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=92.207s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think I said I would like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=95.189s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: units of a hundred and above instead of the hundred and fifty and we would like to try to capture non school-aged children as well as school-aged children so we can pre-plan in our budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=106.938s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I would like that noted in the minutes as well as on the back of our requested reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=158.544s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Kirsten Kirsten's not here, but I Okay, so my first question is in tuition reimbursement features I saw a lot of line items for that and I just didn't know what the policy was for tuition reimbursement because just in this bill Approval we have seven thousand six hundred and eighty four dollars in tuition reimbursement for teachers I don't know how teachers apply for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=184.784s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't know how it's allocated<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=210.244s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And could you just explain how teachers apply for that and how they've been notified that they have that option?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=232.21s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And now that you say that, I do remember approving that piece of the budget, and I'm glad to see it started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=269.532s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=270.653s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I have a few more items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=272.633s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: My second item is on page 3 of 16.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=274.614s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's for $3,395 and it says Meffitt High School miscellaneous charges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=282.277s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Does anybody have a recollection as to what and the payment was the vendor was method high school So I was just curious what that was this is for the hockey clothing, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=295.065s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Hockey uniforms<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=298.453s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, and the next item is number three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=303.358s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: An athletic official on page 11 of 16, an athletic official bill was paid $10,220.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=309.724s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That just seems so much higher than most of the other ones, and it just caught my eye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=336.693s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, I was just curious, because it said an individual for that large amount of money, just seemed worth bringing up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=342.757s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And number four is on page 12 of 16.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=346.92s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It says net sports group $8,998, and it says the reason is unclassified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=356.067s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I was just wondering why that wasn't classified, and exactly what that was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=363.212s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's on page... Page 12.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=382.398s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Good thing to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=385.179s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you for clarifying those questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=393.201s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=537.855s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I requested to have separate rankings in quarterly meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=541.858s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's not exactly what I had motioned for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=544.86s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: What I had motioned for is a separate internal ranking, so that way we know which students in the vocational school and their class rank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=554.645s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I believe that's how I remember it correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=557.087s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I also asked that a notation be presented on the transcript.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=562.19s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And if that's not possible,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=564.091s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: then I strongly agree with my colleague that the heads of both schools as well as the guidance department needs to come to us and tell us that our motion isn't possible and to present us with what options are possible and how we're going to move forward with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=580.95s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: because this is a very important issue for our seniors and our juniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=584.533s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: At least with our sophomores, we have time to notify them of this change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=588.698s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's still gonna be hard for that level, but at some point, we need to merge them in with the high school rankings, because we do have one code now, and that's how we report it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=598.807s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: but we need to make some adjustment for these two years, I believe, and that's why I made the motion, and that's why it was approved unanimously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=607.369s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'm agreeing with my colleague's motion, and I hope that happens very quickly, because this is affecting students that are already sent out applications to colleges, so I motion that it be done immediately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=697.006s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Could we warrant, would this warrant an emergency meeting because of the timeliness with children's transcripts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=705.068s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So as a school committee member, I'm making a motion that if they can't rectify this by the end of this week that we have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=711.57s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: meeting at the beginning of next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=714.115s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I need someone to second that motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=716.058s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'll second it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1717.365s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1718.326s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I didn't hear that the teachers were upset until I saw the large group outside tonight,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1725.003s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: actually happy to see a lot of you because I haven't seen you in a few years because both my children graduated from the McGlynn Elementary and Middle School and then Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1734.666s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So it was really nice to see you all and see you still dedicated and acting in such a group way, such a team building way to represent yourselves in such a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1748.166s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: A difficult thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1749.066s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm very sorry to hear that you felt slighted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1753.668s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: When my children were going into middle school, it was hoping that they would get into the McLean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1761.29s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So, when I hear the difference now with the Andrews, you know, it's like we all say, it goes up and down at different sides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1769.392s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: To hear that you're educating 60% of the high needs students in our district in middle school, that's a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1777.596s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: 60% of your students in your school being high needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1781.737s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's a tremendous job that you're doing every day and you're representing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1785.519s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: in servicing children with very, very significant needs, and you're doing it really well, because if you weren't, I would have known that, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1795.587s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I would have known that and heard that, and that we would have had an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1799.871s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We never hear of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1801.212s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The only thing we do hear is our friends are going to a different school, and you know, the emotional impact that has on people's children, and that breaks my heart,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1812.762s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: the social emotional well-being of a child is so important to their education that we need to listen to how that's affecting people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1821.669s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And all our intention was last week is to find ways to make the McGlynn, their marketing, their PR, to let people know about the wonderful things and the wonderful teachers that you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1836.587s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: so that parents are aware of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1838.588s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It wasn't to say, well, the Andrews is better, how are we gonna make the McGlenn better?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1843.932s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We know you're better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1845.473s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We never even thought for a second that you weren't better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1849.496s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's just maybe you need a little bit more PR.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1852.998s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Maybe your clubs need to be published a little bit more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1856.7s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Maybe we need to have the paper there to celebrate some of your things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1861.824s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: In other ways, that's how I looked at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1864.318s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Or, if you did need more money for clubs, I did that, I believe, last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1872.485s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I don't know why I don't have that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1874.846s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Maybe we need to do that, and look at those type of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1878.289s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But it was never, never that you were dedicated and wonderful, because that has never come to any of our attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1887.389s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I am so grateful that you were comfortable enough to go forward and speak for yourselves in this manner, that you thought that we had that impression.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1895.212s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And that's far from what I thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1897.774s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So, I am grateful to see you all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1900.055s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I hope you understand that we are here to help in any way that we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1904.977s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And if you have ideas, we want you to bring them forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1908.058s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You're in the front line and you know better than anyone else in this room what you're doing every day and what needs to be celebrated and what needs to be sent out to the parents and the community as a whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1920.723s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So your input is most valuable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1924.945s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I'm always willing to hear that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1927.267s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I'm willing to make other people hear it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1930.008s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because I have a big mouth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1932.61s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So welcome and thank you for coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1935.191s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I'm sorry that if it was an impression that wasn't pleasant for you all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1942.065s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2446.36s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2447.36s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mayor Burke, I'd like to make a motion that the administration meet with the teachers of the McGlynn to go over some of these concerns and come up with an action plan together and present the new action plan to the school committee in one month's time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2464.389s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I need someone to second that motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2466.15s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2469.151s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Well, yes, but at the very least, a meeting with them to work on a new action plan that needs to be presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2477.354s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2801.772s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: First of all, I'd like to clarify, 60% of high need students is not special education students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2807.156s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Those are students, when they take state level exams, they fall into different classifications, either ELL or different subgroups in that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2817.443s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So there's a lot of different combinations that could be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2820.725s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I just didn't realize that it was at 60% capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2824.628s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I knew our needs levels were different, and I knew that they housed the ELL program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2830.052s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that would raise the number, but I just didn't know that it was at that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2834.015s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So just so everybody in the community knows, there's not 60% of the students at the McGlenn Middle School that are special education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2842.36s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They just fall into either financial need, or ELL need, or different types of subcategories that are tested on standardized testing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2852.366s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The second part about PR is yes, we are all responsible for PR.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2858.367s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And as a school committee member, I myself feel that way too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2861.528s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: In any way I can help and do that, I am more than willing to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2865.109s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And just to let the community know all the positives of both our middle schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2870.991s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And as far as going out and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2873.186s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: participating in the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2874.987s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I was actually at the exercise group at the elementary school at the McGlynn last week trying to do hula hoop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2882.131s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It didn't work out very well in my favor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2884.573s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But I am trying to like pop into different things throughout the community and just see what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2890.896s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So like renew my own knowledge of each school too because my children have graduated and moved on and it's good to go back and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2901.277s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I went to parent night up at the high school as a freshman parent would and sat in the audience and just heard what questions were being done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2910.14s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I know myself that my colleagues attend a lot of different things and a lot of them have school age children and are in the buildings at all times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2918.502s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And for me I have to make more of an effort to do that because my children have graduated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2924.384s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So as far as that goes, that's the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2929.685s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: By requesting a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2932.679s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: to have their input for a new improvement plan or updated plan, not really improvement plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2941.101s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: A plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2941.661s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Just a plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2943.382s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: An action plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2944.802s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Sorry, it went out of my mind for a moment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2948.563s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: My motion was to have a meeting on that because I want the teachers at the table and I want to be at the table as well and I want the superintendent to be there because we all need to be heard, not just us up here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2961.502s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: and you were heard tonight, I hope you feel heard, in a different way, but with concrete items to talk about would be good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2972.832s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And we might come up with the same or similar action plan in the end that's already been before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2982.597s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's just that you might feel like you were heard and part of the process better, which is just always great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2988.199s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'm hoping, and I agree with you that that needs to happen more and more often from this membership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2996.923s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So thank you for bringing those concerns forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3829.692s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3830.233s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3831.153s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thanks, I had some questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3832.715s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, so once you train everybody and they become a mentor, what do they do with that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3837.84s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And how do other children know that they're<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3865.239s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, so is this for all clubs, or just like sports clubs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3870.881s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: No, all clubs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3871.901s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, so and then the students in those clubs know that certain students in the club are trained mentors, so if they have an issue, they go to them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3891.571s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3893.193s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I was just wondering how that all works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3894.995s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So if two children have an issue, they know that there's a mentor in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3910.353s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Great, thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3911.174s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's why I was just wondering how it actually happened that people knew about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3915.559s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3916.22s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3916.82s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3918.102s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3918.402s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3918.502s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Stone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3973.594s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4107.467s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4108.688s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4109.508s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4110.689s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So could any of these funds be helpful with us since the whole community uses the school parks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4117.472s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: like if we need to redo all the rubber in the school yard, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4123.66s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So we can put that request in right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4126.424s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We can start at each school each year and just keep rotating throughout.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4133.172s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: forever?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4187.741s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I meant the schoolyards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4188.903s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The schoolyards, where the play structures are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4192.126s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes, that is definitely included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4194.108s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They are used all the time, evenings and weekends by the community and it would be really nice if we were first on the list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4500.277s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4500.537s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4503.078s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: How do you decide?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4505.019s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Do you decide that as a committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4507.526s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: based on all the input you've received throughout?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4988.623s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I have the t-shirt in the car and all the other things that I go out to take home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4997.438s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: from many, many people there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4999.579s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I also wanted to comment that Hallmark Health took my blood pressure, and the machine wasn't working well, so the vocational technical high school took it, and they were right on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5012.207s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Was it good?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5012.627s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, mine too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5013.048s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You're healthy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5013.708s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5014.008s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5018.911s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It was actually low that evening, because I kept missing you in the crowd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5022.133s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Let's keep it that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5203.691s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5205.532s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5206.613s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Getting back to the report at hand, so through this report, it looked like you might have been leading up to maybe staff changes and more people to run the school brains.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5222.862s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's how I read it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5224.023s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And so I had some questions like who already did our state reporting in the past and are they the point person for school brains at this point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5233.575s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Is this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5236.066s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Once they're up and trained isn't this going to streamline things so that way there'll be less people once the data is entered initially and it's correct and updated by parents through the porthole and portal not porthole portal and Sorry, it's been a long day<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5255.649s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Once that initial work is done and then people are trained in it, isn't it going to be much more efficient and accurate and we won't need additional staff because we'll have a good beginning?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5370.108s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm gonna request that when we do meet and discuss that we have like a layout of the administrative and the staffing yeah like who reports to who what job they do what what their position is what their salary is like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5387.097s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: like all of that data and information on like a graph so we see that and that way we can see the needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5393.861s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And it also helps tighten up what they're responsible for and who they directly report to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5398.944s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So when you do bring that to our attention, that's what I hope it looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5403.727s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'll leave it at that at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5405.588s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think there's been a lot of motions for you tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5409.21s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm not gonna make any motions, but just an idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6100.23s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6101.03s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6101.911s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6102.551s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Do we have any data on non-athletic concussions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6105.752s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: An example is today at my school, at 745, we had an eighth grader trip and fall and fall into the wall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6114.655s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And he was out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6116.679s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So, I called the, you know, the nurse wasn't available, so I had to call 911.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6122.886s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So, I mean, that was a non-athletic concussion, possible concussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6138.459s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because we want to make sure that even our clumsy students, no, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6164.793s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Right, especially because those students also go back into classrooms as well and have to be cleared in that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6170.315s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And the whole process has to be the same for those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6173.256s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So maybe that might be something we need to keep data on in the future, so when it's presented we have all students' data, not just athletic students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6182.979s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6186.14s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9029.209s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr Benedetto?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9030.27s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9031.35s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Could you tell me what the percentage of the forms returned are for each building?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9035.693s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Do you know that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9036.373s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So the free and reduced eligibility?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9038.094s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, whether they sign that they need it or they return the form saying that they're not eligible but they have to sign their form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9045.619s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Does every student sign have a form returned?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9049.922s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9050.622s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And how do we get like two parents that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9056.416s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: don't know what this is and it's coming home and they're not knowing to turn them back in and get the quote we need because that would change a lot and do parents know that this also reflects in whether or not they pay for SAT exams as well as college applications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9074.661s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Their free and reduced lunch has bigger implications other than just foods on a daily basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9080.243s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I don't think, like up at the high school, you might not get any forms, but if they knew that that was tied in and there was like a campaign to really educate people throughout the community, I think that our numbers could actually be higher than what they're listed here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9096.318s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9097.279s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that that's concerning to me and I think we have to have like almost 100% return rate for building and like really make it like a campaign or part of re-registration at each year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9108.504s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that way we we are making sure we capture hungry families as well as giving all those alternative<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9116.687s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: processes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9117.588s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I would really like to know how many forms were returned per school, like broken down by school, as well as a plan for outreach for next year, so that way we are reaching every family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9130.601s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They either sign off yes or they sign off no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9134.185s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know it's a big job and a big undertaking, but I think it's well worth it in the community because I don't think people<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9140.503s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: especially non-English families knowing that there are other things that this qualifies them for and it's so important to make sure that they get food.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9209.252s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And my point, too, is sometimes there's awards for 100% return rate for classes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9214.854s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They get really getting the word out and being a campaign so that the word goes home and people are excited and learning about it because they don't pay attention to every form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9224.057s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And it's so important to feed our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9226.318s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And it's so important for kids that say, oh, we don't have money for our college applications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9232.48s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm not applying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9234.537s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: you know, the tests are covered and the applications are cheaper and like it's so many, many more aspects of this, as well as our district could receive more federal funding because of our percentage rates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9250.051s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's just a suggestion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9251.331s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think I made it maybe last year as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9304.438s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Motion to have that report presented to the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9308.249s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you, Miss Vanderpool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9445.67s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mayor Burke, we'll report on student survey before our nutritionist leaves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9450.994s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I saw on some social media that the Columbus School was talking about maybe sour milk at some of the things and asked that they just look into that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9461.26s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I saw on some social media at the McGlen and definitely at the Columbus, I saw some posts about children not taking the milk because they felt the milk was sour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=10322.274s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I heard that students are doing it in classrooms because it looks like just a USB and they also like can even exhale right into the hoodies and you don't even see anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=10334.691s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So kids in class are actually, they call it drooling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11978.29s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Do we have a vaping policy on the books or are we using the tobacco policy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12000.245s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Well with the growth I see throughout not just our community but socially and adults as well as high school age students I would like for this committee to start working on that so that way it's in our handbooks as vaping<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12016.036s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: as jeweling, as the correct terminology, so students are very clear how we as adults feel in this community about this, because students just do not believe, they think that, oh, I quit smoking, I'm only vaping now, and that's what you hear, and they don't realize when it gets in their lungs, it's like popcorn, and it blows up their lungs, and it does all these health implications, and there's not a lot of data because they haven't been doing it for years, but having,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12045.478s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Two people in my house who read this report before I got here, almost 27 and almost 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12051.242s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: One's a future NP and one works in another community on these exact programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12058.968s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They were happy to see our numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12061.73s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: that we're doing a great job in MedFed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12064.352s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We want to be clear, call it what it is, name it, say it's not okay, and tell them that from day one, so that way the wording is correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12073.298s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because once you name something, it's not like this secret thing anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12077.241s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's not as fun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12079.022s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that's a motion on on the floor and I need a second second my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12084.143s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'd like to see this in place and in every handbook at every at our junior high and high school level by next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12091.504s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that parents know that this is happening in our community and that we're taking it seriously and we're not going to we're not going to continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12347.186s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12348.806s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So when you're doing that training this year for CPI or first aid, can we add back in training that's already in it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12358.069s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And is that for both the high school and the vocational seniors?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12361.829s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So so that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12363.31s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think that's wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12364.81s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I think Mr. Turgali.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13742.267s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Can I ask a point of clarification?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13744.83s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13747.012s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So you said the key point cameras.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13749.395s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Does that mean all cameras are now online and working or just key point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13794.636s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Two weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13795.617s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And then all cameras within the district will be up and running and functioning appropriately?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13859.027s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Just as another follow-up, I know that Attorney Bill O'Keefe offered to supply us with extra cameras, and even if we have them as a stash of backup cameras, he's more than willing to donate them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13873.271s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: He has in the past, and he has more to donate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13875.612s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'm making a motion now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13879.054s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: that the superintendent reach out to him and just see if they're functioning with our system now and if it's appropriate to have them as backup cameras.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13938.396s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13938.897s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I also make a motion to send him a thank you note.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13943.744s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Consistently over the years providing us with any technology that comes to his hands.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13951.028s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that was the security issue I was I wanted some clarity on the business office team and now that it's fully staffed What types of movement will happen were there any positions added like I'm just curious I know we talked about HR person at one point the superintendent mentioned something like that I just was wondering what what that looks like now or maybe we could even get like, you know, a workshop plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13980.128s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13980.388s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14015.605s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Can we see that chart anyway, just so, as committee members, we have an idea of what the roles are, who's in, like, who's in those roles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14024.369s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, that would be helpful, because if we have any questions moving forward, of course we'd go to the superintendent, but, you know, it's just to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14031.833s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Names and job titles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14032.994s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, that would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14034.555s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14058.563s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just also want to speak about the community schools budget, and I know that the committee approved almost two years ago about having it quarterly, so just as a friendly reminder that I'd like to see that coming forward soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14074.357s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14075.238s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Maybe we can even add it to the list of items on the back of our agenda so we don't forget, because I might forget if it's not written.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14082.644s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15376.121s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15377.883s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: First of all, thank you for making all the changes I brought forward at that meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15384.594s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm just hoping that that statement about the method of public schools is committed to ensuring that the district field trips are accessible to all students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15395.102s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The policy adheres to all requirements set forth by both Section 504 Rehabilitation Act and American Disability Act meets the needs that were brought up by other people at that meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15408.713s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think it does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15409.613s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think it's very appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15441.764s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I did research And I just wanted to comment that I hope that Does meet that need and thank you for adding that in as well as making the changes I brought forward The only other thing I have is I was hoping to see an example of the form that teachers and staff would meet And I wanted to you know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15464.753s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: make sure that it's on online so it goes from one person gets signed off by the nurses then goes to the administration and then finally signed off by the superintendent in electronic forum format.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15477.003s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I would like to see and approve that form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15480.286s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And also an example of the medication administration slash delegation form that the district uses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15487.409s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'd like to see that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15488.81s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So it's here all in one shot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15490.931s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So if parents ever want to see what's the policy, they have the sample forms, they have everything right here, part of this packet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15498.394s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'm asking that this be revised and brought to us with those intact, because that was what was requested at our last meeting for my notes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15508.098s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Can I ask a question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15622.66s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: At least we have a policy in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15625.192s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The forms need to be approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15626.793s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I want them district-wide this specific thing So it's hard to approve something based on without having everything at one point I do like everything is in here that we need in here, but I How long would it take to get the forms to us and be presented we have a lot of meetings coming up I mean They have to be k-12<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15767.151s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto, follow up on this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15769.212s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15770.832s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So the form I'm looking at is the application to go on the field trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15775.914s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Not so much all the forms that all parents have to do, but even the application form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15781.736s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Okay, I want to take my second grade class to apple picking at, you know, small farms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15791.543s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And so I'm going to go online, I'm going to fill this out, it's going to go to the nurse, and it's going to go to my head, you know, my principal and the superintendent for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15803.416s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's the type of form I want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15804.697s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: From the teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15805.677s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: From everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15806.458s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I want it tracked, so I want to know, I want data next year saying, this is where they went.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15812.941s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: This grade over here went on five field trips, whereas this school over here hasn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15818.424s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And maybe as a district, we might want to help them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15822.126s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: or, you know, I want that data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15824.527s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that's the form that I, I don't need every single form at this point, but I want, when you roll this out, okay, here's our new thing, and this is how you apply.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15833.668s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I want it to go with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15835.309s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: If you just do that one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15835.949s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So the form that starts the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15899.214s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: This is just for teachers to fill out an application to take the class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1444.104s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1445.185s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1446.246s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Could you tell me what the percentage of the forms returned are for each building?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1450.609s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Do you know that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1451.269s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So the free and reduced eligibility?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1453.011s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, whether they sign that they need it or they return the form saying that they're not eligible but they have to sign their form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1460.516s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Does every student sign have a form returned?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1464.839s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1465.6s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And how do we get, like, two parents that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1471.348s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: don't know what this is and it's coming home and they're not knowing to turn them back in and get the quote we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1478.61s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because that would change a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1481.631s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And do parents know that this also reflects in whether or not they pay for SAT exams as well as college applications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1489.593s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Their free and reduced lunch has bigger implications other than just foods on a daily basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1495.175s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I don't think, like up at the high school, you might not get any kids with learning forms, but if they knew that that was tied in and there was like a campaign to really educate people throughout the community, I think that our numbers could actually be higher than what they're listed here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1511.182s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1512.142s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that that's concerning to me and I think we have to have like almost a hundred percent return rate for building and like really make it like a campaign or part of re-registration at each year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1523.366s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that way we we are making sure we capture hungry families as well as giving all those alternative<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1531.547s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: processes, so I would really like to know how many forms were returned per school, like broken down by school, as well as a plan for outreach for next year, so that way we are reaching every family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1545.497s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They either sign off yes or they sign off no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1549.1s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I know it's a big job and a big undertaking, but I think it's well worth it in the community because I don't think people<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1555.35s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: especially non-English families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1558.534s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1559.856s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Knowing that there are other things that this qualifies them for is so important to make sure they get food.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1624.147s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And my point, too, is sometimes there's awards for 100% return rate for classes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1629.75s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They get really getting the word out and being a campaign so that the word goes home and people are excited and learning about it because they don't pay attention to every form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1638.974s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And it's so important to feed our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1641.235s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And it's so important for kids that say, oh, we don't have money for our college applications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1647.378s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm not applying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1649.431s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: you know, the tests are covered and the applications are cheaper, and like, it's so many, many more aspects of this, as well as our district could receive more federal funding because of our percentage rates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1664.952s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's just a suggestion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1666.232s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think I made it maybe last year as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1718.675s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1719.335s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Motion to have that report presented to the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1723.157s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1724.058s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1724.338s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Vandevoort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1865.257s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Um, I, I saw on, um, some social media that, um, the Columbus School was talking about maybe sour milk at some of the things and asked that, that, that they just look into that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1876.16s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I saw on some social media about it at the McGlen and, and definitely at the Columbus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1880.921s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I saw some, uh, posts about children not taking the milk because they felt the milk was sour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2737.137s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I heard that students are doing it in classrooms because it looks like just a USB.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2743.525s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And they also can even exhale right into their hoodies, and you don't even see anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2749.552s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So kids in class are actually, they call it dueling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4394.746s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Are we using the tobacco policy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4415.023s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Well, with the growth I see throughout not just our community, but socially, in adults as well as<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4422.726s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: high school age students, I would like for this committee to start working on that so that way it's in our handbooks as vaping, as juuling, as the correct terminology so students are very clear how we as adults feel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4437.623s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: in this community about this, because students just do not believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4442.767s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They think that, oh, I quit smoking, I'm only vaping now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4446.09s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And that's what you hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4447.731s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And they don't realize when it gets in their lungs, it's like popcorn and it blows up their lungs and it does all these health implications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4454.417s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And there's not a lot of data because they haven't been doing it for years, but having<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4460.256s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Two people at my house who read this report before I got here, almost 27 and almost 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4466.063s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: One's a future NP and one works in another community on these exact programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4473.751s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They were happy to see our numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4476.474s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: that we're doing a great job in MedFed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4479.097s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We want to be clear, call it what it is, name it, say it's not okay, and tell them that from day one so that way the wording is correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4488.045s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because once you name something, it's not like this secret thing anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4493.77s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that's a motion on the floor, and I need a second from one of my colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4498.892s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'd like to see this in place and in every handbook at our junior high and high school level by next year so that parents know that this is happening in our community and that we're taking it seriously and we're not going to continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4761.918s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4763.52s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So when you're doing that training this year for CPI or First Aid, can we add a back-end training?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4770.005s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's already in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4770.886s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's already there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4772.787s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And is that for both the high school and the vocational school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4775.509s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes, it is seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4777.011s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4778.031s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think that's wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4779.553s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I think that's wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6156.949s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Can I ask a point of clarification?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6159.491s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6161.673s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So you said the key point cameras.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6164.076s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Does that mean all cameras are now online and working or just key point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6209.313s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Two weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6210.294s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And then all cameras within the district will be up and running and functioning appropriately?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6273.704s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Just as another follow-up, I know that Attorney Bill O'Keefe offered to supply us with extra cameras, and even if we have them as a stash of backup cameras, he's more than willing to donate them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6287.951s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: He has in the past, and he has more to donate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6290.292s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'm making a motion now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6293.754s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: that the superintendent reach out to him and just see if they're functioning with our system now and if it's appropriate to have them as backup cameras.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6353.042s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6353.542s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I also make a motion to send him a thank you note.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6358.425s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Consistently over the years providing us with any technology that comes to his gifts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6365.632s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that was the security issue I was I wanted some clarity on the business office team and now that it's fully staffed What types of movement will happen were there any positions added like I'm just curious I know we talked about HR person at one point the superintendent mentioned something like that I just was wondering what what that looks like now, or maybe we could even get like you know a workshop plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6394.812s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, thank you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6430.247s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Can we see that chart anyway, just so the committee members, we have an idea of what the roles are, who's in those roles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6439.012s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, that would be helpful, because if we have any questions moving forward, of course we'd go to the superintendent, but you know, it's just to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6446.496s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Names and job titles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6447.657s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah, that would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6449.198s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6473.201s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just also want to speak about the community schools budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6479.202s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I know that the committee approved almost two years ago about having it quarterly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6484.564s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So just as a friendly reminder that I'd like to see that coming forward soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6488.024s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6488.985s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6489.865s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Maybe we can even add it to the list of items on the back of our agenda so we don't forget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6495.066s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Because I might forget if it's not written.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6497.286s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6502.13s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You never know, it could happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6504.372s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7790.968s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7792.489s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: First of all, thank you for making all the changes I brought forward at that meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7799.219s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm just hoping that that statement about the method of public schools is committed to ensuring that the district field trips are accessible to all students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7809.745s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The policy adheres to all requirements set forth by both Section 504, Rehabilitation Act and American Disability Act meets the needs that were brought up by other people at that meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7823.313s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think it does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7824.074s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think it's very appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7859.864s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I just wanted to comment that I hope that that does meet that need, and thank you for adding that in, as well as making the changes I brought forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7869.706s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The only other thing I have is I was hoping to see an example of the form that teachers and staff would meet, and I wanted to, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7879.37s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: make sure that it's on the online, so it goes from one person, gets signed off by the nurses, then goes to the administration, and then finally signed off by the superintendent in electronic format.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7891.639s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I would like to see and approve that form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7894.922s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And also an example of the medication administration slash delegation form that the district uses, I'd like to see that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7903.469s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So it's here all in one shot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7905.571s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So if parents ever want to see what's the policy,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7908.613s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They have the sample forms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7910.155s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: They have everything right here part of this packet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7913.018s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'm asking that this be revised and brought to us with those intact because that was what was requested at our last meeting for my notes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7922.708s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Can I ask a question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8037.256s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: At least we have a policy in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8039.477s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8039.717s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The forms need to be approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8041.399s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I want them district wide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8042.8s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: There's specific things, so it's hard to approve something based on without having everything at one point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8050.045s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I do like everything is in here that we need in here, but I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8056.688s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: How long would it take to get the forms to us and be presented?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8060.23s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I mean, we have a lot of meetings coming up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8062.291s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I mean, they have to be K-12 forms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8182.382s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto, follow up on this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8183.863s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8185.424s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So the form I'm looking at is the application to go on the field trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8190.508s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Not so much all the forms that all parents have to do, but even the application form, like, OK, I want to take my second grade class to apple picking at, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8204.147s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: small like farms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8206.109s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And so I'm going to go online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8207.891s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm going to fill this out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8209.572s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's going to go to the nurse and it's going to go to my head, you know, my principal and the superintendent for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8217.99s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: That's the type of form I want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8219.29s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: From the teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8220.271s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: From everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8221.031s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I want it tracked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8222.111s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I want to know, I want data next year saying, this is where they went.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8227.112s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: This grade over here went on five field trips, whereas this school over here hasn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8232.994s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And maybe as a district, we might want to help them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8236.695s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Or I want that data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8238.656s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So that's the form that I, I don't need every single form at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8243.117s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: But I want, when you roll this out, hey, here's our new thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8246.398s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And this is how you apply.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8248.258s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I wanted to go with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8249.899s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's the form that starts the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8313.441s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: This is just for teachers to fill out an application to take the class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=769.089s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Do we have two questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=770.149s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: We'll go around again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=772.95s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=773.491s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Hi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=774.111s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=779.091s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: What is your plan to increase academic growth at each level of our educational system?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=784.679s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Like, could you list your priority actions for each level, elementary, middle, and high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2153.235s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2155.456s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Hey again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2156.236s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Hello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2157.717s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So could you please elaborate on your experience with collective bargaining and a large scale budget development?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2165.621s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4736.105s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Venditto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4737.025s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4739.586s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So in our district, we have an alternative high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4743.588s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And it's very separate from where we are here at this high school and our vocational high school are very close together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4753.773s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Could you think of a few ways that we could open up our program to the high school and vice versa to have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4762.253s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: make sure that those students feel like they are a true Mustang?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7085.799s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you, Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7087.279s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Can I just follow up with a question on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7090.6s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So, Dr. Parla, could you tell me which parts of the collaboration of the vocational school and the high school have your actual fingerprints on it, just so we have concrete examples of what you did in that process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7157.039s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7158.499s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I'd like to go forward with my question, is what's your plan to increase academic growth at each level of an educational system?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7167.902s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Please list for me some of your priority actions for our elementary, middle, high school, vocational school, and Curtis Tufts School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7352.79s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7353.17s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Follow-up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7358.382s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I did, I did have a follow up on that if that's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7363.046s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So, so I was referring pretty much towards testing scores and what actual programs and how could we, you know, get our academic achievement up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7373.615s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I have become aware that this year there have been more eighth grade applications to outside school districts other than our high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7381.402s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I was wondering if you could give us any information or your viewpoint on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7483.52s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7484.54s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=8458.208s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Just to follow up with the idea that you just brought forward, so with carpentry and math, can you tell me how, I mean, it's a great concept, but how do we execute that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=9813.267s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=9814.668s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So my official second question is, please elaborate on your experience with collective bargaining and large-scale budget development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10505.94s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I know over the recent years you have made some changes to the homework policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10517.049s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Could you go over your beliefs in that and why you've made those changes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=70.819s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=73.722s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1460.588s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1461.348s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Hi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1462.309s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Nice to meet you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1464.511s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1465.611s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: My first question is pretty specific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1469.615s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I'm sure you looked at some of our data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1472.166s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And what is your plan to increase the academic growth at each level of our educational system?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1479.65s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So our elementary, middle, and high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1486.773s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1487.373s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: To increase academic scores or rigor in any way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1491.115s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Like if you saw by looking at our data areas that you felt that needed growth and attention at this point, and what kind of ideas do you have to help us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1499.98s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I saw in your resume that you were able to bring schools up to level one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1505.803s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And just the type of things, based on our data, if you had a chance to look at that, if you had any specific ideas or examples.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2074.994s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you, that's an excellent answer to my question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2079.199s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You know your stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4456.873s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4458.053s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4462.718s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Part of my question was already asked, but could you tell me any experience you might have with collective bargaining?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4556.978s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4558.579s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: My second question is professional development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4562.605s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: just your philosophy on it and how it's implemented where you are, if you have any ideas for our school district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4687.66s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So speaking of vision, do you have a district vision for MedFed, or an idea of what you think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4694.414s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: that you would like to see us, how you would like to see us grow?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7138.097s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7141.186s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7141.686s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Nice to meet you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7144.288s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Could you just elaborate on some of your experience with collective bargaining and large scale budget development?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7406.636s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Great, thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7408.036s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7408.416s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7408.516s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Kritz?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=10589.718s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=10590.959s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=10592.96s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I have a question regarding academic growth for our students here in MedFed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=10598.762s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=10600.143s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So could you tell me what kind of plans you would put in place for each level of our educational system, like our elementary, our middle, and our high school students, based on any of the data that you had a chance to review?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=1642.123s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just have a comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=1649.06s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I just want to comment how I appreciate you ending with the positives of the McGlynn School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=1659.65s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I think there are teachers in the room and in the community who are going to watch this and to end on a positive note, especially with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=1670.88s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: perception that the other school was getting more and more with, I thought, was very supportive of teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=1678.724s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And as a student, I just wanted to pay attention to that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=1684.246s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=1823.744s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Just a point of history, Medgard was one of the first schools in Massachusetts to have full day kindergarten.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=1831.209s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I would love us to offer a pre-K program and really push the state towards university pre-K.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=1837.113s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: I feel like that's the foundation of education and I would love to be on the forefront of that within the Commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=1844.217s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And I do like you thinking outside of the box because we have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=1848.54s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: someone had brought a suggestion to us to make one middle school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=1854.125s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: And that was something that I was interested in at that point, a while ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=1858.148s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Someone had suggested that, we had talked about that as a committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=1863.132s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: The buildings itself would have to be changed because the bathrooms, it was not cost effective, but this is a different way to look at that, and I really,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=1874.341s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: It's very interesting and very intriguing to me as a planer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=1878.025s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: Yes, it would be a long-term plan, but I think it's a great plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=4824.486s">[DiBenedetto]</a>: So I did not bring kids back to the school if the school was not back up and operating.<br><br>
