 <p>[Trish Schiapelli]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6782.226s">Trisha</a> Pelley, 53 Garfield Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6785.307s">So</a> since tonight's meeting idea is honesty, I'm very confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6791.489s">We</a> had so many meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6792.709s">We</a> had a lot of community input. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6795.49s">And</a> then we need to have more community input. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6797.591s">We</a> haven't had any meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6798.851s">Did</a> we have meetings or did we not was my number one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6802.352s">since</a> we are now, I am in favor of the MX1 qualification and zoning for our area because it goes against any of the medical clinics that we fought so hard against. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6814.716s">And</a> let's be very clear, this wasn't because we didn't know that it was a methadone dispensary. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6820.817s">We</a> were very clear with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6822.238s">It</a> was the company that was coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6824.798s">It</a> was Habit Opco, which is actually the company that is responsible <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6830.18s">for</a> mass and cast. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6831.882s">It</a> is the company that is responsible for Springfield, and it is the company that two or three months later, was written up in the New York Times under federal investigation for holding psychologically. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6846.1s">ill</a> patients against their will because they had the right insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6849.322s">So</a> insurance fraud. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6850.922s">Is</a> that the kind of companies we want to bring into Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6855.104s">And</a> not only that, we have five medical dispensaries in the area that meet the needs within a four-mile radius. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6865.689s">We</a> are more than covered from a per capita basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6868.87s">So</a> let's not try to taint it that we are NIMBY, that we just didn't want it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6873.292s">There</a> wasn't a need. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6874.533s">It</a> was the wrong company. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6876.033s">And</a> now we do not trust this council as a result of that to allow blanket medical clinics, because none of us have the time to watch and monitor what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6887.739s">So</a> and finally, any methadone clinic or any medical clinic in that area, we can't even keep the trash properly picked up. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6896.485s">Have</a> you seen the rats in the neighborhood? <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6898.627s">And</a> now you want to add medical waste? <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6900.929s">How</a> do we know we're not going to have urine sample cups running down the street and needles? <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6907.113s">So,</a> you know, let's be real here. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6909.895s">So</a> MX1 is fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6911.936s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6913.197s">We've</a> clarified quite a few things this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/JOz8NJmqO-Y&t=6916.16s">I</a> appreciate it.<h2><a href="../2025-08-28_og30Vvr2J5c/2025-08-28_og30Vvr2J5c.html">Medford City Council Candidate Forum 2025</a></h2>
 <p>[Trish Schiapelli]: <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2961.36s">Good</a> evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2962.04s">I</a> am Trish Ciappelli, an independent candidate and homeowner running for the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2967.244s">I</a> moved here to attend Simmons and completed my MBA in 2001. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2971.607s">I</a> have 20 years of experience as a commercial lender in the banking industry, working with CEOs and CFOs with companies with revenues of $10 million to $60 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2982.054s">I</a> became politically active in Medford when I led the battle to stop a methadone dispensary from coming to my Salem Street neighborhood, just .23 miles from an elementary school. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2992.904s">And</a> then again with the radical rezoning of Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2995.966s">After</a> many protests from us, the residents, the OCD, delistened and rolled back the zoning to what the neighborhood wanted. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3002.892s">Unfortunately,</a> this City Council, under the leadership of Zach Baers and a motion from Matt Leming, denied the citizens what they wanted and reverted back to the original zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3014.303s">We</a> must stop radical rezoning, which is now being proposed across the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3019.468s">Our</a> job on the City Council is to protect our neighborhoods, not exploit them. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3024.913s">Yes,</a> we must upgrade our squares and business districts, but not to the detriment of our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3030.696s">Our</a> city has been left to deteriorate for far too long. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3034.297s">Density</a> is not going to solve that. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3036.779s">The</a> recent fire that took place in Somerville and demolished three homes less than a week ago was caused by all of their zoning changes to accommodate density. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3045.783s">Be</a> warned, this will happen here if we allow the density City Council wants forced on our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3052.526s">I</a> will fight for our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3054.647s">We</a> must request a forensic audit. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3057.21s">We</a> all work hard for our money and it is incumbent for the city to accurately report to the public exactly how, where, why our money is being spent, dollar for dollar. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3069.633s">Yes,</a> we have an audit annually by state-approved firm. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3073.115s">However,</a> we taxpayers deserve better financial reporting. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3077.819s">Once</a> our finances are in order, we can then make a sound decision and plan to fix our roads, fix our sidewalks, and get the lead out of our drinking water. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3087.305s">Medford</a> deserves better. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3089.106s">We</a> need to increase our commercial tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3091.527s">The</a> homeowners can't be the sole source of tax revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3095.188s">We</a> just lost $600,000 in tax revenue on the old Budweiser campus because our mayor allowed it to be sold to the MBTA, the same MBTA that she sits on the board of directors. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3107.492s">I</a> ask you, Madam Mayor, isn't that a conflict of interest, selling out the taxpayers of this city to do a favor for a state agency of which you are a board member? <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3118.59s">I</a> most certainly would find that is to be the case, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3122.872s">And</a> we must support our police and fire departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3125.953s">They</a> are very important to our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3128.254s">After</a> meeting with the President of Firefighters Local 1032, I learned that our fire department is understaffed to meet the needs of our current population and will not meet the needs of the proposed expansions. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3140.738s">Remember,</a> a vote for me is a vote for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3142.899s">I</a> respectfully ask for your vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=3144.78s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-08-12_WX-UWIC6r6A/2025-08-12_WX-UWIC6r6A.html">Medford Happenings w/ Trish Schiapelli</a></h2>
 <p>[Trish Schiapelli]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=68.12s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=68.48s">You</a> may owe me one for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=69.962s">Yes,</a> we appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=71.463s">We</a> really do. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=72.404s">But</a> thank you so much for having me back. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=75.686s">I</a> always enjoy the show, and I'm happy to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=78.208s">We</a> enjoy having you here.
 <p>[Trish Schiapelli]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=92.06s">Well,</a> I originally moved to Massachusetts in 1998 to complete my MBA at Simmons University in their Graduate School of Management. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=104.827s">I</a> graduated in 2001. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=107.388s">I</a> have 20 plus years experience as a commercial lender. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=111.33s">in</a> the banking industry. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=113.511s">I</a> work with CEOs and CFOs of companies with revenues in the size of $10 million to $60 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=120.132s">I</a> help them acquire debt, refinance existing debt, purchase their real estate, whatever they may need. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=127.353s">I</a> also help them with their cash cycles in their business so that they can get paid faster, hang on to their money a little bit longer, and then make their payments in a faster, more secure environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=138.035s">So</a> I am currently a Medford resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=141.376s">And</a> I moved here in 2009. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=143.297s">I</a> lived at Station Landing first for just a little over four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=147.317s">And</a> I really loved that development with the access to the T and just being so close to so many things. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=153.799s">And</a> then in 2013, I actually bought my home. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=159.24s">So</a> I actually enjoy the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=161.721s">It's</a> a Victorian.
 <p>[Trish Schiapelli]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=171.988s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Trish Schiapelli]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=188.509s">Yeah,</a> sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=189.29s">So</a> I am running for city council because, first of all, I live in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=194.397s">And</a> I think it has a tremendous amount of potential and opportunity given its proximity to Boston, Cambridge, and access to the 93. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=203.943s">Unfortunately,</a> I believe it's my opinion that it's being horribly mismanaged. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=208.666s">And</a> that is something that if elected to the city council, I would really want to change and improve <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=217.911s">And</a> as you know, the first debacle I became involved in was the methadone dispensary. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=223.698s">That</a> was my wake up moment if you will. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=227.883s">I</a> have to your point what are my concerns, I have a very long list of concerns to be <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=236.293s">honest.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=237.133s">And</a> the first one is my concern is if we stay on this trajectory and we don't have some drastic changes sooner rather than later, that we may hit a point where there's a point of no return. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=248.579s">And</a> I believe that we are in a current downward spiral and we need to correct that as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=255.983s">It</a> is going to be a heavy lift. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=258.064s">absolutely,</a> given the current circumstances and the six years of the current administration and city council, who in my opinion have really done nothing except raise our taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=268.291s">Of</a> course, they must think we're all blind and that because we can't see that nothing is being done in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=275.956s">With</a> our tax money, our roads and sidewalks and water are still not fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=280.679s">in</a> desperate need of repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=282.881s">However,</a> they have managed to throw the city into a complete chaos with this radical rezoning that they pulled out of thin air and decided to thrust onto the community.
 <p>[Trish Schiapelli]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=311.814s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=312.815s">And</a> I'm going to start at the top with the mayor, which I think is where the buck stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=317.456s">And</a> while she is running unopposed, which I find shocking to say the least, <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=322.344s">If</a> she has any interest in saving her reputation and her legacy as the mayor of Medford, I believe she needs to do three very difficult things immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=333.668s">The</a> first thing is she needs to deny the city council their request for additional funds for the zoning studies. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=341.466s">The</a> second thing is she needs to fire consulting. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=345.29s">They</a> are lacking in experience for the project of this size and the location. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=350.456s">They</a> were not the right decision for the project in the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=353.339s">The</a> largest project they have done is out in a smaller town past 128. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=360.247s">And</a> an example of why I think they really need to be fired and we shouldn't be giving them any more money is at a recent presentation at city council when questioned about some of the streets in the homes that were going to be changed with this zoning, they admitted that they hadn't driven <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=377.31s">by</a> the actual addresses or walked through any of the neighborhoods to really understand the lot size and the types of houses their planning is going to affect with this radical rezoning, but rather they chose to rely on Google Maps. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=391.813s">Seriously?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=393.574s">That's</a> what we're paying for? <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=394.894s">I</a> just was really kind of shocked by that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=400.444s">Then</a> the third thing, the mayor absolutely needs to immediately, because it is so long overdue, I believe, in my opinion, she needs to fire Alicia Hunt immediately today for her pandering to developers. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=413.817s">It's</a> really inconscionable and that's just a period, full stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=418.601s">So</a> once those three things have been done on the city side to really help <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=424.146s">reflect</a> and make some changes that we can all live with. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=428.028s">She</a> has a chance to resume herself with the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=431.17s">And</a> then the next thing that needs to happen is it falls to the actual citizens in the city, the good people that live here, the people that vote, the people that want to help and do their part in saving the city and their respective neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=447.04s">And</a> it is really very simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=449.701s">The</a> voters need to vote out every single Our Revolution city councilor, full stop, period. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=460.045s">And</a> I'm going to repeat that, and they may need to write it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=463.446s">The</a> voters need to vote out every single Our Revolution city councilor if they want to take back their city and have a decent city with neighborhoods that they can live in and enjoy and have a say in. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=476.97s">Full</a> stop, no questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=479.961s">So</a> who do they vote for? <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=482.023s">The</a> voters then need to pick independent candidates who will listen to them and put Medford first, not be all involved in a national agenda and with things that aren't even pertaining to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=495.334s">And</a> you have to be careful because not all of those saying that they're independents are true independents. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=501.039s">A</a> couple are questionable because they really don't want to take a hard line. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=506.327s">And</a> this is an election about a hard line. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=508.67s">You</a> take a position, you pick a hill, you live and die on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=514.058s">And</a> that's what this city needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=516.821s">And</a> so one of my favorite sayings is the definition of crazy is doing the same thing over and expecting different results. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=524.847s">We</a> have been doing the same thing over for six years and expecting different results, and we have not gotten any. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=531.172s">So</a> once there is a turnover, <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=532.933s">Then</a> we can roll up our sleeves and really the hard work can begin and we must review rezoning and decide what gets changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=541.518s">We</a> must demand a forensic audit and demand 21st century standards for how we are reporting our finances. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=549.625s">and</a> how we show the taxpayers of this city exactly where their taxpayer dollars are being spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=556.492s">Right</a> now, accountable and transparent with this administration is really just a word salad. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=562.198s">I</a> looked at our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=563.099s">It</a> consists of three lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=565.401s">It</a> consists of revenue, expenses, deficit or surplus.
 <p>[Trish Schiapelli]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=570.325s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=571.186s">Annual</a> reports are really not much better and don't provide a lot of additional information. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=577.129s">I</a> actually reached out to our CPA audit firm in Woburn and more than once and crickets, of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=587.353s">So,</a> we need to really work together and partner with each department in the city and hold people accountable for the people's tax dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=596.102s">And</a> that isn't as difficult as it sounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=598.925s">We</a> need to understand where surplus and deficits are coming from so that we can stop the gaps. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=604.671s">Otherwise,</a> we just continue to rob Peter to pay Paul. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=609.815s">We</a> need to fix our roads desperately. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=612.736s">We</a> need to fix our sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=614.537s">We</a> need to get the lead out of our water system. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=617.058s">We</a> need to fix our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=620.4s">The</a> scores are abhorrent. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=622.901s">And</a> I think I would like to see an ethics guideline added in there for city councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=627.763s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=628.764s">So</a> I think that's important so that we're all playing by the same rules no matter what position you're in. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=635.271s">That's</a> important to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=636.793s">And</a> finally, the people of Medford need to know that every Tuesday night there will be a city council meeting that is consistency is the key. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=644.901s">They</a> can come home, turn on their TV or log in online and we will be there in chamber <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=650.787s">every</a> Tuesday night to discuss and update them on all of the items that we are in the process of working through. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=657.61s">These</a> marathon meetings until midnight or later, because they only meet every other week because that is what is convenient for them, really isn't working. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=667.353s">The</a> citizens of this city have jobs, they have kids, they have a life to live. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=671.515s">Also,</a> it will get rid of all these side meetings behind closed doors, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=675.576s">If</a> we go to meetings every week, the citizens of this city will have the right to hear the facts and the figures and hear the presentation of the pros and cons between their city council members and better understand the concepts of how it will affect them as we move through the discussion of the facts and the figures and research prior to an item being moved to a vote so that they will feel a little more comfortable <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=700.721s">hopefully</a> with the decisions being made. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=702.702s">Of</a> course we would still always have open comments and they would have the right to ask questions and maybe we could delve through it a little bit better. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=709.845s">But</a> I really feel like they've been kept out of the loop and no one has the time and the wherewithal to go look everything up and read through 16 pages. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=718.529s">That's</a> our job. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=719.55s">Then</a> we're going to boil it down and give it to the citizens of Medford so that they can understand what's going on as is their right.
 <p>[Trish Schiapelli]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=746.435s">Well,</a> so I think that, yes, they were misled, but I think that my position on zoning is that we absolutely must improve our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=756.378s">I</a> think as you drive around, it has the potential to be a beautiful city, but right now it looks tired and dirty. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=761.879s">We</a> have to be thoughtful about any zoning that we do and look at the zoning as a total number and how it's going to be affected with the city with <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=771.762s">our</a> resources such as zoning and sewer and things like that, we already had the DPW leader come in and say, you have to give me a number, you have to give me a number. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=781.847s">So</a> they can't give them a number, they're just adding, throwing people at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=785.409s">At</a> some point we're going to end up like other cities were with brownouts and sewage running down your streets, sewage backup during horrible storms. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=794.673s">So</a> I actually think that the city of Medford is at a crossroads right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=798.136s">We</a> have the luxury to design a thoughtful city where people want to live and one that will drive visitors from contiguous cities to come here and spend dollars and enjoy some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=810.066s">The</a> zoning decisions that we make now will define us as a city going forward for many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=815.59s">And</a> we will either be like Somerville, where so many people say, oh, gosh, I lived there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=820.074s">It</a> used to be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=820.934s">It</a> isn't anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=821.875s">You're</a> jam-packed. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=822.756s">It's</a> miserable. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=824.157s">They</a> don't want to live in Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=825.438s">People</a> are starting to move out of Cambridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=827.558s">Or</a> we choose to be smart and manage growth responsibly, where we can keep green spaces, have homes available for people through every season of their life and what they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=838.643s">And</a> in which case, we would be more like Belmont, Winchester, possibly even Melrose. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=844.285s">I</a> would like to see us take that direction and have smart growth, not just throw in density. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=852.608s">But</a> to even imply, as our revolution city councilor Matt Leming did, that gone are the days of a single family house, <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=864.067s">is</a> really just ludicrous. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=866.208s">I</a> think people will always have a need for a single family home and want to choose that as their option of a place to live. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=874.552s">They</a> suffer from the delusion that all growth is good growth, and as we know in business and finance, that isn't necessarily the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=881.955s">Growth</a> that is too fast actually drives up costs and takes a toll on the existing situation and the existing assets, and you can actually put <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=891.86s">the</a> company, or in this case the city, in a deficit position if not monitored and managed appropriately. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=898.682s">I've</a> seen it happen firsthand. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=901.063s">So</a> interesting legal fact that I've done some research, I've talked to a couple of attorneys in preparing for this, and zoning laws are in place to protect the property owners <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=912.007s">not</a> for the city to use and change as they see fit in a desperate cry for additional tax dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=920.014s">Zoning</a> laws initially were established so that you can buy property and not worry that one day you will wake up to a 10-story building next door to your house or a factory. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=932.927s">In</a> fact, zoning ordinances have a valid legal interest in protecting the character of the neighborhood, not destroying the character of the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=945.597s">And</a> this gets back to the taking of land that we had had a conversation about a while ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=950.781s">When</a> you buy a home, you are entitled to certain rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=954.344s">And</a> that right is that you have a say in the neighborhood that you live in. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=959.269s">And</a> the laws are very clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=961.671s">And</a> there are actually two Supreme Court cases, one in 1926 and one in 1928, that actually involved Cambridge, where a zoning ordinance had depleted the plaintiff's property value, and the Supreme Court overturned it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=977.645s">So</a> I feel if we continue down this road and things get as bad as some projections think that they could be with what they want to do, there is going to be a plethora of lawsuits. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=991.282s">So</a> get ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=992.975s">So</a> Medford is just really just waking up to the truth about what is going on in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=996.877s">And</a> my concern right now is for West Medford because I'm worried that they will now get lulled into a false sense of security with the zoning being delayed to March 2026 only to one day wake up and realize <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1011.223s">exactly</a> the ugly scenario that Salem Street is in and the reality, and that is that our sneaky Our Revolution City Councilor Matt Leming in the dead of the night around 11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1023.85s">after</a> the Community Development Board had agreed to the request of the homeowners and we had a completely different neighborhood negotiated, Councilor Matt Leming reversed the request to the original zoning and all six of Our Revolution Councilors voted for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1040.72s">Again,</a> don't be fooled, West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1044.721s">If</a> reelected, this city council will do the same thing to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1052.463s">Don't</a> let it happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1054.824s">There</a> is another saying I like to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1056.725s">People</a> show you who they are and you better believe them. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1059.905s">And</a> they've shown me on several occasions. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1062.986s">Radical</a> rezoning must stop, period.
 <p>[Trish Schiapelli]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1071.245s">It's</a> the truth.
 <p>[Trish Schiapelli]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1073.046s">And</a> there's so many things that people in the city don't know, and I think unless you live in the Salem Street corridor, you really don't understand what happened to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1080.934s">I</a> think people have to go back. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1081.995s">And</a> how egregious it was.
 <p>[Trish Schiapelli]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1091.969s">And</a> those cases, to this day, have never been overturned.
 <p>[Trish Schiapelli]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1115.123s">So</a> I would focus on making the city more business-friendly. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1118.025s">I</a> hear we're not really that friendly to businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1120.687s">And</a> I would make a target list of companies that our city and residents would like to have in Medford and companies that maybe are not available to the contiguous cities that we have that would then drive visitors to our city to see certain things and then <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1139.048s">increase</a> bottom line we need to increase our commercial tax base. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1142.35s">The</a> homeowners really just can't continue to take the hit for that because our administration doesn't know how to attract or negotiate with certain <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1155.057s">certain</a> entities and I feel like you know the Budweiser campus is a perfect example of something that took place and we should have been working with the owners of that and I feel like some of the leadership could have gone there and said thank you so much for you know <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1171.288s">being</a> here all these years and leasing and I understand Budweiser has had to move out because of their, but what can you do to help us and we understand that it's around price and you could even cut a side deal with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1187.17s">I</a> mean, right now we're losing 600,000, but if you said to them, listen, I understand price is important, but if somebody comes in with a million three and they're a few hundred thousand dollars short, let's go with the lesser and we'll pay you back 200,000 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1201.872s">year</a> for three or four years to make up that difference in that sale price, and we're still $400,000 or $500,000 ahead in tax revenue, versus just giving it to the MBTA and then saying, oh, you know, we're losing, we're at a deficit for $600,000 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1218.376s">And</a> things like that are done all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1219.896s">I</a> know they are.
 <p>[Trish Schiapelli]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1224.457s">Well,</a> yeah, that is definitely something I would have advised one of my clients to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1228.218s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1228.778s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1228.978s">Don't</a> let that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1229.639s">If</a> you really want that building, don't let it go. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1231.379s">Go</a> in and try to negotiate. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1232.62s">What's</a> the worst they're going to say is absolutely not. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1234.621s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1234.921s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1235.281s">So</a> you're back to square one, but at least you try. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1237.082s">At</a> least you can say to the good people of Medford, I tried to save us $400,000 to $600,000 in tax revenue, and here's what I did, and they refused to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1245.985s">Looks</a> a lot better.
 <p>[Trish Schiapelli]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1267.711s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1268.052s">I</a> sat through that whole torture show the other night.
 <p>[Trish Schiapelli]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1271.314s">It</a> was a torture show. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1272.314s">I</a> thought it was laughable and a complete waste of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1275.556s">Four</a> hours of nonsense and four hours of my life that I'll never get back. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1279.139s">And</a> they insist on focusing their attention and prioritizing things that are not local and <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1286.283s">things</a> that are happening thousands of miles away. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1288.886s">And</a> I could see if everything was glorious here in Medford, and our roads were fixed, and our sidewalks were perfect, and the birds were humming, and everything was beautiful, and our parkways were perfectly planted, not with weeds and overgrowth. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1303.181s">But</a> I think they did it for a reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1306.544s">I</a> think there was a strategy behind it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1308.546s">And</a> I think it was a much-needed diversion for them so that people can focus on something other than their inept management of the city and their failure at the rezoning, given what's been transpiring. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1322.297s">And</a> as they've already confirmed, like three and a half hours into the meeting, I believe it was, they said, oh, well, by the way, we already knew from the investment company they had let us know that we really didn't have an exorbitant amount of percentage that is out of our guideline in those companies anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1341.922s">Oh,</a> my God. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1343.062s">Are</a> you kidding me? <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1344.603s">They</a> wasted all that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1346.203s">You</a> could have just changed the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1347.844s">You</a> could have made the announcement and said we wanted to save everyone's time. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1352.865s">But</a> no, they didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1353.925s">And</a> so what I thought was fascinating is that they actually allowed people from other cities, Malden and Somerville, to come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1360.527s">I've</a> never heard of that before or seen that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1362.707s">And</a> that's really, in my opinion, shouldn't be allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1366.128s">My</a> greater concern at the end of that whole debacle is for our large Jewish population who just a few weeks ago spoke at a city council meeting and tried to impress on them and explain to them that they feel scared in Medford and they're uncomfortable in Medford with the things that are happening and the anti-Semitism that's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1389.266s">And</a> they made it perfectly clear at that meeting, their message was received loud and clear, they just <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1395.511s">don't</a> care.
 <p>[Trish Schiapelli]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1436.308s">Well,</a> I thought it, I thought it was odd. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1439.961s">First</a> of all, coming from him because he's been, you know, so rah-rah zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1447.005s">And</a> then I thought, yeah, you know, that's actually a pretty good stunt to pass the blame on to the mayor because that's really kind of the overarching theme that I picked up. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1460.833s">And</a> as we know, the truth is the city council really has had full control of this whole process all along. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1468.62s">Now,</a> is it incumbent upon the mayor to maybe have frequent check-ins, weekly, quarterly reports? <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1476.487s">Was</a> that done? <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1477.187s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1479.169s">But</a> certainly when they had an opportunity to listen to the residents and do the right thing, they didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1487.369s">What</a> I think is more interesting is that they don't seem to be able to have a mea culpa moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1492.99s">You</a> know, you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1493.871s">We're</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1494.571s">We</a> shouldn't have done this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1495.931s">We</a> should have listened to the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1497.792s">You</a> know, an apology, in my opinion, is owed to the Salem Street residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1503.773s">And</a> I think what's really more interesting is that it doesn't appear that he actually crafted that whole message himself. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1511.375s">As</a> I found out later, the speech that he gave was verbatim to a memo that the mayor had written herself to the city councilors with regard to her thoughts on the zoning a day or two earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1527.041s">In</a> fact, her memo is actually posted out on the web, and anyone can view it and confirm this fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1532.623s">So</a> it's public information, so it isn't like I'm not. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1535.324s">But</a> again, it's just a waste of time, and not to mention another meeting violation.
 <p>[Trish Schiapelli]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1555.132s">So</a> nothing short of a complete forensic audit for at least the past three years would suffice for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1560.076s">A</a> new city council would never want to take over the funds and the books without having an accurate financial picture of where they currently are. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1568.724s">And</a> while it is true, we are already audited. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1571.586s">It</a> is someone that is state approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1574.248s">It's</a> somebody that we've used for 15 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1576.67s">And</a> I often find vendors, when you have them come in <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1580.073s">for</a> assignments such as this, in that length of time, they tend to become complacent. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1584.674s">It's</a> just, you know, dollars in, dollars out. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1586.915s">This</a> is what you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1587.915s">Of</a> course, I don't know if maybe that's because our side doesn't ask for more. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1593.337s">I'm</a> not in those meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1594.418s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1596.398s">A</a> fresh set of eyes with some new ideas to help us clean things up would be terrific and money well spent, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1602.786s">I</a> also hope that an RFP would get us a larger accounting firm that specializes in forensic accounting and can give us some financial guidance and benchmarks to reach for the years as we grow. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1613.819s">Nice.</a> 
 <p>[Trish Schiapelli]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1617.282s">One</a> more thing on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1619.823s">So</a> with regard to that and anything else that takes place, I think one of the things I would like to do is also I like the idea of putting advisory boards together with industry experts for certain tasks that can give us guidance in their respective areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1634.509s">Businesses</a> do it all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1636.61s">There</a> are CEO forums that certain CEOs join <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1640.412s">to</a> help solve problems that they experience with other CEOs. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1644.113s">And</a> it isn't uncommon when businesses are in a huge growth pattern, they put advisory boards together. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1649.994s">And</a> it isn't something that you do every week. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1651.614s">They</a> wouldn't be at every meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1652.735s">But</a> if we have a problem, and certainly something with planning, you would pull some really big, big, big developers in, like Suffolk and CTA Construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1662.657s">And</a> I know those guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1664.057s">You</a> come in and you go, hey, are we doing this right? <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1666.338s">Are</a> we looking at this right? <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1667.379s">What</a> do you recommend? <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1668.319s">And</a> even if you have two of them, you're going to get one maybe that has a different idea than the other one, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1675.642s">So</a> then you can choose. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1676.943s">And</a> so I just feel like even for finances and certain things, you need to be putting those things together to give the best city their biggest bang for their buck.
 <p>[Trish Schiapelli]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1689.208s">Absolutely.</a> 
 <p>[Trish Schiapelli]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1693.47s">I</a> know what I know, but you really, you have to be smart enough to know what you don't know, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1697.351s">Absolutely.</a> 
 <p>[Trish Schiapelli]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1717.457s">Well,</a> I mean, I don't know what they're currently using now. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1720.42s">I</a> just know what the finished product looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1723.002s">So</a> I would say absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1726.466s">And</a> a new audit team would be a part of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1730.009s">They</a> would probably, you know, I would look to someone that deals strictly with municipalities and they would probably be able to make some recommendations and then we would have them come in and we would, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1742.421s">figure</a> out which software is the best for us, given our size and maybe the growth that we're anticipating over the next 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1749.723s">And</a> then, you know, maybe pick the top two or three, and we would take it from there with an RFP and definitely update in, you know, software tailored for municipalities. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1762.668s">And</a> we need to work closer with the part and partner with each of the departments to better understand their needs and help them accurately budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1769.61s">As</a> well as monitor the process through the year, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1773.051s">So,</a> you know, what do you need? <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1775.491s">Why</a> do you need it? <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1777.052s">Have</a> an honest conversation around that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1779.092s">Try</a> to get them what they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1781.112s">You</a> know, the first couple years may be a little dicey. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1783.513s">Some</a> may run into deficit and you may need to put a line item that you lent money from this department over to this department and then you pay it back at the end of the year or you look at did you really need that money in the first place. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1794.815s">You</a> kind of balance things out as you go along. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1797.959s">But</a> within two years, you should be able to have a good handle on what your projections for that year are and not be as in an upheaval as what I think we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1807.49s">And</a> I think it's also important that there's a proper expense approval put into place. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1812.935s">with</a> regard to credit cards and with regard to what they're spent on, and regard to dollar limits and who has that dollar limit, you know, so maybe the person that is the manager of that department can approve, and I'm just making this up, up to $1,000, anything over $1,000, it has to go somewhere else, and then once you get into $5,000, it has to go to a third person. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1834.785s">And</a> so everybody is on board with that money being spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1838.427s">They</a> understand why it's being spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1840.167s">They</a> understand if there is a need right now that it has to be spent, or could it wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1844.388s">And</a> I think the citizens are owed the financial reporting that shows them exactly how their tax dollars are being spent and where. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1851.31s">And</a> if not, who approved these expenses that they don't like, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1856.431s">And</a> then have a conversation around that.
 <p>[Trish Schiapelli]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1875.253s">I</a> think the passage of the override is disgraceful. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1880.936s">I</a> think that as we all know, the votes, and you had someone else on here that can speak to this, but the votes were counted behind closed doors and in an election office where you could peek through a window if you were lucky and not even that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1898.083s">with</a> our revolution city councilor Matt Leming holding guard outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1902.365s">And</a> I know people who tried to go inside and were not allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1905.507s">The</a> whole thing is suspect and very shady. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1908.088s">And</a> I know from talking to many people in the city, I can count on my two hands the number of people who actually voted for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1917.452s">I</a> think what's so sad is they, again, were lied to by this Our Revolution city councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1923.755s">They</a> built this big program that you could go in and you could log in your house value and blah, blah, blah. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1931.119s">I</a> kept trying to tell people that calculator is not accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1934.981s">It</a> is not going to be $45 a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1938.082s">I</a> will guarantee you that because they haven't taken into, nor can they, the new assessments that are going to hit in January before that tax override is added on top of the assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1952.742s">You</a> know, for whatever reason, I think some people got that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1956.763s">It's</a> interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1957.643s">Today</a> I was talking to someone else and she said I was out there talking to a woman and she thought that 7.5% override was for the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1965.926s">So</a> I mean, I think there's just really this misinformation out there that people really don't understand or know. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1973.488s">what</a> that seven and a half percent was, and I think they understand now, as they've gotten their tax bill, that the calculators weren't right.
 <p>[Trish Schiapelli]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1983.616s">They</a> understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1984.857s">But,</a> yeah.
 <p>[Trish Schiapelli]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1989.7s">And</a> so based on some of the things that we've seen posted recently in our politics page, I understand the Department of Justice is actually investigating the whole state of Massachusetts with voter information. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=2001.689s">Yes,</a> they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=2003.058s">After</a> we have a handle on our finance and we understand where we truly are, I'd like to overturn the override in some fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=2008.761s">I'm</a> actually working on that and thinking about several different things and trying to figure out if there's a legal way to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=2016.645s">And</a> if so, what do we do? <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=2017.925s">What's</a> the easiest to do for the people? <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=2021.127s">So</a> anyway, more to come on that.
 <p>[Trish Schiapelli]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=2031.231s">No,</a> we really did.

 <p>[Trish Schiapelli]: <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=160.5s">Well,</a> I think it's probably a couple of possibilities and maybe a combination, a little bit of everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=166.642s">I</a> think that the administration has their own agenda from the mayor all the way down to the city council members, the community development board, zoning, and just the list goes on. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=179.646s">None</a> of them in particular seem to have <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=183.487s">significant</a> business experience, which is really there's processes involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=189.535s">You</a> get experience with how things should be managed. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=192.398s">And</a> their experience really for the city council consists of someone with a theater major. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=198.526s">someone</a> that couldn't get elected in Somerville, so they moved to Medford, and then they were elected to the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=205.955s">You</a> have someone on the City Council that has worked with some nonprofits and managed to bankrupt one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=212.523s">And</a> you have a lot of career students. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=217.028s">with</a> very limited life experience and no business experience as it stands. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=223.57s">They</a> think of the people of Medford are not paying attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=226.93s">And</a> up until some of the recent things that have been happening throughout the city, that is probably very true. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=232.472s">People</a> became complacent. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=234.332s">And</a> look at the meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=236.933s">Our</a> city council meetings are consumed with they all vote in a pack. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=243.114s">They</a> look at their historical trend of how they vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=247.675s">There's</a> only one outlier on the city council, and that's George Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=252.376s">Other</a> than that, you have six members. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=255.217s">They</a> all seem to vote alike. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=256.797s">And</a> you and I both know you can walk out there on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=259.498s">You're</a> not going to get five people that agree on the color of the sky, what the temperature is. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=264.439s">And</a> yet, sadly enough, they all vote together. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=267.9s">And</a> they ran on a slate. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=269.86s">I</a> think they agreed behind closed doors, from what I've heard, that they all vote in a pact. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=275.662s">And</a> so that's what they're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=277.222s">And</a> unfortunately, what that causes is we have lost democracy on our city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=285.864s">This</a> is not the democratic way. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=288.365s">You</a> should be having discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=290.646s">You</a> should be having three and four people against and for something and arguing and having in-depth conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=297.968s">And</a> we just don't have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=299.708s">And</a> one of the city councilors, <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=302.829s">just</a> a few weeks ago, Collins said, we are elected to make decisions for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=308.373s">No,</a> that is not correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=310.374s">You</a> are elected to represent us and vote how we as constituents and taxpayers would want the vote to go.
 <p>[Trish Schiapelli]: <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=358.941s">So</a> initially we went old school with standouts and this and that and the other thing and trying to go to the city council meetings and voice our opinions and it became very apparent that that isn't what they wanted to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=372.374s">So</a> I think right now we are in the throes of <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=376.318s">legal</a> action. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=377.698s">I</a> started reaching out to attorneys that I know to have conversations to start to figure out what are our legal options? <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=386.001s">Do</a> we have legal options? <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=388.501s">And</a> sadly, through the methadone experience, I quickly learned that they don't care what you think. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=394.564s">And</a> so, you know, people were completely blindsided with the fact that we were going to get a methadone dispensary. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=402.471s">We</a> gathered 550 signatures against the methadone dispensary. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=408.037s">And</a> that was gathered quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=409.478s">That</a> was gathered quickly in weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=411.279s">We</a> were running behind the eight ball with everything on that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=414.56s">We</a> were working weekends. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=417.74s">And</a> then it came time to show up to the final city council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=421.642s">And</a> we sent out emails and all the people that had been at the standouts, which was very obvious. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=427.883s">People</a> were pulling their cars over going, where is this methadone dispensary going? <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=432.125s">Right</a> here. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=433.045s">Well,</a> there's a school 0.2 miles away. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=435.367s">They</a> couldn't believe it. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=437.288s">How</a> come we haven't heard of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=438.97s">We</a> even had people on West Medford signing our petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=443.693s">And</a> I said to one woman, I said, why are you signing our petition? <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=447.056s">This</a> doesn't really affect you. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=448.737s">She</a> goes, it's Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=450.499s">We're</a> all Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=451.74s">It</a> affects all of us, right, for the city and how we are perceived. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=456.704s">And</a> so <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=458.485s">Everyone</a> showed up at that city council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=461.148s">Everyone</a> was ready to voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=462.629s">We</a> had filled that gallery and we were shut down. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=466.733s">The</a> city council president, Zach Baer, said we will not be taking public comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=471.458s">People</a> were in outrage. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=472.619s">I</a> was worried somebody was going to go actually over the rails. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=477.143s">It</a> was that bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=478.744s">And</a> so George Scarpelli got a break, and they went in the back. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=483.206s">And</a> I think he said, you know, this is not going to be good for any of us if we don't let the people that came here to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=488.888s">Sadly,</a> the majority of people had already left because they were just so frustrated. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=493.81s">And</a> I felt bad because I said, listen, if you really feel this strongly about the methadone dispensary in the neighborhood that close to a school, then please, show up. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=504.575s">Tell</a> them, I can't be the only voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=507.103s">Ten</a> of us can't be the only voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=511.663s">Anyway,</a> you know, they were just outraged. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=514.625s">And</a> George eventually got them to, who was left in the gallery, be able to come up and speak and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=523.453s">And</a> the reason I think people felt so strongly is that this Habit OpCo is really a company of bad actors. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=530.738s">They</a> have a long, long list of complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=534.001s">Every</a> city that they have gone into. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=536.843s">and</a> every city that they manage from Lynn to Springfield, they're up in arms. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=542.188s">And</a> because they purchase the buildings, they really, they have, they're property owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=547.273s">So</a> there isn't anything that the city is going to do except ask them and they very vehemently say, you know, too bad we own the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=556.501s">This</a> same company recently, <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=558.663s">had</a> an article written in the New York Times that there's a federal investigation going against them because they also own inpatient clinics for mental health and bipolar and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=572.449s">And</a> they were found, even the employees are testifying against them in the federal investigation and the federal lawsuit, that they hold people against their will. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=581.172s">If</a> you have the right kind of insurance, they're able to figure out that they're going to get paid, so they hold you against your will. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=588.675s">I</a> think that's really sad, and I think that fortunately we dodged a bullet by not letting that company into the parameters of our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=599.543s">And</a> one of the things that was so interesting in a lot of the research, our government, the Health and Human Services Division, went on to say and has done research around the methadone dispensaries, and there's a huge increase in human trafficking and <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=617.597s">things</a> like that, and sex trafficking of children around those areas, which, you know, so close to an elementary school, it just makes me shudder to think that. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=628.427s">And</a> it was then that I decided, after all of that, that really legal action was the only course that we could have where we were going to get the results that we needed immediately.
 <p>[Trish Schiapelli]: <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=667.901s">So</a> legal actions, unfortunately, did not just end with the methadone dispensary. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=673.502s">Legal</a> action and having a legal guidance, if you will, and an attorney on retainer is something that we continue with to this day. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=685.165s">We</a> believe that is our only avenue currently with this administration to really push back around if there's large numbers of people that are seeing things that they don't want. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=698.028s">And</a> the reason we have to do that is, think about it, the mayor hasn't had a solicitor in this town for three years, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=710.687s">It's</a> because the people have no legal guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=715.212s">Typically,</a> you would be able to go to the city solicitor and say, this is what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=719.917s">What</a> do you think? <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=720.938s">But</a> because we don't have that, we have no guidance for the community and for independent people to ask questions and confirm. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=732.39s">She</a> has then engaged a law firm that has allegiance to her because she's paying them, rightfully so, and now she can do whatever she wants, wherever she wants, and we are forced to live with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=747.35s">Basically,</a> she has carte blanche. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=750.173s">And</a> she's banking on the fact, and I believe, my opinion, that we don't have the wherewithal and we don't have the financial capacity to hire a law firm, a good law firm, a big Boston law firm that will represent us. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=767.881s">We</a> do. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=768.742s">And</a> we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=770.263s">And</a> while we do have the same law firm that represented us with the methadone dispensary, we have a different attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=777.868s">And</a> we did that intentionally because the attorney that we now have has a municipality expertise and specialty, which is, we feel, something that we really needed going forward with some of the things that are going on in Medford currently. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=794.359s">And</a> he's gone up against KP Law. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=797.201s">Our</a> newest fight, as I'm sure you're aware, is the Salem Street debacle that's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=805.286s">And</a> so he was able to put together and pen a very nice but strong legal letter as to why this shouldn't be taking place on Salem Street.
 <p>[Trish Schiapelli]: <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=823.903s">Oh,</a> right, yes.
 <p>[Trish Schiapelli]: <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=828.265s">Exactly,</a> yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=829.646s">She's</a> really dug in and learned a lot about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=831.927s">Yes,</a> she has.
 <p>[Trish Schiapelli]: <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=857.27s">Well,</a> obviously, all of my neighbors are concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=859.991s">But</a> then Sheryl Rodriguez, who we were just talking about, started a change.org petition online. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=867.994s">And</a> actually, as of last week, we had 980 verified signatures against the rezoning and against what the administration in this town wants to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=882.439s">I</a> think that's a strong number. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=885.826s">There</a> has, and it isn't, there just hasn't been any community outreach. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=892.669s">And</a> there was a meeting we were sitting in when they had just started talking about this and Kit Collins said, oh, if we could have knocked on every door in the Salem Street area, I would have wanted to talk to every neighbor and hear what they had to say and whether they were behind this. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=912.117s">Well,</a> you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=914.871s">put</a> that in an RFP then and have this Innis company, if they're the be all end all to community design and planning, they should be doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=926.215s">Put</a> that in the RFP. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=927.335s">That</a> is your job to take care of the people in this area of your city and make sure that they are heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=937.908s">The</a> one thing that they're overlooking is that we are an environmental justice neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=945.493s">And</a> that means, and this was put in the letter from our attorney at Richmond APC, and that is we are a racially diverse neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=956.22s">We</a> are an economically diverse neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=959.622s">We</a> are a multilingual neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=962.624s">And</a> no notice or community outreach has been done in English <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=966.967s">let</a> alone other languages for those that don't speak English. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=972.151s">And</a> that's not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=973.892s">And</a> this Salem Street rezoning has been in place since, I believe, July of last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=981.217s">And</a> the residents are just learning about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=983.799s">And</a> I find that crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=985.52s">And</a> the first community engagement didn't happen until after they received our letter from the law firm. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=994.507s">So</a> that tells you <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=996.568s">that</a> all of the people that raised concerns, many people say, oh, we brought it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1001.51s">We</a> wrote a letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1002.811s">We</a> called the Community Development Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1005.152s">No</a> action was going to be done until they got that our environmentally justice neighborhood is unhappy and the people need to be represented. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1015.836s">So</a> I think at the end of the day, we can all agree <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1019.818s">Salem</a> needs a little facelift. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1021.36s">It</a> needs some love, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1023.924s">But</a> they have not followed processes set forth in their own procedures. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1029.8s">They</a> haven't done that. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1030.86s">Therefore,</a> by law, if you haven't notified abutters and if you haven't had community engagement, and it's not just one community engagement, one time at the elementary school, six months, seven months after you've already started the process, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1048.588s">They</a> have to go all the way back and start over from the beginning, and that is what we intend to make them do. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1057.572s">There</a> have been no traffic studies, no studies on the effect to the school enrollments. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1063.655s">How</a> is that going to affect it? <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1066.037s">No</a> studies for safety, just our own safety in the neighborhood around fire and police. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1072.08s">They're</a> saying you can go four to six stories high and with eight foot between the buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1078.08s">Now,</a> does that make common sense? <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1080.223s">Our</a> streets are old. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1081.385s">We</a> are an older neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1083.367s">Very</a> narrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1084.329s">Sometimes</a> if, on my street, if you have two cars parked on either side, the fire truck really has to finagle. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1091.499s">And</a> I'm like, I hope that guy's a good driver.
 <p>[Trish Schiapelli]: <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1097.125s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1097.825s">And</a> there are just so many other problems around Salem Street area. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1104.25s">We</a> are fortunate enough to have a trained engineer working with us, and we found out many, many things that need to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1116.098s">are</a> not, and so we are bringing those all up together, and there will probably be another legal letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1123.326s">But</a> ultimately, we are interviewing attorneys for a class-action lawsuit regarding the Salem Street lack of process as defined by the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1132.996s">It</a> constitutes, from a couple of attorneys, a taking of land, if you will. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1139.042s">And</a> ultimately, above all other items, there's discrimination, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1143.524s">We</a> are an environmental justice neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1146.325s">We</a> have certain rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1147.525s">This</a> isn't taking place in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1149.566s">Why</a> is that, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1150.546s">Why</a> is nothing like this taking? <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1152.887s">So</a> that is discrimination, and we intend, you know, to see where that can go, so.
 <p>[Trish Schiapelli]: <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1210.018s">Yeah,</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1212.78s">So</a> that's really a loaded question, because there is so much going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1218.805s">We</a> could be here just for its own show, just on that, what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1223.489s">But</a> I do know that there is a 10-story dorm going in with Tufts in South Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1232.176s">The</a> neighbors were very upset about that, and rightfully so. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1234.897s">There's</a> going to be 670-some people in that dorm. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1238.858s">And</a> as one of the neighbors said, I don't want 670 people staring at me when I'm in my backyard on a Saturday or Sunday morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1249.32s">And</a> that's not even the biggest part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1251.0s">The</a> biggest part of it is they're losing sunlight. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1253.741s">We</a> already in New England don't have a lot of sunlight. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1256.402s">There's</a> sunlight studies. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1258.722s">seem</a> questionable at best, if you will. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1262.427s">And,</a> you know, so that's an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1264.89s">In</a> fact, they are using our same attorney at Richmond. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1269.375s">Those</a> people in that neighborhood have banned together. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1272.819s">Mystic</a> Avenue is <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1275.202s">In</a> the process of being rezoned, I hear 20 stories on the side that's near the water, which is crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1282.531s">You</a> know, they want to put in all of this communal living and all of these dorms and all of this, and it's not really the neighborhood environment that people and that the homeowners, the taxpayers and the voters want to live in. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1296.327s">There's</a> St. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1296.948s">Clair</a> going up where we don't even know really what's going in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1300.512s">It's</a> supposed to be, it was originally supposed to be a domestic violence shelter then, but they referred to it in their business plan as recidivism, so recidivism and domestic violence. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1314.67s">domestic</a> violence victims shouldn't really be used in the same sentence, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1320.415s">So</a> there's a lot going on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1322.517s">But</a> again, all of these projects are going on all at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1327.481s">And</a> this, again, speaks to my point where the city lacks the experience and this administration lacks the experience because there isn't a business out there unless they are <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1339.098s">a</a> staunch, sophisticated business that has done this for years and learned their lessons and made their mistakes and learned that would do this many projects at once. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1349.263s">And</a> so I would say, let's pick one project, do that one project, do it well, experience it, learn from a few mistakes, and then move on to the second project, not six projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1363.769s">I</a> hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1364.37s">Do</a> it.
 <p>[Trish Schiapelli]: <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1448.509s">Well,</a> I think that's the driving force behind all of these projects taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1455.135s">I</a> think that that's a great question. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1458.277s">And</a> I think most people living in Medford would say, when you look around and you drive around, not much, not a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1466.044s">And</a> it's as if the administration has had this epiphany that, oh my gosh, we've been in office X amount of years, and we haven't really done. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1475.749s">People</a> are still complaining about the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1477.831s">There's</a> still lead in the water. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1479.231s">There's</a> still problems at the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1481.253s">And</a> so they're trying now to overcompensate for that because there's another election coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1489.377s">You</a> know, the roads are awful and the schools are not being run efficiently, to your point, and the list just goes on. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1494.92s">There's</a> still no city solicitor, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1498.062s">Why</a> can't that be fixed in three years? <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1500.463s">And</a> there's nothing but lawsuits. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1503.185s">Nothing</a> but lawsuits. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1504.445s">And</a> as someone that's, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1507.667s">run</a> a business and run profit centers. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1510.388s">If</a> you're getting sued that often, someone should be figuring out why. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1516.009s">You</a> need to be having conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1517.909s">Who's</a> getting all of the lawsuits? <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1520.029s">Is</a> it one specific department? <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1522.01s">Is</a> it one specific manager? <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1524.21s">Is</a> it a group? <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1526.091s">Where</a> is it coming from? <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1527.551s">And</a> what is the impetus to that? <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1530.551s">And</a> how do we stop it? <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1531.912s">How</a> do we quell that from happening? <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1533.932s">But,</a> you know, what they have accomplished is they've increased taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1539.695s">They've</a> offered to give themselves salary increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1543.516s">There's</a> complete chaos in every single neighborhood except West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1548.018s">Isn't</a> that interesting? <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1550.099s">And</a> I just think that there's <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1554.621s">a</a> lot of reasons for many homeowners, taxpayers, voters, and citizens to have concern, a lot of concern.
 <p>[Trish Schiapelli]: <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1570.11s">I</a> think people... They're starting to... And you know, that's the good thing, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1574.933s">We</a> were all very sleepy and I used to say, oh, ignorance was blessed. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1579.176s">When</a> I didn't know any of this stuff was going on, it was great. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1582.719s">Now</a> my whole life is consumed with it when I'm not at work. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1587.422s">So,</a> I think, and this is the benefit, they have woken up tens of thousands of people, taxpayers and voters, that are really ticked off and fed up. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1602.814s">I</a> hear it day in and day out.
 <p>[Trish Schiapelli]: <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1619.748s">I</a> love Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1621.049s">I</a> bought my home here in 2013, and I've lived here. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1624.432s">I</a> love being in a diverse neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1627.555s">I</a> love its location to Cambridge, and you can be in and out of Boston very quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1634.881s">But</a> it's not going to get better in Medford and keep the neighborhood feel until <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1642.547s">there's</a> a change at the next election. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1644.829s">I</a> mean, that has to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1647.511s">And</a> there are certain things that we need desperately to happen that this administration just will not allow. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1656.838s">And</a> one of the things is an audit, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1658.54s">And</a> we had asked <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1660.321s">Can</a> we have an audit? <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1661.603s">Can</a> we vote on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1663.004s">And</a> unfortunately, it's Massachusetts state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1665.968s">It's</a> the only state in the country that in order for a municipality to pull an audit, you need to have all 100% vote by the city council and the mayor has to agree to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1679.904s">So,</a> and it isn't that there's any necessarily wrongdoing. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1684.325s">It's</a> just that what we see even in business is dealing with the same vendors, if you will, which is what an audit firm is, they get a little complacent. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1695.389s">and</a> don't look as hard as they should. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1697.31s">And</a> then what can we ask for from them, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1700.012s">We</a> don't get line items. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1701.433s">We</a> should have line items. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1703.274s">Was</a> that department, so without having line items for departments with specific expenses, you have the ability to move funds around. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1711.98s">Not</a> that there's anything necessarily wrong with that, as long as at the end of the day your dollars and cents balance out and you know technically where everything is. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1721.867s">But</a> the perfect example of not having a line item is they left $9 million in a checking account for a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1728.013s">And</a> they said, oops, we found a checking account. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1730.636s">How</a> do you leave $9 million in a checking account in an interest rate environment that hasn't existed in decades? <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1740.145s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1740.726s">And</a> so $9 million at a 5% interest rate <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1746.109s">100%</a> collateralized, because you would never take a risk with public funds, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1750.655s">Lost</a> us $450,000 in one year, and if it had been there for two years, well, let's do the math, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1756.864s">That's</a> a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1758.707s">But</a> again, <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1760.85s">You</a> don't know that because you don't have line items, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1763.292s">When</a> you have line items, you know every single penny, where it is, and you list all of the financial institutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1770.197s">And</a> we need to have an ethics committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1773.36s">I</a> feel really very, very strong. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1775.822s">The</a> state has an ethics committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1778.064s">We</a> can model it after what the state does for an ethics committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1783.848s">and</a> set the rules of the road that everyone has to adhere to, whether you're a developer in the city, whether you're a business owner, whether you're a taxpayer, whether you're a city councilor, whether you're the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1796.398s">Let's</a> say here's the line in the sand, and this is where we don't go over it. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1801.823s">And</a> it has to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1805.365s">It</a> just has to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1807.511s">And</a> if not, my concern and my fear is that this administration is on the way to bankrupting the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1818.757s">That's</a> my greatest fear.
 <p>[Trish Schiapelli]: <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1824.7s">I</a> mean, how many lawsuits can you take? <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1827.081s">Especially</a> if we start a class action and especially if we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1830.083s">I</a> mean, you have 947, 980 people in <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1835.703s">And</a> a class action lawsuit, that's going to be expensive.
