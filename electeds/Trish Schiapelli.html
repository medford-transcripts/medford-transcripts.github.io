    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=68.12s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=68.48s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: You may owe me one for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=69.962s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Yes, we appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=71.463s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We really do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=72.404s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: But thank you so much for having me back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=75.686s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I always enjoy the show, and I'm happy to be here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=78.208s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We enjoy having you here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=92.06s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Well, I originally moved to Massachusetts in 1998 to complete my MBA at Simmons University in their Graduate School of Management.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=104.827s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I graduated in 2001.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=107.388s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I have 20 plus years experience as a commercial lender.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=111.33s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: in the banking industry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=113.511s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I work with CEOs and CFOs of companies with revenues in the size of $10 million to $60 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=120.132s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I help them acquire debt, refinance existing debt, purchase their real estate, whatever they may need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=127.353s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I also help them with their cash cycles in their business so that they can get paid faster, hang on to their money a little bit longer, and then make their payments in a faster, more secure environment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=138.035s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So I am currently a Medford resident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=141.376s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And I moved here in 2009.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=143.297s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I lived at Station Landing first for just a little over four years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=147.317s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And I really loved that development with the access to the T and just being so close to so many things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=153.799s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And then in 2013, I actually bought my home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=159.24s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So I actually enjoy the house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=161.721s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: It's a Victorian.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=171.988s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=188.509s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Yeah, sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=189.29s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So I am running for city council because, first of all, I live in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=194.397s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And I think it has a tremendous amount of potential and opportunity given its proximity to Boston, Cambridge, and access to the 93.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=203.943s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Unfortunately, I believe it's my opinion that it's being horribly mismanaged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=208.666s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And that is something that if elected to the city council, I would really want to change and improve<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=217.911s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And as you know, the first debacle I became involved in was the methadone dispensary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=223.698s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: That was my wake up moment if you will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=227.883s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I have to your point what are my concerns, I have a very long list of concerns to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=236.293s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: honest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=237.133s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And the first one is my concern is if we stay on this trajectory and we don't have some drastic changes sooner rather than later, that we may hit a point where there's a point of no return.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=248.579s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And I believe that we are in a current downward spiral and we need to correct that as soon as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=255.983s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: It is going to be a heavy lift.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=258.064s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: absolutely, given the current circumstances and the six years of the current administration and city council, who in my opinion have really done nothing except raise our taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=268.291s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Of course, they must think we're all blind and that because we can't see that nothing is being done in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=275.956s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: With our tax money, our roads and sidewalks and water are still not fixed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=280.679s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: in desperate need of repair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=282.881s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: However, they have managed to throw the city into a complete chaos with this radical rezoning that they pulled out of thin air and decided to thrust onto the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=311.814s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=312.815s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And I'm going to start at the top with the mayor, which I think is where the buck stops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=317.456s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And while she is running unopposed, which I find shocking to say the least,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=322.344s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: If she has any interest in saving her reputation and her legacy as the mayor of Medford, I believe she needs to do three very difficult things immediately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=333.668s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: The first thing is she needs to deny the city council their request for additional funds for the zoning studies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=341.466s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: The second thing is she needs to fire consulting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=345.29s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: They are lacking in experience for the project of this size and the location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=350.456s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: They were not the right decision for the project in the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=353.339s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: The largest project they have done is out in a smaller town past 128.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=360.247s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And an example of why I think they really need to be fired and we shouldn't be giving them any more money is at a recent presentation at city council when questioned about some of the streets in the homes that were going to be changed with this zoning, they admitted that they hadn't driven<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=377.31s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: by the actual addresses or walked through any of the neighborhoods to really understand the lot size and the types of houses their planning is going to affect with this radical rezoning, but rather they chose to rely on Google Maps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=391.813s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Seriously?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=393.574s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: That's what we're paying for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=394.894s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I just was really kind of shocked by that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=400.444s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Then the third thing, the mayor absolutely needs to immediately, because it is so long overdue, I believe, in my opinion, she needs to fire Alicia Hunt immediately today for her pandering to developers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=413.817s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: It's really inconscionable and that's just a period, full stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=418.601s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So once those three things have been done on the city side to really help<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=424.146s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: reflect and make some changes that we can all live with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=428.028s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: She has a chance to resume herself with the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=431.17s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And then the next thing that needs to happen is it falls to the actual citizens in the city, the good people that live here, the people that vote, the people that want to help and do their part in saving the city and their respective neighborhoods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=447.04s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And it is really very simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=449.701s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: The voters need to vote out every single Our Revolution city councilor, full stop, period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=460.045s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And I'm going to repeat that, and they may need to write it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=463.446s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: The voters need to vote out every single Our Revolution city councilor if they want to take back their city and have a decent city with neighborhoods that they can live in and enjoy and have a say in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=476.97s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Full stop, no questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=479.961s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So who do they vote for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=482.023s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: The voters then need to pick independent candidates who will listen to them and put Medford first, not be all involved in a national agenda and with things that aren't even pertaining to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=495.334s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And you have to be careful because not all of those saying that they're independents are true independents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=501.039s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: A couple are questionable because they really don't want to take a hard line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=506.327s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And this is an election about a hard line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=508.67s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: You take a position, you pick a hill, you live and die on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=514.058s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And that's what this city needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=516.821s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And so one of my favorite sayings is the definition of crazy is doing the same thing over and expecting different results.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=524.847s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We have been doing the same thing over for six years and expecting different results, and we have not gotten any.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=531.172s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So once there is a turnover,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=532.933s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Then we can roll up our sleeves and really the hard work can begin and we must review rezoning and decide what gets changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=541.518s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We must demand a forensic audit and demand 21st century standards for how we are reporting our finances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=549.625s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: and how we show the taxpayers of this city exactly where their taxpayer dollars are being spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=556.492s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Right now, accountable and transparent with this administration is really just a word salad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=562.198s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I looked at our budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=563.099s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: It consists of three lines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=565.401s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: It consists of revenue, expenses, deficit or surplus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=570.325s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=571.186s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Annual reports are really not much better and don't provide a lot of additional information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=577.129s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I actually reached out to our CPA audit firm in Woburn and more than once and crickets, of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=587.353s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So, we need to really work together and partner with each department in the city and hold people accountable for the people's tax dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=596.102s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And that isn't as difficult as it sounds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=598.925s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We need to understand where surplus and deficits are coming from so that we can stop the gaps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=604.671s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Otherwise, we just continue to rob Peter to pay Paul.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=609.815s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We need to fix our roads desperately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=612.736s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We need to fix our sidewalks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=614.537s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We need to get the lead out of our water system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=617.058s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We need to fix our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=620.4s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: The scores are abhorrent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=622.901s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And I think I would like to see an ethics guideline added in there for city councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=627.763s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=628.764s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So I think that's important so that we're all playing by the same rules no matter what position you're in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=635.271s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: That's important to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=636.793s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And finally, the people of Medford need to know that every Tuesday night there will be a city council meeting that is consistency is the key.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=644.901s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: They can come home, turn on their TV or log in online and we will be there in chamber<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=650.787s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: every Tuesday night to discuss and update them on all of the items that we are in the process of working through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=657.61s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: These marathon meetings until midnight or later, because they only meet every other week because that is what is convenient for them, really isn't working.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=667.353s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: The citizens of this city have jobs, they have kids, they have a life to live.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=671.515s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Also, it will get rid of all these side meetings behind closed doors, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=675.576s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: If we go to meetings every week, the citizens of this city will have the right to hear the facts and the figures and hear the presentation of the pros and cons between their city council members and better understand the concepts of how it will affect them as we move through the discussion of the facts and the figures and research prior to an item being moved to a vote so that they will feel a little more comfortable<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=700.721s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: hopefully with the decisions being made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=702.702s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Of course we would still always have open comments and they would have the right to ask questions and maybe we could delve through it a little bit better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=709.845s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: But I really feel like they've been kept out of the loop and no one has the time and the wherewithal to go look everything up and read through 16 pages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=718.529s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: That's our job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=719.55s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Then we're going to boil it down and give it to the citizens of Medford so that they can understand what's going on as is their right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=746.435s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Well, so I think that, yes, they were misled, but I think that my position on zoning is that we absolutely must improve our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=756.378s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I think as you drive around, it has the potential to be a beautiful city, but right now it looks tired and dirty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=761.879s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We have to be thoughtful about any zoning that we do and look at the zoning as a total number and how it's going to be affected with the city with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=771.762s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: our resources such as zoning and sewer and things like that, we already had the DPW leader come in and say, you have to give me a number, you have to give me a number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=781.847s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So they can't give them a number, they're just adding, throwing people at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=785.409s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: At some point we're going to end up like other cities were with brownouts and sewage running down your streets, sewage backup during horrible storms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=794.673s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So I actually think that the city of Medford is at a crossroads right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=798.136s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We have the luxury to design a thoughtful city where people want to live and one that will drive visitors from contiguous cities to come here and spend dollars and enjoy some time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=810.066s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: The zoning decisions that we make now will define us as a city going forward for many, many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=815.59s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And we will either be like Somerville, where so many people say, oh, gosh, I lived there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=820.074s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: It used to be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=820.934s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: It isn't anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=821.875s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: You're jam-packed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=822.756s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: It's miserable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=824.157s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: They don't want to live in Somerville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=825.438s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: People are starting to move out of Cambridge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=827.558s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Or we choose to be smart and manage growth responsibly, where we can keep green spaces, have homes available for people through every season of their life and what they need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=838.643s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And in which case, we would be more like Belmont, Winchester, possibly even Melrose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=844.285s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I would like to see us take that direction and have smart growth, not just throw in density.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=852.608s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: But to even imply, as our revolution city councilor Matt Leming did, that gone are the days of a single family house,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=864.067s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: is really just ludicrous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=866.208s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I think people will always have a need for a single family home and want to choose that as their option of a place to live.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=874.552s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: They suffer from the delusion that all growth is good growth, and as we know in business and finance, that isn't necessarily the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=881.955s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Growth that is too fast actually drives up costs and takes a toll on the existing situation and the existing assets, and you can actually put<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=891.86s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: the company, or in this case the city, in a deficit position if not monitored and managed appropriately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=898.682s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I've seen it happen firsthand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=901.063s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So interesting legal fact that I've done some research, I've talked to a couple of attorneys in preparing for this, and zoning laws are in place to protect the property owners<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=912.007s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: not for the city to use and change as they see fit in a desperate cry for additional tax dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=920.014s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Zoning laws initially were established so that you can buy property and not worry that one day you will wake up to a 10-story building next door to your house or a factory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=932.927s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: In fact, zoning ordinances have a valid legal interest in protecting the character of the neighborhood, not destroying the character of the neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=945.597s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And this gets back to the taking of land that we had had a conversation about a while ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=950.781s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: When you buy a home, you are entitled to certain rights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=954.344s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And that right is that you have a say in the neighborhood that you live in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=959.269s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And the laws are very clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=961.671s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And there are actually two Supreme Court cases, one in 1926 and one in 1928, that actually involved Cambridge, where a zoning ordinance had depleted the plaintiff's property value, and the Supreme Court overturned it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=977.645s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So I feel if we continue down this road and things get as bad as some projections think that they could be with what they want to do, there is going to be a plethora of lawsuits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=991.282s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So get ready.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=992.975s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So Medford is just really just waking up to the truth about what is going on in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=996.877s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And my concern right now is for West Medford because I'm worried that they will now get lulled into a false sense of security with the zoning being delayed to March 2026 only to one day wake up and realize<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1011.223s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: exactly the ugly scenario that Salem Street is in and the reality, and that is that our sneaky Our Revolution City Councilor Matt Leming in the dead of the night around 11 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1023.85s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: after the Community Development Board had agreed to the request of the homeowners and we had a completely different neighborhood negotiated, Councilor Matt Leming reversed the request to the original zoning and all six of Our Revolution Councilors voted for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1040.72s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Again, don't be fooled, West Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1044.721s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: If reelected, this city council will do the same thing to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1052.463s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Don't let it happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1054.824s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: There is another saying I like to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1056.725s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: People show you who they are and you better believe them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1059.905s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And they've shown me on several occasions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1062.986s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Radical rezoning must stop, period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1071.245s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: It's the truth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1073.046s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And there's so many things that people in the city don't know, and I think unless you live in the Salem Street corridor, you really don't understand what happened to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1080.934s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I think people have to go back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1081.995s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And how egregious it was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1091.969s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And those cases, to this day, have never been overturned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1115.123s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So I would focus on making the city more business-friendly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1118.025s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I hear we're not really that friendly to businesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1120.687s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And I would make a target list of companies that our city and residents would like to have in Medford and companies that maybe are not available to the contiguous cities that we have that would then drive visitors to our city to see certain things and then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1139.048s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: increase bottom line we need to increase our commercial tax base.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1142.35s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: The homeowners really just can't continue to take the hit for that because our administration doesn't know how to attract or negotiate with certain<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1155.057s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: certain entities and I feel like you know the Budweiser campus is a perfect example of something that took place and we should have been working with the owners of that and I feel like some of the leadership could have gone there and said thank you so much for you know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1171.288s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: being here all these years and leasing and I understand Budweiser has had to move out because of their, but what can you do to help us and we understand that it's around price and you could even cut a side deal with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1187.17s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I mean, right now we're losing 600,000, but if you said to them, listen, I understand price is important, but if somebody comes in with a million three and they're a few hundred thousand dollars short, let's go with the lesser and we'll pay you back 200,000 a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1201.872s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: year for three or four years to make up that difference in that sale price, and we're still $400,000 or $500,000 ahead in tax revenue, versus just giving it to the MBTA and then saying, oh, you know, we're losing, we're at a deficit for $600,000 a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1218.376s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And things like that are done all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1219.896s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I know they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1224.457s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Well, yeah, that is definitely something I would have advised one of my clients to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1228.218s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1228.778s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1228.978s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Don't let that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1229.639s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: If you really want that building, don't let it go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1231.379s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Go in and try to negotiate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1232.62s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: What's the worst they're going to say is absolutely not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1234.621s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1234.921s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1235.281s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So you're back to square one, but at least you try.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1237.082s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: At least you can say to the good people of Medford, I tried to save us $400,000 to $600,000 in tax revenue, and here's what I did, and they refused to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1245.985s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Looks a lot better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1267.711s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1268.052s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I sat through that whole torture show the other night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1271.314s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: It was a torture show.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1272.314s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I thought it was laughable and a complete waste of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1275.556s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Four hours of nonsense and four hours of my life that I'll never get back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1279.139s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And they insist on focusing their attention and prioritizing things that are not local and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1286.283s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: things that are happening thousands of miles away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1288.886s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And I could see if everything was glorious here in Medford, and our roads were fixed, and our sidewalks were perfect, and the birds were humming, and everything was beautiful, and our parkways were perfectly planted, not with weeds and overgrowth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1303.181s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: But I think they did it for a reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1306.544s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I think there was a strategy behind it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1308.546s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And I think it was a much-needed diversion for them so that people can focus on something other than their inept management of the city and their failure at the rezoning, given what's been transpiring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1322.297s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And as they've already confirmed, like three and a half hours into the meeting, I believe it was, they said, oh, well, by the way, we already knew from the investment company they had let us know that we really didn't have an exorbitant amount of percentage that is out of our guideline in those companies anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1341.922s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Oh, my God.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1343.062s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Are you kidding me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1344.603s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: They wasted all that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1346.203s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: You could have just changed the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1347.844s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: You could have made the announcement and said we wanted to save everyone's time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1352.865s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: But no, they didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1353.925s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And so what I thought was fascinating is that they actually allowed people from other cities, Malden and Somerville, to come up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1360.527s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I've never heard of that before or seen that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1362.707s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And that's really, in my opinion, shouldn't be allowed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1366.128s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: My greater concern at the end of that whole debacle is for our large Jewish population who just a few weeks ago spoke at a city council meeting and tried to impress on them and explain to them that they feel scared in Medford and they're uncomfortable in Medford with the things that are happening and the anti-Semitism that's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1389.266s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And they made it perfectly clear at that meeting, their message was received loud and clear, they just<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1395.511s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: don't care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1436.308s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Well, I thought it, I thought it was odd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1439.961s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: First of all, coming from him because he's been, you know, so rah-rah zoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1447.005s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And then I thought, yeah, you know, that's actually a pretty good stunt to pass the blame on to the mayor because that's really kind of the overarching theme that I picked up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1460.833s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And as we know, the truth is the city council really has had full control of this whole process all along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1468.62s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Now, is it incumbent upon the mayor to maybe have frequent check-ins, weekly, quarterly reports?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1476.487s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Was that done?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1477.187s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1479.169s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: But certainly when they had an opportunity to listen to the residents and do the right thing, they didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1487.369s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: What I think is more interesting is that they don't seem to be able to have a mea culpa moment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1492.99s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: You know, you're right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1493.871s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We're sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1494.571s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We shouldn't have done this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1495.931s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We should have listened to the residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1497.792s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: You know, an apology, in my opinion, is owed to the Salem Street residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1503.773s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And I think what's really more interesting is that it doesn't appear that he actually crafted that whole message himself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1511.375s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: As I found out later, the speech that he gave was verbatim to a memo that the mayor had written herself to the city councilors with regard to her thoughts on the zoning a day or two earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1527.041s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: In fact, her memo is actually posted out on the web, and anyone can view it and confirm this fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1532.623s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So it's public information, so it isn't like I'm not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1535.324s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: But again, it's just a waste of time, and not to mention another meeting violation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1555.132s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So nothing short of a complete forensic audit for at least the past three years would suffice for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1560.076s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: A new city council would never want to take over the funds and the books without having an accurate financial picture of where they currently are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1568.724s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And while it is true, we are already audited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1571.586s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: It is someone that is state approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1574.248s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: It's somebody that we've used for 15 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1576.67s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And I often find vendors, when you have them come in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1580.073s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: for assignments such as this, in that length of time, they tend to become complacent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1584.674s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: It's just, you know, dollars in, dollars out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1586.915s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: This is what you want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1587.915s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Of course, I don't know if maybe that's because our side doesn't ask for more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1593.337s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I'm not in those meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1594.418s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1596.398s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: A fresh set of eyes with some new ideas to help us clean things up would be terrific and money well spent, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1602.786s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I also hope that an RFP would get us a larger accounting firm that specializes in forensic accounting and can give us some financial guidance and benchmarks to reach for the years as we grow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1613.819s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Nice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1617.282s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: One more thing on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1619.823s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So with regard to that and anything else that takes place, I think one of the things I would like to do is also I like the idea of putting advisory boards together with industry experts for certain tasks that can give us guidance in their respective areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1634.509s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Businesses do it all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1636.61s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: There are CEO forums that certain CEOs join<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1640.412s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: to help solve problems that they experience with other CEOs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1644.113s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And it isn't uncommon when businesses are in a huge growth pattern, they put advisory boards together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1649.994s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And it isn't something that you do every week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1651.614s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: They wouldn't be at every meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1652.735s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: But if we have a problem, and certainly something with planning, you would pull some really big, big, big developers in, like Suffolk and CTA Construction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1662.657s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And I know those guys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1664.057s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: You come in and you go, hey, are we doing this right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1666.338s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Are we looking at this right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1667.379s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: What do you recommend?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1668.319s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And even if you have two of them, you're going to get one maybe that has a different idea than the other one, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1675.642s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So then you can choose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1676.943s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And so I just feel like even for finances and certain things, you need to be putting those things together to give the best city their biggest bang for their buck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1689.208s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1693.47s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I know what I know, but you really, you have to be smart enough to know what you don't know, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1697.351s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1717.457s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Well, I mean, I don't know what they're currently using now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1720.42s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I just know what the finished product looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1723.002s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So I would say absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1726.466s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And a new audit team would be a part of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1730.009s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: They would probably, you know, I would look to someone that deals strictly with municipalities and they would probably be able to make some recommendations and then we would have them come in and we would, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1742.421s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: figure out which software is the best for us, given our size and maybe the growth that we're anticipating over the next 10 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1749.723s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And then, you know, maybe pick the top two or three, and we would take it from there with an RFP and definitely update in, you know, software tailored for municipalities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1762.668s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And we need to work closer with the part and partner with each of the departments to better understand their needs and help them accurately budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1769.61s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: As well as monitor the process through the year, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1773.051s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So, you know, what do you need?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1775.491s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Why do you need it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1777.052s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Have an honest conversation around that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1779.092s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Try to get them what they need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1781.112s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: You know, the first couple years may be a little dicey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1783.513s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Some may run into deficit and you may need to put a line item that you lent money from this department over to this department and then you pay it back at the end of the year or you look at did you really need that money in the first place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1794.815s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: You kind of balance things out as you go along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1797.959s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: But within two years, you should be able to have a good handle on what your projections for that year are and not be as in an upheaval as what I think we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1807.49s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And I think it's also important that there's a proper expense approval put into place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1812.935s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: with regard to credit cards and with regard to what they're spent on, and regard to dollar limits and who has that dollar limit, you know, so maybe the person that is the manager of that department can approve, and I'm just making this up, up to $1,000, anything over $1,000, it has to go somewhere else, and then once you get into $5,000, it has to go to a third person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1834.785s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And so everybody is on board with that money being spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1838.427s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: They understand why it's being spent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1840.167s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: They understand if there is a need right now that it has to be spent, or could it wait.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1844.388s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And I think the citizens are owed the financial reporting that shows them exactly how their tax dollars are being spent and where.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1851.31s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And if not, who approved these expenses that they don't like, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1856.431s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And then have a conversation around that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1875.253s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I think the passage of the override is disgraceful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1880.936s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I think that as we all know, the votes, and you had someone else on here that can speak to this, but the votes were counted behind closed doors and in an election office where you could peek through a window if you were lucky and not even that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1898.083s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: with our revolution city councilor Matt Leming holding guard outside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1902.365s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And I know people who tried to go inside and were not allowed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1905.507s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: The whole thing is suspect and very shady.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1908.088s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And I know from talking to many people in the city, I can count on my two hands the number of people who actually voted for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1917.452s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I think what's so sad is they, again, were lied to by this Our Revolution city councilor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1923.755s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: They built this big program that you could go in and you could log in your house value and blah, blah, blah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1931.119s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I kept trying to tell people that calculator is not accurate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1934.981s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: It is not going to be $45 a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1938.082s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I will guarantee you that because they haven't taken into, nor can they, the new assessments that are going to hit in January before that tax override is added on top of the assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1952.742s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: You know, for whatever reason, I think some people got that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1956.763s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: It's interesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1957.643s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Today I was talking to someone else and she said I was out there talking to a woman and she thought that 7.5% override was for the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1965.926s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So I mean, I think there's just really this misinformation out there that people really don't understand or know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1973.488s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: what that seven and a half percent was, and I think they understand now, as they've gotten their tax bill, that the calculators weren't right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1983.616s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: They understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1984.857s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: But, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=1989.7s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And so based on some of the things that we've seen posted recently in our politics page, I understand the Department of Justice is actually investigating the whole state of Massachusetts with voter information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=2001.689s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Yes, they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=2003.058s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: After we have a handle on our finance and we understand where we truly are, I'd like to overturn the override in some fashion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=2008.761s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I'm actually working on that and thinking about several different things and trying to figure out if there's a legal way to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=2016.645s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And if so, what do we do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=2017.925s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: What's the easiest to do for the people?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=2021.127s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So anyway, more to come on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=2031.231s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: No, we really did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=2057.557s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Oh, a fun question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=2058.758s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: OK, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=2059.558s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So my least favorite thing to do in Medford is drive around and hit potholes all the time with my car.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=2069.864s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And then deal with the bike lane.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=2073.006s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I'm going to end up with a hood ornament someday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=2075.167s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: If there was ever anybody in there, I would probably have them as a hood ornament.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=2078.088s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: But there's never anyone in there, thankfully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=2080.67s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: But it seems like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=2082.991s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: No one's in them, they're a pain in the neck, and all they do is make traffic worse that's already bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=2088.852s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And then another genius idea by the administration to just put bike lanes in regardless of whether the people want them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=2095.994s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: My favorite thing is I love our library.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=2097.714s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I love going to the library and perusing some books.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=2100.535s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I check out books there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=2104.536s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I enjoy just spending a few quiet hours there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=2106.758s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Everyone is very helpful and super nice, and it's just an enjoyable time when I get to go there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=2122.128s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And they have some nice events there as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=2134.816s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Oh, that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=2136.937s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=2139.159s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=2162.639s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Well, if they haven't heard enough already and they want more opinions from me, they can e-mail me at Trish for Medford at gmail.com.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=2174.087s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So Trish, T-R-I-S-H, the number for Medford at gmail.com.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=2180.771s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Or text me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=2181.572s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I have a phone number set up specifically for this at 617-620-7845.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=2189.297s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Again, that's 617-620-7845.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WX-UWIC6r6A&t=2197.864s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Thank you for having me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5870.684s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Good evening, Trisha Kelly, 53 Garfield Avenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5875.045s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So in my opinion, I agree that we do need more housing and we need a facelift in Medford and we do need to get up to date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5882.449s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I do not think, however, that we have done enough thought process and strategic thinking on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5889.592s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: My concern is that there's never been any conversation around what the infrastructure can handle with regard to electric.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5896.755s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: sewer, water, all the lead pipes that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5900.236s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So I feel to add more density without really fixing some of the things that we have first is going to cause brownouts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5909.59s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: sewage backups during horrible, horrible storms and other issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5915.231s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So I think that we need to fix what we have and then be thoughtful and in a process and then bring people in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5923.493s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: What can the police handle?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5924.754s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We've never had a conversation around that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5926.774s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: What can fire handle?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5928.315s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And why would you ever<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5930.075s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: say that Medford, the gone are the days of the single family house, like some of the people on city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5936.58s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: That is what Medford was built on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5938.501s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And I feel like if the state can push back on the federal government for things they don't want to do, I believe that our city should be able to push back on the state with what the majority of homeowners, property owners, taxpayers and voters would like in the environment that they want to live.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5959.177s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=10821.03s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Hi, good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=10821.851s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Patricia Ciappelli, 53 Garfield Avenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=10824.493s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I would like to say that the zoning is climate action and it's going to meet our climate goals is laughable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=10835.781s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: It's also laughable to say that it's going to meet our affordable housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=10839.684s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: It is not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=10841.085s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And to say that it's going to raise tax money, it will not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=10844.55s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And the simple reason is the infrastructure studies haven't been done and the cost that it's going to take on wear and tear on our electric grids, on our sewer, on our water is going to be insurmountable and somebody is going to have to pay for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=10858.308s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And at the end of the day, if we're at a break-even, I would consider us lucky.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=10862.652s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So I think we do need to stick to, I am opposed to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=10866.695s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I think you need to go back and do the feasibility studies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=10869.597s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Start from the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=10871.099s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Do it the right way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=10873.361s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Don't cut corners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=10874.942s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I understand this is a big project and we haven't done this before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=10878.545s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: All the more reason to do it the right way so we have the right knowledge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=10882.988s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And so again, I'm against this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=10885.59s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I am right in the thick of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=10891.534s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And we are already in the hot, hot zone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=10894.656s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: If you look at a climate map, we are red, red, red.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/llQSZsu-6bs&t=10899.639s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So to say we're gonna flip to green by adding more people doesn't work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mPeOR452BSI&t=5344.835s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: The map already has us in a very hot,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mPeOR452BSI&t=5348.817s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: It's mostly yellow and red.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mPeOR452BSI&t=5394.528s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Because I have been with one of those people that died on a Saturday night because I heard the accident and I came off my porch to go help the lady.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mPeOR452BSI&t=5405.857s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So you need to do some research.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mPeOR452BSI&t=5408.299s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: You need to understand what the traffic is that goes up and down this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=77.71s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Well, thank you for having me, John.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=79.871s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: It's a pleasure to be here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=80.831s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I think in May of 2024, I found some information from some neighbors that there was a methadone dispensary that was going to be going in on Salem Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=93.714s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: As an abutter, I had never been notified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=96.514s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And when I started talking to many of my neighbors and people in the neighborhood, they had not been notified either that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=103.756s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: this methadone dispensary was coming in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=106.537s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And so through looking at where they were going to place the methadone dispensary, it was .2 miles from an elementary school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=113.8s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So I contacted the Attorney General's office and said, this is crazy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=118.122s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: How can you let a methadone dispensary be .2 miles from an elementary school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=124.565s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: You can't even put, and as he said to me, you can't even put a liquor store that close to an elementary school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=130.908s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I said, or a cannabis shop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=132.308s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: He said, exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=133.749s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So, that's really what started and was the impetus to me gathering some neighbors together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=139.954s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: What do you think of this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=141.295s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Are you concerned?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=142.596s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: What are we going to do about it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=160.5s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Well, I think it's probably a couple of possibilities and maybe a combination, a little bit of everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=166.642s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I think that the administration has their own agenda from the mayor all the way down to the city council members, the community development board, zoning, and just the list goes on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=179.646s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: None of them in particular seem to have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=183.487s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: significant business experience, which is really there's processes involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=189.535s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: You get experience with how things should be managed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=192.398s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And their experience really for the city council consists of someone with a theater major.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=198.526s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: someone that couldn't get elected in Somerville, so they moved to Medford, and then they were elected to the City Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=205.955s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: You have someone on the City Council that has worked with some nonprofits and managed to bankrupt one of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=212.523s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And you have a lot of career students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=217.028s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: with very limited life experience and no business experience as it stands.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=223.57s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: They think of the people of Medford are not paying attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=226.93s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And up until some of the recent things that have been happening throughout the city, that is probably very true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=232.472s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: People became complacent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=234.332s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And look at the meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=236.933s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Our city council meetings are consumed with they all vote in a pack.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=243.114s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: They look at their historical trend of how they vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=247.675s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: There's only one outlier on the city council, and that's George Scarpelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=252.376s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Other than that, you have six members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=255.217s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: They all seem to vote alike.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=256.797s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And you and I both know you can walk out there on the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=259.498s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: You're not going to get five people that agree on the color of the sky, what the temperature is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=264.439s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And yet, sadly enough, they all vote together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=267.9s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And they ran on a slate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=269.86s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I think they agreed behind closed doors, from what I've heard, that they all vote in a pact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=275.662s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And so that's what they're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=277.222s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And unfortunately, what that causes is we have lost democracy on our city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=285.864s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: This is not the democratic way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=288.365s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: You should be having discussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=290.646s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: You should be having three and four people against and for something and arguing and having in-depth conversations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=297.968s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And we just don't have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=299.708s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And one of the city councilors,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=302.829s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: just a few weeks ago, Collins said, we are elected to make decisions for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=308.373s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: No, that is not correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=310.374s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: You are elected to represent us and vote how we as constituents and taxpayers would want the vote to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=358.941s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So initially we went old school with standouts and this and that and the other thing and trying to go to the city council meetings and voice our opinions and it became very apparent that that isn't what they wanted to hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=372.374s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So I think right now we are in the throes of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=376.318s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: legal action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=377.698s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I started reaching out to attorneys that I know to have conversations to start to figure out what are our legal options?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=386.001s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Do we have legal options?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=388.501s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And sadly, through the methadone experience, I quickly learned that they don't care what you think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=394.564s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And so, you know, people were completely blindsided with the fact that we were going to get a methadone dispensary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=402.471s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We gathered 550 signatures against the methadone dispensary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=408.037s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And that was gathered quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=409.478s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: That was gathered quickly in weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=411.279s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We were running behind the eight ball with everything on that one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=414.56s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We were working weekends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=417.74s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And then it came time to show up to the final city council meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=421.642s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And we sent out emails and all the people that had been at the standouts, which was very obvious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=427.883s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: People were pulling their cars over going, where is this methadone dispensary going?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=432.125s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Right here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=433.045s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Well, there's a school 0.2 miles away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=435.367s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: They couldn't believe it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=437.288s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: How come we haven't heard of this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=438.97s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We even had people on West Medford signing our petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=443.693s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And I said to one woman, I said, why are you signing our petition?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=447.056s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: This doesn't really affect you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=448.737s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: She goes, it's Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=450.499s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We're all Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=451.74s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: It affects all of us, right, for the city and how we are perceived.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=456.704s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And so<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=458.485s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Everyone showed up at that city council meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=461.148s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Everyone was ready to voice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=462.629s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We had filled that gallery and we were shut down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=466.733s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: The city council president, Zach Baer, said we will not be taking public comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=471.458s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: People were in outrage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=472.619s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I was worried somebody was going to go actually over the rails.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=477.143s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: It was that bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=478.744s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And so George Scarpelli got a break, and they went in the back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=483.206s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And I think he said, you know, this is not going to be good for any of us if we don't let the people that came here to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=488.888s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Sadly, the majority of people had already left because they were just so frustrated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=493.81s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And I felt bad because I said, listen, if you really feel this strongly about the methadone dispensary in the neighborhood that close to a school, then please, show up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=504.575s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Tell them, I can't be the only voice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=507.103s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Ten of us can't be the only voice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=511.663s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Anyway, you know, they were just outraged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=514.625s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And George eventually got them to, who was left in the gallery, be able to come up and speak and things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=523.453s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And the reason I think people felt so strongly is that this Habit OpCo is really a company of bad actors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=530.738s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: They have a long, long list of complaints.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=534.001s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Every city that they have gone into.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=536.843s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: and every city that they manage from Lynn to Springfield, they're up in arms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=542.188s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And because they purchase the buildings, they really, they have, they're property owners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=547.273s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So there isn't anything that the city is going to do except ask them and they very vehemently say, you know, too bad we own the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=556.501s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: This same company recently,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=558.663s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: had an article written in the New York Times that there's a federal investigation going against them because they also own inpatient clinics for mental health and bipolar and things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=572.449s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And they were found, even the employees are testifying against them in the federal investigation and the federal lawsuit, that they hold people against their will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=581.172s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: If you have the right kind of insurance, they're able to figure out that they're going to get paid, so they hold you against your will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=588.675s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I think that's really sad, and I think that fortunately we dodged a bullet by not letting that company into the parameters of our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=599.543s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And one of the things that was so interesting in a lot of the research, our government, the Health and Human Services Division, went on to say and has done research around the methadone dispensaries, and there's a huge increase in human trafficking and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=617.597s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: things like that, and sex trafficking of children around those areas, which, you know, so close to an elementary school, it just makes me shudder to think that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=628.427s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And it was then that I decided, after all of that, that really legal action was the only course that we could have where we were going to get the results that we needed immediately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=667.901s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So legal actions, unfortunately, did not just end with the methadone dispensary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=673.502s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Legal action and having a legal guidance, if you will, and an attorney on retainer is something that we continue with to this day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=685.165s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We believe that is our only avenue currently with this administration to really push back around if there's large numbers of people that are seeing things that they don't want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=698.028s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And the reason we have to do that is, think about it, the mayor hasn't had a solicitor in this town for three years, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=710.687s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: It's because the people have no legal guidance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=715.212s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Typically, you would be able to go to the city solicitor and say, this is what's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=719.917s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: What do you think?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=720.938s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: But because we don't have that, we have no guidance for the community and for independent people to ask questions and confirm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=732.39s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: She has then engaged a law firm that has allegiance to her because she's paying them, rightfully so, and now she can do whatever she wants, wherever she wants, and we are forced to live with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=747.35s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Basically, she has carte blanche.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=750.173s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And she's banking on the fact, and I believe, my opinion, that we don't have the wherewithal and we don't have the financial capacity to hire a law firm, a good law firm, a big Boston law firm that will represent us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=767.881s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=768.742s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=770.263s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And while we do have the same law firm that represented us with the methadone dispensary, we have a different attorney.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=777.868s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And we did that intentionally because the attorney that we now have has a municipality expertise and specialty, which is, we feel, something that we really needed going forward with some of the things that are going on in Medford currently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=794.359s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And he's gone up against KP Law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=797.201s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Our newest fight, as I'm sure you're aware, is the Salem Street debacle that's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=805.286s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And so he was able to put together and pen a very nice but strong legal letter as to why this shouldn't be taking place on Salem Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=823.903s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Oh, right, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=828.265s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Exactly, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=829.646s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: She's really dug in and learned a lot about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=831.927s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Yes, she has.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=857.27s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Well, obviously, all of my neighbors are concerned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=859.991s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: But then Sheryl Rodriguez, who we were just talking about, started a change.org petition online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=867.994s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And actually, as of last week, we had 980 verified signatures against the rezoning and against what the administration in this town wants to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=882.439s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I think that's a strong number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=885.826s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: There has, and it isn't, there just hasn't been any community outreach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=892.669s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And there was a meeting we were sitting in when they had just started talking about this and Kit Collins said, oh, if we could have knocked on every door in the Salem Street area, I would have wanted to talk to every neighbor and hear what they had to say and whether they were behind this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=912.117s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Well, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=914.871s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: put that in an RFP then and have this Innis company, if they're the be all end all to community design and planning, they should be doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=926.215s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Put that in the RFP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=927.335s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: That is your job to take care of the people in this area of your city and make sure that they are heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=937.908s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: The one thing that they're overlooking is that we are an environmental justice neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=945.493s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And that means, and this was put in the letter from our attorney at Richmond APC, and that is we are a racially diverse neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=956.22s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We are an economically diverse neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=959.622s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We are a multilingual neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=962.624s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And no notice or community outreach has been done in English<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=966.967s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: let alone other languages for those that don't speak English.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=972.151s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And that's not right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=973.892s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And this Salem Street rezoning has been in place since, I believe, July of last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=981.217s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And the residents are just learning about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=983.799s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And I find that crazy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=985.52s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And the first community engagement didn't happen until after they received our letter from the law firm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=994.507s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So that tells you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=996.568s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: that all of the people that raised concerns, many people say, oh, we brought it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1001.51s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We wrote a letter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1002.811s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We called the Community Development Board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1005.152s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: No action was going to be done until they got that our environmentally justice neighborhood is unhappy and the people need to be represented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1015.836s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So I think at the end of the day, we can all agree<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1019.818s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Salem needs a little facelift.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1021.36s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: It needs some love, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1023.924s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: But they have not followed processes set forth in their own procedures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1029.8s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: They haven't done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1030.86s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Therefore, by law, if you haven't notified abutters and if you haven't had community engagement, and it's not just one community engagement, one time at the elementary school, six months, seven months after you've already started the process, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1048.588s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: They have to go all the way back and start over from the beginning, and that is what we intend to make them do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1057.572s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: There have been no traffic studies, no studies on the effect to the school enrollments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1063.655s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: How is that going to affect it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1066.037s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: No studies for safety, just our own safety in the neighborhood around fire and police.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1072.08s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: They're saying you can go four to six stories high and with eight foot between the buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1078.08s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Now, does that make common sense?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1080.223s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Our streets are old.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1081.385s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We are an older neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1083.367s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Very narrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1084.329s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Sometimes if, on my street, if you have two cars parked on either side, the fire truck really has to finagle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1091.499s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And I'm like, I hope that guy's a good driver.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1097.125s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1097.825s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And there are just so many other problems around Salem Street area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1104.25s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We are fortunate enough to have a trained engineer working with us, and we found out many, many things that need to take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1116.098s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: are not, and so we are bringing those all up together, and there will probably be another legal letter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1123.326s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: But ultimately, we are interviewing attorneys for a class-action lawsuit regarding the Salem Street lack of process as defined by the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1132.996s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: It constitutes, from a couple of attorneys, a taking of land, if you will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1139.042s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And ultimately, above all other items, there's discrimination, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1143.524s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We are an environmental justice neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1146.325s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We have certain rights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1147.525s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: This isn't taking place in West Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1149.566s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Why is that, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1150.546s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Why is nothing like this taking?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1152.887s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So that is discrimination, and we intend, you know, to see where that can go, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1210.018s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Yeah, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1212.78s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So that's really a loaded question, because there is so much going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1218.805s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We could be here just for its own show, just on that, what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1223.489s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: But I do know that there is a 10-story dorm going in with Tufts in South Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1232.176s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: The neighbors were very upset about that, and rightfully so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1234.897s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: There's going to be 670-some people in that dorm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1238.858s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And as one of the neighbors said, I don't want 670 people staring at me when I'm in my backyard on a Saturday or Sunday morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1249.32s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And that's not even the biggest part of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1251.0s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: The biggest part of it is they're losing sunlight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1253.741s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We already in New England don't have a lot of sunlight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1256.402s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: There's sunlight studies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1258.722s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: seem questionable at best, if you will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1262.427s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And, you know, so that's an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1264.89s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: In fact, they are using our same attorney at Richmond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1269.375s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Those people in that neighborhood have banned together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1272.819s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Mystic Avenue is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1275.202s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: In the process of being rezoned, I hear 20 stories on the side that's near the water, which is crazy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1282.531s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: You know, they want to put in all of this communal living and all of these dorms and all of this, and it's not really the neighborhood environment that people and that the homeowners, the taxpayers and the voters want to live in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1296.327s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: There's St.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1296.948s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Clair going up where we don't even know really what's going in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1300.512s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: It's supposed to be, it was originally supposed to be a domestic violence shelter then, but they referred to it in their business plan as recidivism, so recidivism and domestic violence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1314.67s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: domestic violence victims shouldn't really be used in the same sentence, in my opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1320.415s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So there's a lot going on there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1322.517s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: But again, all of these projects are going on all at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1327.481s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And this, again, speaks to my point where the city lacks the experience and this administration lacks the experience because there isn't a business out there unless they are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1339.098s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: a staunch, sophisticated business that has done this for years and learned their lessons and made their mistakes and learned that would do this many projects at once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1349.263s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And so I would say, let's pick one project, do that one project, do it well, experience it, learn from a few mistakes, and then move on to the second project, not six projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1363.769s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I hear you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1364.37s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1448.509s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Well, I think that's the driving force behind all of these projects taking place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1455.135s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I think that that's a great question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1458.277s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And I think most people living in Medford would say, when you look around and you drive around, not much, not a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1466.044s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And it's as if the administration has had this epiphany that, oh my gosh, we've been in office X amount of years, and we haven't really done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1475.749s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: People are still complaining about the streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1477.831s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: There's still lead in the water.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1479.231s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: There's still problems at the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1481.253s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And so they're trying now to overcompensate for that because there's another election coming up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1489.377s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: You know, the roads are awful and the schools are not being run efficiently, to your point, and the list just goes on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1494.92s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: There's still no city solicitor, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1498.062s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Why can't that be fixed in three years?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1500.463s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And there's nothing but lawsuits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1503.185s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Nothing but lawsuits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1504.445s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And as someone that's, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1507.667s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: run a business and run profit centers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1510.388s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: If you're getting sued that often, someone should be figuring out why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1516.009s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: You need to be having conversations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1517.909s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Who's getting all of the lawsuits?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1520.029s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Is it one specific department?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1522.01s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Is it one specific manager?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1524.21s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Is it a group?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1526.091s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Where is it coming from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1527.551s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And what is the impetus to that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1530.551s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And how do we stop it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1531.912s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: How do we quell that from happening?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1533.932s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: But, you know, what they have accomplished is they've increased taxes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1539.695s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: They've offered to give themselves salary increases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1543.516s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: There's complete chaos in every single neighborhood except West Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1548.018s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Isn't that interesting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1550.099s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And I just think that there's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1554.621s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: a lot of reasons for many homeowners, taxpayers, voters, and citizens to have concern, a lot of concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1570.11s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I think people... They're starting to... And you know, that's the good thing, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1574.933s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We were all very sleepy and I used to say, oh, ignorance was blessed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1579.176s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: When I didn't know any of this stuff was going on, it was great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1582.719s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Now my whole life is consumed with it when I'm not at work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1587.422s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So, I think, and this is the benefit, they have woken up tens of thousands of people, taxpayers and voters, that are really ticked off and fed up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1602.814s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I hear it day in and day out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1619.748s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I love Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1621.049s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I bought my home here in 2013, and I've lived here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1624.432s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I love being in a diverse neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1627.555s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I love its location to Cambridge, and you can be in and out of Boston very quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1634.881s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: But it's not going to get better in Medford and keep the neighborhood feel until<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1642.547s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: there's a change at the next election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1644.829s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I mean, that has to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1647.511s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And there are certain things that we need desperately to happen that this administration just will not allow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1656.838s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And one of the things is an audit, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1658.54s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And we had asked<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1660.321s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Can we have an audit?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1661.603s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Can we vote on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1663.004s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And unfortunately, it's Massachusetts state law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1665.968s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: It's the only state in the country that in order for a municipality to pull an audit, you need to have all 100% vote by the city council and the mayor has to agree to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1679.904s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So, and it isn't that there's any necessarily wrongdoing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1684.325s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: It's just that what we see even in business is dealing with the same vendors, if you will, which is what an audit firm is, they get a little complacent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1695.389s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: and don't look as hard as they should.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1697.31s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And then what can we ask for from them, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1700.012s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We don't get line items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1701.433s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We should have line items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1703.274s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Was that department, so without having line items for departments with specific expenses, you have the ability to move funds around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1711.98s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Not that there's anything necessarily wrong with that, as long as at the end of the day your dollars and cents balance out and you know technically where everything is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1721.867s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: But the perfect example of not having a line item is they left $9 million in a checking account for a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1728.013s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And they said, oops, we found a checking account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1730.636s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: How do you leave $9 million in a checking account in an interest rate environment that hasn't existed in decades?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1740.145s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1740.726s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And so $9 million at a 5% interest rate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1746.109s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: 100% collateralized, because you would never take a risk with public funds, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1750.655s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Lost us $450,000 in one year, and if it had been there for two years, well, let's do the math, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1756.864s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: That's a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1758.707s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: But again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1760.85s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: You don't know that because you don't have line items, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1763.292s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: When you have line items, you know every single penny, where it is, and you list all of the financial institutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1770.197s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And we need to have an ethics committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1773.36s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I feel really very, very strong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1775.822s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: The state has an ethics committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1778.064s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We can model it after what the state does for an ethics committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1783.848s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: and set the rules of the road that everyone has to adhere to, whether you're a developer in the city, whether you're a business owner, whether you're a taxpayer, whether you're a city councilor, whether you're the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1796.398s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Let's say here's the line in the sand, and this is where we don't go over it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1801.823s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And it has to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1805.365s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: It just has to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1807.511s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And if not, my concern and my fear is that this administration is on the way to bankrupting the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1818.757s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: That's my greatest fear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1824.7s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I mean, how many lawsuits can you take?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1827.081s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Especially if we start a class action and especially if we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1830.083s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I mean, you have 947, 980 people in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1835.703s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And a class action lawsuit, that's going to be expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1858.627s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Right, right, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1860.267s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: They didn't want to spend the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1861.608s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: They don't want to spend the money on that, but they'll spend the money on the lawsuits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1864.469s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: They don't want to spend the money on hiring the right planning company that's going to do an RFP that's going to include going out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1873.732s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: their comment to us when we said, well, you haven't even done traffic studies on Salem Street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1877.733s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Their comment to us is, well, when the businesses come in, they'll do their traffic study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1882.474s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: When what they want to build comes into play, why do we have to do 10 different traffic studies that we, you know, we do one traffic study, then you know where you go, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1895.377s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And they do it a little bit backwards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1896.818s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: It's almost like you need to run the city with a business plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1900.339s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: What do we need for money and where are we going to get it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1904.1s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And how are we going to divide that money up that we want to get between the homeowners and the taxpayers and the businesses and the new businesses coming in and how can we attract people here that are going to help that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/x-wCLjtQBdU&t=1924.841s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5205.574s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Patricia Ciappelli.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5208.099s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: 53 Garfield Avenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5209.22s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I just wanted to make sure that the Community Development Board got our legal letter from a group of neighbors this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5217.589s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We have 837 people that have voted no for this corridor expansion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5224.357s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: No one has been included in any community involvement questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5230.723s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: All we hear is, we think you need, we've decided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5235.287s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: What about the voters and the taxpayers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5237.368s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I feel confident in the next week, we will have over a thousand people in this neighborhood that do not want this corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5245.275s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: This is a social justice neighborhood, as our legal letter imply, who have done nothing to offer any kind of, there's language barriers, nothing has been done in another language, nothing has been done regarding a reverse 911 call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5265.137s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And I think it's despicable the way this has been hidden from the neighbors and the constituents in this neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5272.642s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Salem Street, if you would even bother to come over here at six o'clock in the morning and six o'clock at night, you would see bumper to bumper traffic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5283.048s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And I think this is all of this rezoning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5285.589s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: It is just too much, too fast, too big, too dense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5291.032s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: It is not what this neighborhood needs and nothing that the voters, the homeowners and the taxpayers want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5298.777s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And we all know that, you know, you have to do something to expand some of the living.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5306.181s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: But this is ridiculous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5307.681s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: It's not taking into concern the neighborhood at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=5311.706s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And we are prepared to take legal action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZQDZZh_VfdI&t=11760.734s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I think it's important to note that the residents, the voters, the taxpayers, the homeowners that have made this neighborhood are against this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZQDZZh_VfdI&t=11770.202s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: They have rights just as everyone else does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZQDZZh_VfdI&t=11773.425s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And we are ready to appeal this and fight this in court however we have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZQDZZh_VfdI&t=11781.992s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZTCR91cjd8&t=9836.691s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Hi, I'm at 53 Garfield Avenue in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZTCR91cjd8&t=9841.375s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And I just want to say that, you know, if you do your research on the owners of the building, and some of the president of the yellow house, you will find some questionable dealings listed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZTCR91cjd8&t=9853.319s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And I think that as the Community Development Board and the city, you owe it to us residents to do your due diligence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZTCR91cjd8&t=9861.166s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I think we're tired of being told what we're going to live with when we're the taxpayers and homeowners in this area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZTCR91cjd8&t=9867.712s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We have voting rights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZTCR91cjd8&t=9869.154s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We have the ability to live in an environment that we wish.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZTCR91cjd8&t=9873.422s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And as someone that grew up in a home with domestic violence, to say that you're gonna take someone that is a domestic violent person and leave them in the same city where their abuser is, is absolutely crazy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZTCR91cjd8&t=9886.987s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: That means you know nothing about the industry at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZTCR91cjd8&t=9889.908s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And if that is the case, then they will be sought after because the abusers do not walk away without coming after what they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZTCR91cjd8&t=9897.791s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So I suggest you rethink and you reconsider before you approve this, because this is not the place to have the violence in this neighborhood with the taxpayers and the homeowners trying to raise their own children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/fZTCR91cjd8&t=9912.559s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8882.872s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Patricia Ciappelli, 53 Garfield.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8886.833s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So one of the comments was last to the table, and I would say that's about right for Medford because nowhere did we apply for any road grants, which the federal government granted to Everett.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8897.947s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: They granted it to Somerville, and Springfield got $15 million in road grants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8903.47s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So what are we doing about that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8905.411s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Grants for the water and sewer are up and available now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8908.253s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: What are we doing about that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8909.334s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Yet we're told, oh, you have to come up with the $200 million for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8912.636s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: $9 million sat in a checking account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8917.515s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: In the highest interest rate times, in something conservative with a decent interest rate, you lost us $450,000 in one year's time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8927.285s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: How long?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8927.765s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: In two years?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8928.906s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: You tell me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8930.067s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So we still haven't learned our lesson because I chased down Ted to say, why am I on the DLS website and it's showing me something different for the rate that our taxes would be coming up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8941.318s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: And he said, oh, you added in the fire station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8945.062s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I said, well, of course I did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8946.623s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: That's coming up next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8948.305s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So people need to plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8950.046s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So again, we haven't planned like we should three years, five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8953.83s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We're just looking one year ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8955.331s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: What do we need for one year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8957.173s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: When the fact is, people who live on budgets actually do have to plan three and five years ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8966.701s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We can only do expenses we can afford, but we can do an electric street sweeper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kP4iRYobyr0&t=8971.845s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: So my question to you is, why would I trust this administration with another dime of my money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6934.38s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Patricia Ciapelli, 53 Garfield Avenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6937.862s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: As an abutter to the methadone dosing facility at the end of my street, I was never notified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6943.807s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: There's a reason why legal notices are to be sent certified mail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6948.65s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Then imagine my surprise when I find out this firm is the same firm that has wreaked havoc in Lynn, Springfield, Lowell, and Boston, Mass and Cass, where people defecate and urinate in the streets, and the engagement center had to be closed because the employees were afraid to go to work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6963.973s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We have gathered hundreds of voters' signatures, hundreds, over the past few weeks against this facility coming to our neighborhood, and we will continue to gather more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6975.056s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: People from North Medford, West Medford, Brooks, Lawrence Estates area, when we asked them, why are you signing our petition?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6982.979s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: This doesn't affect you or your neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6985.359s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: They responded, it's Medford, and we've heard about this company.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6988.88s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We don't want them in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6991.448s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We already assist those afflicted with this horrible disease.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6994.87s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We have 10 locations within two miles of just downtown Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=6999.974s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: You recently asked for a 2.5% override for our taxes to fund the schools for additional programs because you care about our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7007.839s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Do you really?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7008.499s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Does putting a methadone dosing facility 0.2 miles from an elementary school speak to your care for the children?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7015.564s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Or is prostitution and walking through needles on the street to get to school a new program of education you are offering?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7022.289s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: I can't believe you let Habit Opco be in charge of their own traffic study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7027.033s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: This is a horrible way to run the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7029.015s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We trust you to provide a checks and balances on how you produce your business and how you make your decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7036.381s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: You are the equivalent of a publicly held company and we are your stakeholders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7041.606s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: You owe us the complete transparency on information and financing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7047.131s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Recently, the Administration for Children and Families, a division of Health and Human Services, recently held a human trafficking and the opioid crisis webinar conference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7056.959s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Dr. Catherine Chong stated, there is an intersection where opioid users and human trafficking cross.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7064.585s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We have learned that human traffickers are increasingly recruiting in drug rehabilitation facilities and other similar programs because they see the vulnerability when someone is trying to recover from opioid or substance use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7078.356s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: They are also focusing on the parents that come to those facilities and exploit their children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7085.202s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: How do we know this would stop here, given the close proximity to any neighborhood or elementary school where they want to come back?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7093.171s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: The Glenwood area has received your message loud and clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7096.033s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: We are a racially, ethnically, and economically diverse neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7099.495s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: It is clear you are blatantly discriminating against us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7102.977s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: You may be the Our Revolution, but we are the Take Back Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/6nDWJcu6tF4&t=7107.059s">[Trish Schiapelli]</a>: Nice to meet you.<br><br>
