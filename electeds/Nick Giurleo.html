 <p>[Nick Giurleo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=60.416s">Hi,</a> John, thanks for having me.
 <p>[Nick Giurleo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=119.195s">I</a> think you're right, John, that this certainly is the talk of the city at the moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=123.157s">So</a> this is, in my opinion, a very critical election issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=127.619s">Who</a> we decide to be in the council will influence our zoning going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=131.942s">So</a> first I'll just talk about, for anyone who might not know, just a summary of what is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=138.045s">So</a> currently on the table is a proposal to comprehensively rezone the residential neighborhoods in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=145.429s">Under</a> this proposal, they'd be creating five new sub-districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=148.873s">and</a> essentially everyone would be getting up zoned. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=152.436s">The</a> idea behind this is to try to create a larger housing supply under the belief that more housing will result in affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=162.746s">So</a> this proposal, we'll see upwards of six units as of right in neighborhoods, historically zoned to be single family. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=173.387s">And</a> the zoning, it's really been under the radar for a while, but it really came to public attention recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=180.869s">People</a> are very concerned, very concerned about the dramatic impact that density increases will have on our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=187.93s">Some</a> opposition groups formed and there was major public backlash at a meeting of the Community Development Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=193.431s">And</a> this actually prompted the mayor to intervene and essentially say that <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=198.828s">she'd</a> be refusing to extend the contract with the city's zoning consultant unless the proposal was scrapped. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=206.212s">Council</a> President Bears responded, essentially punted the issue and says, we'll take up residential rezoning in the spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=215.176s">So</a> to me, this is obviously his attempt to try to see what will happen with the election, which is why I said at the beginning, this is really an election issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=224.917s">I</a> think we're seeing with the council this kind of concept of, well, we know it's best for you, as opposed to, well, let's ask neighbors what they want and what they want their neighborhoods to look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=234.164s">So</a> my position has really been, we need to do what neighbors want. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=236.986s">We</a> need neighbors to have a say in what their communities look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=241.01s">So</a> I'm opposed to the plan on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=243.291s">I</a> think it should be totally scrapped. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=245.473s">And</a> if I'm elected, I'll vote no on it, if it comes up before me. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=250.278s">And</a> ultimately, there's been a lot of process concerns, process issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=253.261s">This</a> process needs to reflect what the majority of our neighbors want. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=257.626s">Not</a> what consultants say we need, not what academics say we need, not what activists say we need, but we need to talk to ordinary people. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=265.143s">They</a> should have a say in what their neighborhoods look like because they're the ones living there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=268.645s">I</a> think that makes perfect sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=270.307s">I</a> think it's very common sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=272.688s">For</a> me, you know, particularly, I also want to see studies too about, you know, if the zoning is approved, how will services be impacted? <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=280.734s">How</a> will our fire be impacted? <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=282.175s">How</a> will our police, our infrastructure, our schools, which are already overcrowded, <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=287.89s">And</a> we've seen it, you know, with the council, just this unwillingness to listen. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=291.832s">I</a> can point to specifically the Salem Street corridor, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=296.434s">The</a> CDB recommendation for one of the critical nodes of that, the Salem and Park Street node, it resulted in this sub-district designation that would have allowed up to six stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=307.879s">And</a> currently that's what's in effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=310.06s">So</a> there's efforts now to try to reverse that, but we're seeing, you know, this just unwillingness to listen. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=316.142s">And</a> it's very concerning to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=318.93s">So,</a> you know, I want to and I'll put out there, you know, I think it's okay to make reasonable revisions to our zoning ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=324.812s">I</a> would just like to make sure that those changes are what neighbors want and ultimately don't result in excessive density, overcrowding, overdevelopment. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=334.556s">I</a> think we'd be better spending our time more focusing on the commercial side of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=338.347s">To</a> me, we need to be preserving, not only preserving our commercial tax base, but expanding it to encouraging businesses to come to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=344.869s">And</a> I think reasonable zoning changes could achieve that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=348.871s">But</a> I guess in summary, again, not in favor of the proposal currently on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=353.433s">And</a> I definitely wanna make sure that when I'm elected, I'm listening to what residents have to say, giving them a voice, and ultimately making sure that they feel heard.
 <p>[Nick Giurleo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=499.395s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=499.595s">So</a> yeah, like the zoning, it's another big issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=501.616s">And</a> it will be on the ballot in November. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=505.057s">So</a> voters will have to decide whether or not they approve or they reject this thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=509.818s">So</a> first, I'll just back up a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=511.179s">You</a> know, what is a charter for anyone who might not know? <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=513.84s">Essentially,</a> it's the Constitution for our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=515.98s">It's</a> the governing document that tells us how our city is organized in terms of a mayor, <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=521.9s">a</a> school committee, and a city council, as well as all our departments, and boards, and commissions, and administrative agencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=529.744s">So</a> Medford's currently under what is called a plan A form of government. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=533.426s">There's</a> a provision in the Massachusetts General Law, this chapter 43, gives some general rules on charters, and then gives cities an option to choose between various plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=545.212s">So</a> in 1986, Medford voters <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=549.403s">moved</a> us from a plan E to a plan A. And now in November, voters will decide whether we transition again away from a plan A to this kind of new charter that our charter committee has worked very hard to get together. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=566.433s">And</a> that leads me to the next thing here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=568.434s">So</a> charter review committee was established. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=571.876s">We</a> had some notables in our city who were on that, people like Ron Govino, Melvin McDonald, Eunice Bratton. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=578.284s">who</a> really worked hard to make sure that residents' input would be taken into consideration to prepare this document. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=583.87s">So</a> I applaud them and all their hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=586.853s">And</a> I appreciate all their patience too, you know, getting us to this point where we can finally have something to vote on. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=594.01s">So</a> it was, like I said, approved for the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=596.572s">So</a> the state legislator said, it's okay for our ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=598.914s">So</a> we'll be deciding on it in November. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=601.396s">And</a> there's various changes to it, but I think in our short time together, the number one thing to highlight would be it's moving us from a seven member at-large council now to an 11 member council with eight ward Councilors and three at-large Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=617.689s">And</a> we see a similar setup with the school committee <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=620.932s">So</a> for that, there'd be two at-large members and four from districts, districts being wards combined. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=628.614s">So</a> my position on the charter is I tend to vote yes on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=632.595s">I</a> think by no means it's perfect, but I certainly think it's an improvement from what we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=637.196s">And</a> I think it's important to remember that year that I said earlier, 1986 was the last time. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=643.96s">Medford's</a> charter has been changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=645.341s">This</a> is a considerable amount of time to not have changed your charter at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=650.302s">So</a> I do think, you know, one of the reasons I support this is because board representation, I think is gonna be a lot more representative than what we're currently doing under our at-large system. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=659.546s">It's</a> going to be giving a voice to those who've been very frustrated by the council's conduct as of late. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=665.968s">We</a> have people in our wards who haven't seen in a very long time <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=671.115s">anyone</a> on the council from their ward. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=673.717s">So</a> I think it's important that we make sure everyone in our city is being represented. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=677.999s">That's</a> one reason why I support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=679.54s">Another</a> thing I think it's important to put out there is that some of our current council members, actually almost all of them, were pushing for a district model for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=690.807s">So</a> like I said, kind of with the school committee, a district is essentially wards combined. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=695.57s">So</a> they held out really until the very end on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=699.512s">So</a> they were getting pushback from their own base. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=702.715s">And</a> to me, you know, this this reason why they were really pushing the district model, I think the only word we can use to describe it as gerrymandering, I think they were trying to gerrymander our city to try to make it more favorable for them and their base to win elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=717.167s">So</a> I think this word based system be a lot fairer. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=720.27s">That's</a> one of the reasons why. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=722.068s">I</a> support the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=723.229s">Another</a> thing is though, even if you're upset about it and you think it could be better, it does have provisions in there that would have us being periodically reviewing the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=733.953s">It's</a> part of the language. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=735.494s">And</a> I strongly encourage that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=737.895s">I</a> think under the current language is a review every 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=741.216s">I</a> think we should be doing that even more frequently. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=743.037s">I</a> mean, I think we should always have an open mind on making changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=746.498s">We</a> should try to make our government work as best as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=750.832s">So</a> that would be my take on the charter.
 <p>[Nick Giurleo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=805.763s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=806.223s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=806.664s">So</a> there'll be opportunities to change it if things aren't working. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=810.667s">And</a> we also just got to respect that hard work that the Charter Committee did in getting us to this point.
 <p>[Nick Giurleo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=875.351s">Thank</a> you so much, Sean. <a href="https://youtu.be/PIGC3TQVfE4&t=876.152s">Always</a> a pleasure.<h2><a href="../2025-10-01_L2PVZXRYAAI/2025-10-01_L2PVZXRYAAI.html">City Council 09-30-25</a></h2>
 <p>[Nick Giurleo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=2178.225s">Good</a> evening Nick Julio 40 Robinson Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=2180.806s">I</a> am in favor of this resolution and I thank Mr. Carney for bringing this issue to my attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=2186.289s">I</a> think it very much being the public interest to get some sort of update on why we're seeing this unequal treatment here doesn't really seem fair to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=2193.932s">And</a> I think regardless of whether or not there's a contract in place I think everyone would benefit, just at least from a little more information to kind of understand the rationale behind this so I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=2205.157s">Councilor</a> Leming for bringing this very local issue to the council's attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=2208.364s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nick Giurleo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=8167.377s">Good</a> evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=8168.398s">for</a> Robinson Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=8170.579s">I</a> strongly support this referral. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=8172.88s">I</a> think I like others don't believe the six story height maximum is appropriate all for the note and I think it's important to point out the same height maximum. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=8181.424s">It's</a> a commercial <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=8183.265s">I</a> know there are many neighbors who express concerns about that MX to designation early on so I applaud not only them for voicing their concerns but also for the Community Development Board for for listening and ultimately recommending that MX one designation so of course the Council does have discretion to accept or reject. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=8202.265s">recommendation</a> of the CDB but I think it's just a matter of principle. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=8206.227s">It</a> should be giving significant deference to those recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=8209.028s">So,</a> it's unfortunate that we're in this position where we have to essentially backtrack because the recommendation of the board was not taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=8216.571s">So,</a> strongly in favor of referral and I'm looking forward to speaking more substantively on this when that public hearing opens. <a href="https://youtu.be/L2PVZXRYAAI&t=8226.235s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-08-28_og30Vvr2J5c/2025-08-28_og30Vvr2J5c.html">Medford City Council Candidate Forum 2025</a></h2>
 <p>[Nick Giurleo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1534.343s">Hi,</a> everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1534.823s">I'm</a> Nick Giurleo. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1535.524s">Thank</a> you all for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1536.824s">Just</a> a little bit about my background. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1538.445s">I</a> grew up in Medford, lived here my whole life. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1541.187s">Went</a> to Medford High School, graduated number one in my class, and decided to stick around for college and ended up going to Tufts University. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1547.15s">Great</a> education there. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1548.971s">And</a> after that, I decided to work for a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1552.573s">I</a> ended up working here in the square, actually, for a law office. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1554.914s">Really</a> got interested in law through that experience, and decided I would go to law school. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1558.836s">So</a> I went to law school, ended up at BC Law. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1561.582s">Graduated</a> from BC Law, became an attorney, and that's what I do today. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1564.625s">I</a> work for a great firm in downtown Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1567.528s">Just</a> one little brief thing about here about why am I running, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1570.71s">Why</a> am I running? <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1571.751s">I'm</a> running because being civically involved is really important for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1575.115s">I</a> want to be involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1576.015s">It's</a> important to not complain when you have problems with what's going on in the city, but to take a step forward and do something about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1581.821s">So</a> I decided I needed to step forward and do something about the things that concern me. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1586.465s">So</a> two issues that I just want to talk to you about in my very brief time here. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1590.706s">Number</a> one, that's been central to my campaign, affordability. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1594.207s">Medford</a> is, as everyone probably knows, an increasingly unaffordable place to live. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1597.847s">Long-time</a> residents feel pressured out of their homes, and residents who want to move here feel like they can't because of barriers. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1604.049s">So</a> what can we do about that? <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1605.209s">In</a> my opinion, the main reason for unaffordability is just the burden that residents have. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1610.09s">in</a> meeting our spending needs, primarily through property taxes, which is where we get the majority of our revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1615.171s">I</a> think we can be smarter, though, and take that burden off them and shift it into areas like commercial, bringing businesses to Medford and also preserving our commercial tax base. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1623.413s">The</a> commercial tax rate is nearly double the residential, so we get significant revenue through that. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1629.455s">That's</a> one issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1631.35s">is</a> transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1632.671s">And</a> for me, that primarily means council accessibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1635.812s">So</a> allowing the city council to be a resource that everybody can use. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1639.573s">So</a> there's a lot of problems in terms of accessibility that we have to do something about. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1643.295s">Very</a> late running meetings, last minute agenda changes, getting very off topic often with the agenda items, as well as <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1651.938s">Reductions</a> in the public speaking time at the expense of hearing people's opinions. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1656.902s">So</a> I think we can do simple things like change the rules of our city council to make it more accessible. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1661.886s">And</a> also I'm interested in information too, public information. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1665.428s">Voters</a> should be informed, they have a right to be informed. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1668.09s">What</a> can we do to make public records more accessible to our citizens, honoring requests and making sure people don't feel left out, people don't feel that communications are lacking. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1678.238s">So</a> these are two issues central to my campaign. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1680.639s">Again,</a> I thank you all for being here, and I would very much appreciate your vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1683.6s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-08-06_cZff0fmztDw/2025-08-06_cZff0fmztDw.html">City Council 08-05-25</a></h2>
 <p>[Nick Giurleo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=6475.656s">Good</a> evening, Nick Giurleo, Forty Robinson Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=6478.758s">I'll</a> begin tonight with the positives. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=6481.279s">First,</a> I was happy to see that the ordinance was substantively revised, especially subsection D on the divesting from human rights abusers. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=6488.984s">I</a> think striking that word entity from the subsection, for example, was a very good edit as I think that word was a <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=6495.828s">contributor</a> to it being overbroad. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=6497.568s">And</a> I was also pleased to see that my concern as to how the treasurer would make the determination of which entities fall into this category of human rights abusers. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=6507.131s">I</a> was glad to see that that was addressed as well by adding a subsection to section 2-698. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=6512.152s">That,</a> as I understand, establishes a criteria in which the treasurer is to make determinations on which entities <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=6520.614s">are</a> abusing human rights, although I did hear tonight for the first time concerns about the partiality of that criteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=6526.022s">I</a> think that's something I will personally look into as well as something all of you perhaps should look into as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=6532.504s">So</a> overall, I'll say, I do think between the drafts ordinance was improved, but that doesn't mean I think that it's perfect or I think ready for a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=6541.307s">I</a> think now we have to really focus our attention on subsections A through C. I know in the past meetings, speakers discussed that at length. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=6549.189s">We</a> really didn't see any edits there, that I noticed. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=6552.73s">So</a> my concern, again, with this is, once again, overbreath. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=6555.492s">I</a> think those sanction categories are far too over-encompassing. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=6559.114s">And</a> I do think they could potentially lead to unintended consequences. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=6563.197s">So</a> for example, a company that might derive more than 15% of its revenue from the combustion distribution or extraction of fossil fuels, that might not be as nefarious as you might assume. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=6575.465s">A</a> reality with fossil fuels is they do power the world, whether you like that or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=6580.457s">We</a> don't want to be unintentionally harming workers who are employed in these industries, when they're working under contexts that aren't unethical. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=6588.886s">And</a> the same reason I think would apply for the defense industry or companies that might assist with the logistics of running jails and prisons I mean for example with a company that just simply surprise the jail or prison food, I mean with the divestment ordinance apply to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=6602.9s">You</a> know, many of these businesses I think are ethical, even if you might kind of have utopian ideas about the world we want to live in, without maybe prisons or war, or anything else kind of bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=6613.823s">So</a> overall I guess my suggestion here is I think we do need to refine further I don't think this ordinance is ready for a vote tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=6620.825s">So</a> I would hope that the Councilor who moved to approve for the first reading withdraw that motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=6626.667s">We</a> can continue this and continue to refine, continue to work on this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=6630.23s">I</a> do think it's feasible, and I think it's ideal to have some sort of ordinance like this, but let's try to put emotions aside and do this the right way. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=6637.455s">Let's</a> do this prudently, rationally, and prevent the city from getting sued because of some problem with the ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=6645.382s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nick Giurleo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21432.751s">Good</a> evening, Mr. Alejo, 40 Robinson Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21435.393s">So</a> the first thing I'll say is just the late hour here. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21437.955s">I</a> mean, it's 1 AM, public comment is opening. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21440.778s">This</a> paper is extremely substantive. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21443.04s">Like</a> this chamber should be packed. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21444.741s">And</a> I'm sure a lot of people wanted to speak about this tonight, but couldn't because of how much time we spent on the other paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21451.647s">I'll</a> try to just be as condensed as possible with my thoughts on this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21458.554s">First</a> of all, I'll start with the positive thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21460.315s">That</a> is, I do think it's a good thing to have these kind of press release statements on positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21464.959s">So</a> I appreciate that the council president did that in the form of a speech, and that the mayor released what could be called a press release, just basically saying where they're at. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21476.609s">I</a> think that's helpful for the public and following. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21478.67s">So</a> I would encourage putting things in writing so people can <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21482.287s">follow</a> what's going on because really developments are happening rather fast. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21486.228s">I</a> don't support extending the INIS contract unless conditions are met. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21491.009s">I</a> think it's before we even talk about that, you know, first we have to say, obviously, you know, this is coming as a result of a pretty big public backlash against changes when residents actually started to become informed about what was going to happen if these changes were approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21506.834s">So</a> it goes to show you that we can't assume a louder <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21512.642s">vocal</a> minority of activist residents are representative of what all residents think, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21519.024s">And</a> we have to also think about, yes, there were probably election concerns that got us to this point as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21524.986s">So</a> I think with the conditions that the mayor has put out there, I think generally they're pretty reasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21531.848s">But</a> I think the first and most important one has to be restarting this process, given the concerns that have been expressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21540.333s">And</a> I don't think the Community Development Board, based on the feedback it has received, could in good conscience possibly recommend to you the map in its current form for a final vote, just because of all the feedback criticizing it that has been received. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21556.607s">So</a> I would encourage all of you to work with the mayor, try to reach an agreement here, and hopefully it's not just a repackaging of what has been extensively criticized. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21566.134s">I</a> think it's important that all of you proceed in good faith here. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21569.682s">acknowledge</a> this desire not for dramatic density increases that harms the character of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21578.328s">You</a> know, people move to Medford because they don't want to live in a place like Somerville or Cambridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21583.552s">It's</a> not because they want a replica of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21586.454s">We</a> can address issues with housing demand without wiping out the reasons that Medford is a good place to live. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21593.539s">It</a> does offer this increasingly rare thing in the overpopulated world that we live in <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21598.583s">called</a> home ownership. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21600.825s">I</a> think this kind of do or die alarmism that we've been seeing from people who think we need the density at all costs, I don't think it's helping anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21607.891s">And</a> I think it's really ignoring this problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21610.433s">Affordable</a> housing is not a new one. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=21613.096s">This</a> burden is really being placed disproportionately.

 <p>[Nick Giurleo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=4029.591s">Good</a> evening, Nick Giurleo, 40 Robinson Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=4032.133s">So</a> obviously very happy that we're revisiting, you know, changing our zoning comprehensively, but I do have to count myself among those who think this process is moving too fast. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=4041.861s">And</a> it's not because we're, you know, not spending a lot of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=4045.183s">you</a> know, with various meetings, but this is just monumental changes, you know, inherently, they should be a slow process, it should be a slow process. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=4051.931s">I</a> know you didn't want to hear general comments about speed. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=4054.635s">So</a> I'll just discuss one thing in my short period of time here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=4058.199s">I</a> think my biggest concern, and it's been expressed by so many others, and it was expressed in part, I think, by the DPW, Commissioner Tite, <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=4064.727s">is</a> just the impact on services, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=4067.709s">Schools,</a> DPW, fire, EMS, police. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=4070.752s">And</a> as we heard from the DPW commissioner, you know, he can only really speak generally on the impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=4075.335s">He</a> doesn't have any information. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=4077.557s">So</a> that's why I think there'd really be benefit in getting studies done here that really give specifics on if population increases, you know, forecasting what that would have in terms of strain on our essential city services. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=4092.908s">So</a> really, <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=4093.989s">That,</a> I think, is the most compelling argument for slowing things down. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=4097.31s">So</a> I strongly support that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=4098.75s">And</a> I would just urge, I guess, finally here, all of you to really take your time with this and try to avoid political pressure from the council to rush forward recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=4108.253s">Because</a> of just the drastic impact of these changes, it's super important that you take your time and try to do this in as scientific a way as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/-nzz6eWSWpU&t=4116.815s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-06-24_rov34HMcKiU/2025-06-24_rov34HMcKiU.html">City Council 06-24-25</a></h2>
 <p>[Nick Giurleo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4639.318s">Good</a> evening, Mr. Alejo, Forty Robinson Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4642.32s">So</a> for members of the public who might not be following, this letter from the mayor is requesting an appropriation of $8 million from our free cash balance, so over-budgeted taxpayer dollars, from a balance total of over $20 million for capital improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4659.094s">And</a> as the letter indicates, this includes street and sidewalk improvements, Oak Grove Cemetery repairs, equipment and vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4667.584s">If</a> you recall, during the campaign to override Proposition 2 1⁄2 and raise our taxes, money was requested to fund the Department of Public Works. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4675.309s">I'll</a> quote from the ballot question that was approved, quote, general operations of the Department of Public Works, in parentheses, 500,000, including but not limited to additional staff for road and sidewalk infrastructure repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4688.617s">That</a> was question seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4690.663s">You</a> also have to recall that supporters of the yes vote, including some members of this council repeatedly dismissed that we could use free cash as a substitute for raising taxes but you have to look and see what's happening here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4702.135s">We're</a> using $8 million in free cash, that's what this comes down to, or at least putting it aside in a separate fund for that purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4709.842s">So</a> I just as rhetorically you know why, given the amount of free cash that we had. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4714.707s">that</a> the people of our city were told raising taxes for $500,000 DPW money was necessary, and that we did suffer apocalyptic funding shortages if we didn't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4726.013s">So</a> this isn't the first time though, that since the election, the free cash has been used to meet city funding needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4732.456s">At</a> a actually recent meeting I spoke at, the mayor requested 5 million from our free cash for HVAC repairs for the schools, another about 200,000 for security upgrades across the public schools as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4743.221s">And</a> that was approved by this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4745.502s">So</a> I view this in addition to what I discussed previously as just yet another vindication of that free cash argument. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4751.844s">I</a> think it's unfortunate <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4753.265s">taxpayers</a> have to suffer as a result. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4755.366s">So</a> we can only hope that voters aren't misled again. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4758.186s">And</a> what I think is a likely event, we see another override on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=4761.927s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nick Giurleo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7276.138s">Thank</a> you, Nick Giurleo, 40 Robinson Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7278.76s">So</a> it's very tempting for me to comment tonight on the substance of the case, but I won't. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7283.563s">And</a> I think there's a reason for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7284.884s">And</a> the reason is I personally believe that this holding of the United States Supreme Court doesn't have much to do with what this council is tasked with doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7292.629s">So</a> obviously SCOTUS rulings are binding on Medford, just like any municipality in the country, but this resolution really isn't about the applicability of the law as it might affect Medford and its people. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7302.616s">To</a> me, it seems more like <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7304.452s">a</a> political statement, essentially, we don't like the outcome and that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7307.976s">You</a> don't have to like the outcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7309.918s">But</a> I'm just wondering, you know how the legal rationale right and it is pretty technical. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7313.442s">It's</a> talking about scrutiny, which is a very complicated legal concept, you know how that has anything to do and of course is about a law in the state of Tennessee, you know how that has anything to do with what the city council <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7325.349s">is</a> supposed to be doing, you know, and to my knowledge, none of you are licensed attorneys and I don't see any indication this our new city solicitor contributed to this resolution in any way. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7335.383s">And</a> I just want to point out also that, you know, our city is facing a series of significant very local issues at the moment, like the zoning, as well as affordability, and really a host of other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7346.59s">We</a> had a talk tonight about a rat problem, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7349.692s">These</a> are very local Medford issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7353.434s">And</a> it's okay, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7354.375s">You</a> might think, you know, access to gender affirming healthcare is a local enough issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7358.818s">And</a> I probably don't disagree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7360.919s">But</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7361.557s">I</a> think just practically speaking, if you look at just how the Massachusetts legislators composed at the moment, I don't think there's any chance it's going to pass a law banning access to gender affirming health care. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7371.479s">So</a> it doesn't seem like what we're talking about today is super consequential. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7375.741s">So</a> respectfully, I'm just going to put it out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7377.941s">I</a> don't think this is worth our time. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7379.621s">I</a> think there's other things we should be addressing before we worry about national political issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/rov34HMcKiU&t=7385.083s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Nick Giurleo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=91.684s">So,</a> John, I was, I've lived my whole life in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=97.089s">I</a> grew up here from a hardworking family, Italian-American family. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=102.513s">I</a> went through the Medford public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=104.655s">I</a> attended the Brooks for elementary, then the McGlynn for middle, and then I went to Medford High. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=109.979s">At</a> Medford High, I really focused on academics, so I studied hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=115.124s">And</a> I was fortunate enough to graduate number one in my class. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=118.787s">After</a> that, I decided I would go on to college, so I attended Tufts University. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=124.532s">When</a> I was at Tufts, I studied history and I studied international relations. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=127.815s">I</a> also did a minor in Italian. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=130.597s">Graduated</a> from Tufts, magna cum laude. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=133.72s">and</a> then went on to attend law school at Boston College Law. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=137.486s">And</a> there I had really excellent professors and a really great course of study. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=143.095s">A</a> lot of it was focused on municipal law and zoning and land use. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=147.835s">I</a> also had some clinical experience, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=149.356s">I</a> worked for a while as a prosecutor with the Malden District Court. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=154.618s">And</a> after that, I graduated from law school, and I took the bar exam. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=158.4s">I</a> passed on the first go, and I became a lawyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=161.481s">And</a> that's essentially what I do today. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=164.523s">I've</a> worked in criminal law a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=167.064s">I</a> worked for a law office in Medford Square for a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=170.625s">And</a> today I'm with a law firm in downtown Boston on State Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=174.387s">It</a> does primarily medical malpractice in court all the time defending rather prosecuting cases for people who are injured by doctors.
 <p>[Nick Giurleo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=210.025s">It's</a> a good question. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=210.985s">I</a> feel like the people who are considering voting for me, they should get an explanation for that because I think it's important to understand why somebody is running for elected office. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=219.331s">So</a> it's hard to summarize it in a few words, but to say it in a few words, or at least attempt to, I would say it's because I really do care about Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=226.816s">I</a> love Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=227.417s">I've</a> lived here my whole life. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=229.198s">And</a> I want to do, I think, what's best for Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=232.04s">I'm</a> really just passionate about this community, and I feel like it has so much potential. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=235.944s">I</a> feel like a lot of it is untapped potential, so potential we could actualize. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=241.228s">So</a> that's a big part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=242.609s">And</a> also, I've just been unhappy, I would say, with the way things have been going with city leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=247.433s">And</a> I feel like we could be doing better. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=249.915s">And</a> I feel like I might have the qualifications to improve what's been going on in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=256.961s">qualifications</a> primarily I'd say for my education just the fact that I've done a lot of school and I'm a lawyer and I think being a member of any sort of elected body you need to have kind of skills like that that a lawyer might have so I'd say all of that overall has kind of motivated me to run and for me it's very important you know it's easy to complain and say I don't like the way things are going but then we complain we don't take action. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=281.677s">There</a> you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=282.738s">So</a> for me, I said to myself, it's time to stop complaining and time to do something about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=287.942s">So</a> that's why I'm throwing my hat in.
 <p>[Nick Giurleo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=316.847s">I</a> like what you said at the beginning, that there are a lot of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=318.948s">We</a> could sit here all day and talk, but obviously we can't do that, so let's just talk about, I think, what are the major issues, just like you asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=328.671s">For</a> me, I would say that the number one issue is probably affordability at the moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=333.713s">We're</a> seeing on the national level just an issue of cost of living. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=338.618s">It's</a> just becoming very expensive to live anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=341.341s">But</a> especially in suburban communities near big successful cities like Medford, it's just becoming really expensive to live in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=349.649s">And</a> I think there are various reasons why that's the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=353.032s">So</a> for me, I want to do something about the situation with <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=356.956s">affordability</a> in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=357.997s">I</a> feel like people are very worried and concerned, you know, how am I going to afford to stay in the home that I've lived in, you know, or my family's lived in, you know, for all our lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=366.206s">So</a> what can we do about that? <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=367.228s">How</a> can we make this city an affordable place to live? <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=371.392s">I</a> would say the next issue in terms of importance would probably be, and I think it's related to affordability, but economic growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=378.8s">We're</a> seeing a Medford, I think, that's stagnating a bit when it comes to economic development. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=384.927s">So</a> for me, this is something I want to address. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=387.87s">What</a> can we do to make our city more prosperous? <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=390.553s">What</a> can we do to make our city wealthier and a wealth that everybody can have a part in? <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=396.698s">So</a> what can we do to bring businesses to Medford, for example? <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=399.72s">What</a> can we do to promote growth? <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=402.361s">So</a> hopefully that's something I would be able to address if I were elected. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=406.343s">And</a> I would say, just maybe as a third one, just to kind of wrap up, what are the major issues here? <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=412.305s">I'd</a> probably say it's transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=415.188s">I</a> think we're seeing a significant problem with that currently. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=417.89s">I</a> think people feel left out. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=419.532s">People</a> feel like they don't understand what's happening at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=423.395s">People</a> feel worried about this, concerned, maybe angry, upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=427.619s">And</a> I feel like information has been hard to get in a lot of circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=431.342s">So</a> I think transparency needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=433.964s">I</a> think we need a Councilor who is going to address that.
 <p>[Nick Giurleo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=493.733s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=494.233s">So</a> for anyone who's following my speeches at city council or maybe read my op-ed in the Tufts Daily, it's no secret that I was very opposed to all three ballot questions that we were presented with in November. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=507.958s">So</a> I really kind of <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=510.593s">made</a> it a point to be outspoken about that because I was deeply concerned about what I was seeing. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=515.158s">So</a> for anyone maybe not familiar, I'll just briefly recap them. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=517.82s">There</a> were three. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=519.101s">The</a> first one was $3.5 million for schools and DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=523.105s">This</a> would be an override proposition, two and a half override. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=526.088s">This</a> is a state law that allows taxes to be raised over a certain cap. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=532.194s">in</a> a given fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=534.075s">Question</a> 7 was a $4 million one for schools, and then question 8 was slightly different. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=539.898s">It</a> was called a debt exclusion, essentially a bond, $30 million for a new fire station. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=545.721s">So</a> these were the three questions Medford voters had to decide upon for the next election. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=550.584s">So</a> the reason why I was opposed, I had various reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=554.286s">The</a> most important, I think, was just the burden this would have on residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=557.888s">This</a> would essentially be a massive tax hike that would really hurt people who are already struggling. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=564.012s">I</a> talked about affordability at the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=565.973s">This</a> was, I think, a major contributor to the affordability problems we're seeing today. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=571.896s">This</a> idea of any time we have a problem in the city, let's just raise taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=576.178s">That</a> more money thrown at a problem fixes it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=579.18s">which</a> I think there's misperceptions about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=582.441s">So</a> the tax impact was a big part of my opposition. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=587.082s">And</a> I also think there was a lot of kind of fear mongering that came behind putting these questions forward, what I call maybe scare tactics, that I don't think was supported by data at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=597.845s">I</a> can give you a specific example of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=599.646s">I</a> mean, there was talk of, you know, teacher salaries, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=603.047s">You</a> know, oh, you know, our teacher salaries won't be competitive, but according to the Department of Education data, Medford salaries for teachers are competitive compared to elsewhere in the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=613.43s">And</a> this is data anyone can look up. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=617.031s">There</a> was also just a vagueness, too, you know, in terms of what is this money going to be used for specifically. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=621.612s">We</a> got general categories, like schools, DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=624.893s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=625.874s">Fire</a> station, but specifically, you know, where was this money going to go? <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=629.156s">You</a> know, for me, I think for voters, you know, they should be entitled to know line item, in a line item manner, where money is going to go, specifically. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=639.002s">So</a> the fact that it was vague, you know, was another reason I felt like I couldn't support. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=642.565s">And</a> then another thing that just cannot be passed aside is just the free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=647.368s">that</a> we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=648.008s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=648.769s">Quite</a> a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=649.669s">Quite</a> a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=650.19s">It's</a> gone up since the election. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=651.59s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=652.671s">Funny</a> how that happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=653.551s">At</a> the time, we had about $25 million, according to the Department of Revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=659.235s">But</a> like I said, that's since gone up. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=661.176s">And</a> anyone who doesn't know what free cash is, obviously, it's not free. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=663.737s">It</a> does come from taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=664.958s">But</a> it's essentially over-budgeted money in a given fiscal year that goes into a reserve fund that we're able to use for a broader range of purposes once it's certified. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=674.655s">So</a> we heard a lot of talk during the override campaign, oh, we can't use free cash to meet, for example, school expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=684.042s">But</a> what did I see at a recent city council meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=687.024s">The</a> mayor requested $5 million to repair deficient HVAC and the roofs at the middle schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=693.068s">So</a> $5 million that could have been used and is going to be used to <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=697.991s">net</a> fund that. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=698.752s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=698.993s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=699.213s">And</a> then there was that same day there was another request for $200,000 for security upgrades across the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=705.08s">So</a> it really was misleading for people to say that free cash was just off the table completely. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=709.947s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=710.508s">I</a> hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=711.048s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=712.249s">And</a> then just kind of to wrap this up, I would say growth, right, was another alternative to raising taxes, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=719.777s">If</a> we're increasing the commercial tax base, for example, we're getting more revenue, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=724.782s">And</a> we can use that to meet funding shortages. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=727.444s">So</a> we ignored new growth as well as an alternative. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=731.328s">to</a> the overrides. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=735.211s">You</a> have to think also just of the diversity of our city, economic diversity of our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=739.154s">What</a> happens when taxes go up? <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=740.935s">Well,</a> it drives out lower income people. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=743.197s">It</a> essentially gentrifies the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=745.539s">So</a> if you're concerned about gentrification, supporting tax hikes doesn't solve that problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=752.124s">So</a> we have to think of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=753.105s">We</a> have to think of how lower-income, middle-income people are going to be affected by tax hikes. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=758.15s">Especially</a> people on fixed incomes, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=759.732s">You've</a> got to think of seniors who are really struggling and barely getting by in a lot of circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=765.058s">People</a> with disabilities, as well.
 <p>[Nick Giurleo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=817.857s">Yeah,</a> so another great question. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=820.478s">I'll</a> go back to what I said again earlier, this idea of untapped potential. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=825.359s">Medford</a> is a city that could be much better in a lot of ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=828.881s">It's</a> great now in a lot of respects, but there's so much more we could be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=833.462s">So</a> for anyone not familiar, recently it was announced that there will be a very big development project coming to Medford Square, essentially three city-owned lots that are going to be transformed, a combination of mixed-use retail and residential, and nobody's denying this is going to fundamentally transform the square in terms of the way it looks, in terms of the way it's structured, who's living there, who's doing business there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=855.448s">So,</a> I'd say it's quite early, this proposal was only announced very recently, so I think I would need more information to form a definite opinion yet on where I stand on the proposal itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=866.294s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=867.735s">But</a> before I talk about maybe the questions I have regarding that proposal, I'll first say I think it's super important that we all dial in on the need to revitalize Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=880.062s">As</a> a guy who's studied a lot of history, Medford Square in the past used to be a very different place. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=884.865s">And</a> I'm not talking like 100 years ago, and it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=886.926s">No,</a> you're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=887.706s">But</a> in decades past, it was a very different place. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=890.487s">It</a> was much more livelier and more of a kind of gathering spot for the people of our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=896.268s">But</a> now it's in very rough shape in a lot of respects. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=898.849s">And</a> there have been improvements, but not enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=901.81s">And</a> you have to look also, I always say this to people, you have to look at our neighboring squares and compare them to Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=908.1s">Think</a> of Davis Square, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=909.622s">Central</a> Square in Cambridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=911.285s">Harvard</a> Square in Cambridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=913.048s">Kendall.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=913.448s">I</a> could go on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=914.51s">Yes,</a> you can. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=915.291s">Do</a> all of these. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=916.91s">resemble</a> Medford Square? <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=917.831s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=918.151s">These</a> squares, you have a lot of traffic, a lot of activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=921.273s">They're</a> booming in a lot of respects. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=923.234s">But</a> then you look at Medford Square, where I know people who live the next town over, you know, who move here from other places, and don't even know there's such a thing as Medford Square, you know, because there's so few reasons in a lot of respects to go, because it's difficult to park. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=936.223s">The</a> traffic is horrendous sometimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=938.645s">So</a> what can we do to support our local businesses there? <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=941.107s">They're</a> awesome, they're great, I love spending my money there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=943.609s">I'd</a> much rather spend my money there than at the big brand name shops. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=947.292s">I</a> agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=948.513s">What</a> can we do to improve them, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=950.274s">Bring</a> traffic to them, business to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=953.817s">For</a> me, like I said, it's the parking and the traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=956.399s">I</a> think a lack of access by public transit's also an issue too. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=959.462s">Yes,</a> yep. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=960.282s">Right,</a> I think there's just bus routes at the moment, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=962.524s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=962.985s">What</a> are the other ways we can get people to the square? <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=965.587s">But</a> then I guess just turning to the proposal itself, <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=968.649s">Like</a> I said, I think it's still early to form a conclusive opinion on it, but there are questions that I have, and I'm just going to go through a few of them that I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=976.376s">For</a> example, referring to the business here, how will this proposal affect the businesses that are already there? <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=981.941s">That's</a> something to think about. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=983.863s">Parking,</a> of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=984.804s">We</a> always have to be thinking about parking with any project. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=986.866s">We</a> can't ignore parking, period. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=989.988s">And</a> then another important thing is, you know, if you look at the map, where is this going to be? <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=994.291s">This</a> is going to be right next to the senior center in Medford Square, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=998.014s">So</a> how is this going to impact the senior center? <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=999.755s">Is</a> it going to pose any safety concerns, for example? <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1003.238s">Accessibility</a> concerns to the senior center? <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1005.999s">So</a> seniors who regularly frequent the senior center, they're major stakeholders in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1011.243s">We</a> have to talk to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1012.004s">We</a> have to make sure their opinions are heard on this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1016.127s">And</a> then also, we just have to think, you know, how will it look? <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1018.069s">I</a> mean, the aesthetic impact, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1020.391s">You</a> got to think about how old these buildings are in Medford Square, you know, with this big, new, modern, towering structure, you know, fit with the buildings that are already there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1029.601s">Obviously,</a> when it comes to looks, we tend to put that lower in our list of priorities, but it's still something to think about. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1034.145s">We</a> want our community to be beautiful, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1036.992s">So</a> those are the questions I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1038.214s">Overall,</a> my suggestion to the people who are involved with this would be not to rush this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1043.44s">I</a> think we need to slow down and we need to get adequate community input. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1047.405s">One</a> of the things we need to do is not just take community input, but actually actively change our plans based on what people have to say.
 <p>[Nick Giurleo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1096.472s">any</a> solutions any anything you can offer for that absolutely and like i said at the beginning this is a major aspect of my campaign here is i want to prove transparency in our city okay and i'd say i've included among these people who do feel left out in a lot of ways i think it's something many of us share <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1114.062s">So</a> for me, I think we're seeing a lot of ways to try to reduce the ability of the public to participate, right, for the purposes of, I guess you could call it expediency, trying to rush things through and promote an agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1127.288s">But</a> we have to look at the ways, number one, in which public participation was being reduced. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1134.452s">So</a> I can give you some very specific examples of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1137.733s">We</a> saw a resolution <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1139.654s">uh...</a> last year to reduce the amount of time by several minutes in which people can participate in public comment at city council meetings uh... this is terrible right because it we're now in a position where people go up and they have to rush and say everything they have to say i think it's currently three minutes very very fast they often forget things and <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1160.901s">Sometimes</a> there's pressure from the president of the council to immediately wrap up once that three minutes is reached. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1168.407s">It's</a> not like he says, oh, you can have a little more time. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1172.01s">Most</a> of the time, that's what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1174.532s">We're</a> seeing also just the meetings, how late that they're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1177.515s">Many</a> of them are going far past midnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1180.377s">And</a> you think of people who have to work the next day. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1183.66s">Maybe</a> they have to go to school or take care of children. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1186.402s">There's</a> all these different reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1188.303s">why,</a> you know, a meeting running really late is not a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1192.625s">So</a> I think we have to look at ways we can try to make it so we don't have that problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1197.627s">But</a> we're also seeing some kind of procedural sneakiness, too, with, for example, sticking controversial things at the very end of the agenda so that we don't get to them until midnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1209.953s">I</a> mean, there was a resolution against anti-Semitism before the council recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1213.875s">We</a> didn't get to that until very, very late in the evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1216.818s">But</a> that's such a huge community issue, you know, it's something, why are we not considering that? <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1221.641s">In</a> any event, it was tabled, so no one had a chance to say anything about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1224.823s">I</a> remember that, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1227.085s">I</a> can remember also a recent meeting in which we were talking about the charter and the charter was on the agenda along with other things that merited time but weren't as pressing as getting the charter to Beacon Hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1240.923s">So</a> what ended up happening was one of the Councilors <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1244.968s">moved</a> to take it out of order and didn't even receive a second to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1249.951s">That's</a> just horrendous. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1250.752s">I</a> mean, if anyone doesn't know what that means, like a second, you're not saying you approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1254.955s">You're</a> just saying, you know, I'm willing to have the discussion on this now. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1259.338s">And</a> they wouldn't even do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1261.559s">This</a> is just horrendous, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1263.521s">And</a> then immediately after that, someone else proposed a motion to take something else out of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1268.366s">Sorry,</a> a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1270.327s">And</a> that was approved without question. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1272.549s">So</a> it's really just insane, a lot of the things that have been happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1277.714s">So</a> for me, I want to do things. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1279.796s">like</a> change the rules to allow the public more opportunities to participate and do something about these like midnight, 1 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1286.741s">meetings.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1287.602s">Everyone</a> should have a chance to come to these meetings and say what they think. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1293.327s">They</a> shouldn't have to wait hours and hours and hours to talk for three minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1296.549s">It's</a> just not right.
 <p>[Nick Giurleo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1332.803s">That</a> is the question, I would say. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1335.605s">It's</a> so easy to make promises, the hardest part is delivering on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1339.395s">This</a> is something I'm thinking about now. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1341.016s">You</a> know, if I'm fortunate enough to get elected, it's something I should be thinking about from day one. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1346.281s">How</a> am I going to make these things I want to change happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1349.804s">So</a> for me, I think the most important facet of it is listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1353.767s">Listening</a> to residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1354.868s">What</a> are residents thinking and feeling? <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1357.491s">And</a> not just pushing them to the side. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1359.412s">You</a> know, we have our opinions and beliefs, and we should definitely stick to our principles. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1363.196s">But</a> at the same time, <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1365.017s">As</a> an elected leader, we're not, there's some who say, you know, you're elected to make decisions, and that's not false. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1372.444s">But</a> as an elected representative, you are an agent of the people who vote you in. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1378.41s">You</a> know, I think of as being a lawyer, I mean, what's my job is to represent a client. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1382.934s">My</a> judgment's entrusted to make decisions for the client, especially legal decisions where there's a knowledge gap. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1388.299s">But</a> at the same time, I'm working for the client. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1390.92s">The</a> client isn't working for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1392.781s">And</a> the same thing is true with, I think, being elected representative is you have to do what the people want. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1397.023s">So</a> listening is a big part of making things happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1401.445s">And</a> then, of course, just common things like hard work, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1405.006s">It</a> requires hard work and not laziness. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1409.408s">Prudence,</a> you know, being smart and listening and learning, teaching, and it's always good to admit when you don't know something. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1415.293s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1415.873s">And</a> do the homework and research, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1417.695s">We</a> have a lot of, I think, elected leaders, not just in Medford, but everywhere, who say, you know, I know what to do, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1424.08s">You</a> know, they kind of jump to conclusions about things, and they don't take a step back and say, well, maybe I should reevaluate my own perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1430.925s">Maybe</a> it's wrong in certain respects. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1432.286s">What</a> can I do to make it better?
 <p>[Nick Giurleo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1465.617s">Yeah,</a> so I think there's kind of two ways to talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1469.18s">Number</a> one is like, literally, how do you get in touch with me, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1472.804s">I</a> live here in Medford, obviously, I like to go to events. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1475.647s">I</a> do have some social media pages for the campaigns. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1477.749s">I</a> have a Facebook, Nick Trelaya from Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1480.812s">I</a> also have an Instagram. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1483.034s">So</a> I've been posting regularly about what I've been doing and who I've been talking to on social media. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1490.379s">So</a> if you have social media, feel free to take a look. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1495.222s">Of</a> course, anyone who wants to just talk with me, feel free to just find me, reach out to me, give me a call, send me a text, ask to meet for coffee. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1503.388s">I'm</a> happy, honestly. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1505.289s">you</a> know, busy guy between what I do for a living and campaign activities, but I'm going to make time for everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1511.57s">Even</a> people who don't agree with me, I encourage us to have conversations, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1516.012s">Let's</a> talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1517.292s">Let's</a> try to iron out, you know, what we don't agree upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1520.773s">Because</a> that's how it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1521.653s">That's</a> how you get things done is you cooperate. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1524.093s">But</a> in terms of just the other kind of aspect of your question, I'd say is, you know, where can you find me? <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1528.194s">Like,</a> what do I like to do in Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1531.455s">I</a> love Medford, I honestly do, and that's why I'm running. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1534.236s">Number</a> one place you'd probably find me is probably the library, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1537.816s">I</a> love the Medford Public Library, all the services it provides, just the space it offers for people who are interested in learning, and I'm a guy who just loves to learn, I love to read. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1547.538s">So</a> I like to go there a lot, hang out in the local history room, look at the yearbooks, look at the old historical documents, and just learn about Medford and how great a city it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1559.12s">Also</a> love being outdoors, enjoying the many beautiful things that Medford has to offer, like the Fells, Brooks Estate, Mystic Lakes, Mystic River. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1566.522s">Always</a> like being outdoors. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1567.562s">You</a> want to go on a hike with me? <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1569.582s">Feel</a> free. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1569.983s">Let's</a> go on a hike. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1571.263s">Talk</a> politics and hike. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1572.623s">Or</a> just enjoy the beauty of nature.
 <p>[Nick Giurleo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1576.224s">And</a> then I can't not say also, I just love going to Medford businesses as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1580.365s">I</a> love going to the Square, having lunch there, brunch, wherever it is in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1586.766s">Just</a> love spending my money in my hometown.
 <p>[Nick Giurleo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1603.044s">Yeah,</a> we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1603.304s">We</a> know how to eat in this city.
 <p>[Nick Giurleo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LoB1uXiSLjg&t=1607.146s">Everybody</a> in this city, regardless of ethnic background, we know how to eat in Medford.

 <p>[Nick Giurleo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=4859.747s">Good</a> evening, Nick Giurleo, 40 Robinson Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=4862.468s">So</a> I just want to point out something that I noticed in looking at this resolution in comparison to the Sanctuary City Ordinance that we recently passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=4872.79s">So</a> I don't think the resolution is actually consistent with the ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=4876.37s">So</a> going to in the ordinance section 5105, there is a reporting requirement in there already. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=4883.692s">I'm</a> going to just read a little bit from it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=4885.673s">It</a> says beginning on the date of passage of this ordinance and every six months thereafter, Medford chief of police shall submit a report with the information detailed below in a de identified manner relating to the preceding six months to, and then it goes on to say, the Public Health and Community Safety Committee of the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=4904.725s">In</a> accordance with the provisions of the open meeting law and then it goes on the list specifically what is to be included in this report total number of ice detainers administrative warrants. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=4914.712s">Account</a> of each instance in which information was given to a federal immigration agency with the names of individuals redacted and so forth, so to me, it seems like. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=4926.885s">In</a> order to make the reporting requirement more frequent, what would need to be done is amend the ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=4932.95s">So</a> I don't think this resolution would be enforceable because, again, I think it's inconsistent with the ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=4938.794s">So</a> I think at a minimum, what you should do is at least talk to legal counsel about this to see if there's a conflict and if the ordinance does need to be amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=4950.042s">But</a> otherwise, I think more practically, I don't think this resolution is entirely necessary because there's already a reporting requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=4956.628s">So</a> I don't think it's necessary to pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=4958.429s">So</a> those are my thoughts. <a href="https://youtu.be/a519TYOBRJE&t=4959.93s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-04-29_J5UJin9pTwE/2025-04-29_J5UJin9pTwE.html">City Council 04-29-25</a></h2>
 <p>[Nick Giurleo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4422.96s">Good</a> evening Nick Giurleo, 40 Robinson Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4426.162s">So</a> for the members of the public who might not be following, Mayor's asking that money be appropriated from our free cash fund, essentially over budgeted money to pay for HVAC and roof work at the McGlynn and Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4438.63s">Mayor's</a> asking for $5 million to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4442.433s">Another</a> item on the agenda tonight, there's another letter from her asking for almost $200,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4448.422s">for</a> security upgrades across the public schools also coming from the free cash fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4455.466s">The</a> second letter says that the balance of free cash at our disposal is over $27.5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4461.27s">And</a> it says in that first letter that if we don't make this appropriation using our free cash, an additional almost $2 million per year would be added to the city budget for the next 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4473.667s">That</a> quote on our current free cash balance is even more than what the latest data available on the Department of Revenue's website indicates Medford has in certified free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4485.109s">We</a> heard repeatedly during the override campaign arguments against the use of free cash to help meet our school's financial needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4493.291s">We</a> were told it wasn't a feasible substitute for raising taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4498.652s">I</a> find it ironic that now we're <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4500.934s">almost</a> half a year out from that election that we're proposing to do exactly what was said we cannot do, and that is using free cash to meet school funding needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4510.497s">So</a> I acknowledge there's a little bit of nuance to the arguments. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4514.138s">Some</a> said it was possible to use free cash, but not for long-term needs, and that's fair enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4519.92s">But</a> when we look at things like what is being proposed here, so infrastructure improvements that are intended to last in the long-term, it's hard for me to grasp <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4530.01s">how</a> this wouldn't be an appropriation of free cash for long term school needs, which again we were told we could not do. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5UJin9pTwE&t=4536.82s">That</a> is all I have to say thank you.<h2><a href="../2025-04-09_4-jeNb9kYhc/2025-04-09_4-jeNb9kYhc.html">City Council Meeting 04-08-25</a></h2>

 <p>[Nick Giurleo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5389.668s">Hello</a> again, Nick Traleo, Forty Robinson Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5393.051s">Um</a> I'd like to first just reiterate what I said in the earlier discussion about, you know, taking this resolution over resolution of the city charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5402.477s">Again,</a> concerning to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5405.107s">But</a> in terms of what happened to miss us Turk, I just like to offer a legal perspective given the lawyer and this is what I do for a living is think about legal problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5414.439s">I</a> think the issue is very narrow, to be honest with you, you know, because I think the legal questions really does a visa recipient. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5421.287s">have</a> that same right to freedom of speech as a citizen of the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5424.969s">And</a> I'm not here to answer that question I mean it would require a great deal of research to try to understand what the law says on that subject. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5432.732s">Ultimately,</a> I think it's a question that judges have to decide and that's what's happening right it's being litigated in the federal court. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5440.354s">So</a> I think when we use inflammatory language, really on either side, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5445.177s">Screaming</a> about deportation or screaming about political imprisonment, it really doesn't help address this problem, which is to try to resolve a legal question. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5455.005s">Another</a> thing I'd like to just point out is I think this is a little bit beyond the scope of what the city council is tasked with doing, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5462.75s">We're</a> talking about federal immigration law here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5464.992s">I</a> think every one of you would admit you don't have any jurisdiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5467.714s">to</a> handle that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5468.956s">Um</a> so, you know, ultimately, if you're not happy with what happened with miss Oster, you do have a right to be upset about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5474.822s">You</a> do have a right to petition your elected representatives in Congress. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5478.966s">Um</a> but you know, let's try to respect what authority this city council has to actually do things. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=5484.952s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nick Giurleo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7412.691s">Nick</a> Trillio again, Forty Robinson Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7415.233s">So,</a> you know, the premise of this is actually great, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7419.055s">Informing</a> people of their rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7420.336s">I</a> mean, when I do my job of defending people accused of crimes, I mean, that's something I encourage, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7424.939s">Know</a> your rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7425.559s">It's</a> important. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7427.06s">Everybody</a> wants that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7427.981s">You</a> know, it's just the issue with supporting a lot of these resolutions is hard just because of a lot of like the inflammatory language that gets put into them. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7434.808s">that</a> kind of politicizes the issue right like the issue at core here is like we should inform people of their rights, which is great, but then you have things like making blanket statements that, you know, federal law enforcement are like. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7447.602s">disproportionately</a> targeting non-white people, you know, when that's not really supported by any evidence that I've seen, you know, to me, that just unnecessarily politicizes these decent ideas behind the resolutions and makes it hard to support them. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7460.726s">So</a> I think if we can just get proposals out there that just get to the issues and avoid all the political fluff, we're going to actually accomplish more. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7468.408s">And</a> we're going to realize we actually agree on more than we think we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=7471.75s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Nick Giurleo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=14676.972s">Nick</a> Julio 40 Robinson road. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=14680.727s">I'll</a> try to be brief but basically my point is I think it's very important that the council remember the last step in this process right the last step of getting this done and that is it goes to the people, the people are voting on the charter, right, so we wouldn't want to go through a process in which we finally get to the last stage of it, and then we get some sort of tragic outcome of the people reject the charter, because they feel like it doesn't reflect <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=14706.68s">what</a> they had believed over time it should contain. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=14711.063s">So</a> that's why it's very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=14712.464s">I</a> think the overarching consideration here should be, what do the people want? <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=14717.748s">So</a> it's important to put individual opinions and egos aside and look to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=14722.791s">So</a> when it comes to ward versus district, when it comes to mayor on a school committee, we have to overall defer to what the people want. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=14733.679s">And</a> when we have, <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=14735.08s">Procedural</a> issues like what we're going through now with the amendments, but also the fact that we didn't get the public comment until 1030 because we took other items up on the agenda first, despite the importance of this item, it really does diminish the ability of the council to understand what the people actually want, which will get us to that goal of getting a charter through. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=14755.791s">So</a> I would just encourage all of you to really take that into mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/4-jeNb9kYhc&t=14759.753s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-04_l8nn1rt7aY0/2025-03-04_l8nn1rt7aY0.html">City Council Committee of the Whole 03-04-25</a></h2>
 <p>[Nick Giurleo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=8792.716s">Victor</a> Leo, 40 Robinson Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=8795.492s">So</a> with my comment I would just like to take a step back here and just remind the Council of kind of what is the overall goal of this process of getting charter out to the people to decide on. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=8805.282s">To</a> me, it seems like one of the major objectives here is we need a charter that makes our local government accessible to the people of our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=8813.39s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=8813.871s">So</a> I think it's just a matter of common sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=8815.672s">I'm</a> not really going to advocate strongly for one of these systems or the other in this comment, but I think just as a matter of common sense, I lean kind of more towards the word based system as representing this way of getting people <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=8830.365s">directly</a> to their elected representatives so they can feel themselves heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=8834.989s">But</a> kind of focusing on this process, you know, I would say that it really does seem like we're really speeding through it here. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=8841.455s">Like,</a> I understand the charter review process has been going on for a while, but it really does seem like we're trying to make an extremely consequential decision that will dramatically impact our city at a very fast speed. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=8853.625s">So</a> I think there would be value in potentially slowing things down <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=8857.329s">and</a> talking more to the people to try to get a better sense of what they actually want. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=8861.892s">So</a> there are benefits of doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=8864.174s">There's</a> also other aspects of the charter we could take a look at that I think would deserve some of our time, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=8868.877s">You</a> look at some of the provisions, changes that were being made to kind of make it easier to reduce public participation in our city government. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=8876.963s">You</a> know, we can go back, we can look at those and try to eliminate those. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=8881.306s">So</a> I think that's all I have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/l8nn1rt7aY0&t=8883.147s">Thank</a> you for listening.<h2><a href="../2025-01-28_Z5S9vVqtj_w/2025-01-28_Z5S9vVqtj_w.html">City Council 01-28-25</a></h2>
 <p>[Nick Giurleo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2811.205s">Good</a> evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2811.825s">Nick</a> Giurleo, 40 Robinson Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2813.526s">I'm</a> going to just speak briefly tonight in favor of the A paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2817.589s">And</a> I think the simple reason is that, really, this is something that we should be discussing, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2823.372s">Medford,</a> in its entire history, never approved a Prop 2.5 override before. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2828.574s">So</a> really, regardless where you fall on the issue, it is an unprecedented time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2833.457s">for</a> all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2834.297s">And</a> as Councilor Scarpelli represented, you know, there seems to be some legitimate concerns across the city among residents as to, you know, what will the impact of this be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2843.699s">And</a> the reality is taxes have gone up for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2847.14s">And</a> there is a huge cost of living crisis in the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2850.521s">So</a> it's really going to be harder now for members of our community to make <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2854.662s">ends</a> meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2856.324s">This</a> council talks often about affordability and how they're concerned about affordability, so let's do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2861.688s">Let's</a> talk about affordability. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2863.669s">And</a> we really do have to continue to think of the impact, especially on the most vulnerable of the community, like the elderly, veterans, people who are suffering from disabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2874.037s">They</a> face unique challenges. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2875.318s">They</a> deserve to be heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2877.405s">So</a> I really wouldn't see any kind of legitimate reason to have to go with the B paper here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2881.607s">I</a> think the A paper is innocuous enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2883.348s">I</a> don't think it's political. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2884.249s">I</a> think it can be approved on its own. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2887.951s">And</a> just generally, you know, as for unhappiness over, I would say, the outcome of the election, while I personally think it's justified, I mean, I agree that really this was a decision of the voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2898.736s">So,</a> you know, if you're not happy with the outcome, express that unhappiness at the ballot box in November. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2906.223s">It</a> seems like we have a pretty significant difference of opinion here as to how are we going to meet city funding needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2912.368s">So</a> if you don't like the fact that these overrides passed, show up in November and vote out of office to people who supported them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2920.153s">Express</a> that unhappiness. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2922.455s">That's</a> kind of how democracy works. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2924.276s">So</a> that's what I'll be doing, and I would encourage everyone else to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2927.799s">That's</a> all I have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/Z5S9vVqtj_w&t=2928.439s">Thank</a> you for listening.<h2><a href="../2025-01-14_zZxqrgNcAQo/2025-01-14_zZxqrgNcAQo.html">City Council 01-14-25</a></h2>

 <p>[Nick Giurleo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14587.15s">Nick</a> Giurleo, 40 Robinson Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14589.989s">Good</a> evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14590.509s">I</a> just want to comment tonight for the public, primarily coming before you as a licensed attorney just what exactly is in this welcoming city ordinance as I read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14601.774s">I</a> think it's common for legislators and not just the city council, but really all legislators in general to use kind of <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14607.947s">soft</a> kind of flowery language to describe what laws are really saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14612.99s">So</a> I think this welcoming ordinance is a pretty good example of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14616.592s">What</a> you might not realize, unless you actually read the fine print like I did, is that really the crux of it is not really to welcome anybody, but actually to just significantly hamper the police department's ability to do its job of working with fellow law enforcement to keep the community safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14633.803s">So</a> what do I mean by that? <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14635.544s">I</a> think the ordinance essentially prevents the Medford Police Department from cooperating with all federal law enforcement and enforcing immigration laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14644.05s">I</a> think, in my opinion, this is not only illegal, but also a seriously concerning violation of the concept of limited government, or as we've been hearing a lot tonight, separation of powers. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14655.196s">The</a> ordinance, for example, says that Medford PD can't comply with immigration detainers, detainers being requests from the federal government to hold a person who's in the country unlawfully. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14666.331s">So</a> this means even if the Medford PD became aware a person was violating a federal immigration law, Medford PD wouldn't be allowed to do anything about it, which is confusing to me because it's the job of law enforcement agencies to enforce the laws and our city council and mayor making it essentially unlawful for them to do their jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14686.359s">The</a> previous draft of the ordinance that I read mentioned a cause of action, basically giving an opportunity to sue the city at the taxpayer's expense if this ordinance were to be violated. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14698.343s">I'm</a> grateful to see that that's out of the ordinance now. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14701.404s">But</a> it was in there before, which I do think speaks to the motive behind this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14706.885s">Another</a> thing that concerns me is the very end where it talks about the Medford Police Department, having to report data on its detainers, and you think that data would go to write to this legislator the city council but. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14719.507s">That's</a> not what it says. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14720.368s">It</a> goes right to the mayor, which is a little suspicious to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14723.77s">So</a> my legal opinion is I think this is a legal ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14728.233s">And</a> even if it isn't, it shouldn't be. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14730.514s">And</a> I think it just is a matter of policy, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14732.816s">It's</a> terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14734.337s">Shouldn't</a> be on the books. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14735.638s">That's</a> my take. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14736.518s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iw3k1TZ1ejU&t=14737.599s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-11-12_NDgiDfoPie4/2024-11-12_NDgiDfoPie4.html">City Council 11-12-24</a></h2>

 <p>[Nick Giurleo]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3803.462s">Good</a> evening, Nick Giurleo, G-I-U-R-L-E-O 40 Robinson Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3808.786s">I'm</a> speaking in favor of this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3810.887s">I'm</a> very happy to see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3812.669s">Seniors</a> really are important in Medford, so it's good to reach out to them in any way we can on issues that really will impact them. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3820.995s">The</a> way I see this resolution, it's just calling for a fairly innocuous community meeting to give our seniors some information on what these ballot questions are really all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3830.722s">Given</a> my personal opinion that <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3833.311s">approval</a> of them will have a disastrous impact on seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3836.114s">I</a> think it's very important to educate them on the issues so they can come to those conclusions themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3842.199s">My</a> opinion is based on this just terrible cost of living crisis the country is facing. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3847.564s">That</a> crisis is due to fiscal irresponsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3850.567s">And</a> it seems like these ballot measures, if approved, are really gonna be promoting that, which has led to this cost-of-living crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3858.629s">There</a> really is, I think, some misinformation out there about what these ballot questions really are all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3865.01s">We</a> hear words being used, like investment, when we're not really saying what this really is, which is just taxation. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3873.212s">People</a> really are struggling. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3874.933s">It's</a> important to educate them on the issues so they can understand why they're struggling. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3880.932s">And</a> I would just highlight what the previous speaker said about the severe economic challenges that seniors throughout the country really are facing that I think we can all agree on. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3891.738s">They're</a> on fixed incomes. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3893.539s">And</a> data shows that when seniors on fixed incomes face unexpected increased costs, they're forced to forego necessities, necessities like food, necessities like prescription medications. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3906.437s">really</a> do have to be aware that recklessly raising taxes will have real consequences. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3911.381s">You</a> know, it's more than just harming the economic diversity of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3915.383s">In</a> some cases, this could be life or death for people who are vulnerable. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3919.086s">So</a> I would encourage everyone to approve of this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/_nS6u82anYk&t=3922.709s">Thank</a> you for listening.<h2><a href="../2024-07-24_Bg8-wFn44kc/2024-07-24_Bg8-wFn44kc.html">City Council 07-23-24</a></h2>
