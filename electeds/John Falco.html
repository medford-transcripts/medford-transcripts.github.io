 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=212.762s">Member</a> Ruseau here, Mayor Mungo here.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=3652.296s">Do</a> you want me to call the roll? <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=3653.857s">Or</a> do you want to call the roll for each thing? <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=3656.477s">I</a> think I can do it if the audio, I think, is probably better now. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=3660.518s">But</a> if it doesn't work out, then I'll. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=3663.139s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=3664.979s">Member</a> Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=3668.58s">Here.</a> 
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=3681.775s">Member</a> Hays?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=3684.616s">Member</a> Kreatz?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=3687.877s">Member</a> McLaughlin?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=3691.299s">Member</a> Musto?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=3693.699s">Member</a> Ruseau? <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=3694.42s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=3695.3s">Mayor</a> Lungo-Koehn?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=7770.991s">Thank</a> you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=7771.611s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Murphy for the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=7775.534s">I</a> do hope that when we whatever we send up the city council, at least as it is currently constituted is certainly going to want to discuss <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=7786.767s">food</a> insecurity, that was the resolution came from them as well as the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=7793.449s">So</a> those numbers that we just saw on the last slide excluded free universal food. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=7802.811s">So</a> I think you should be prepared at the meeting for those kinds of questions from them about how <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=7810.918s">you</a> know, how we're as a city going to meet our commitment to this resolution to make Medford, to resolve food security in Medford, it's only going to happen through actual action and spending. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=7827.062s">And</a> so I think we've kind of beaten it a bit in this meeting in the last couple of meetings to death, but we should be prepared for them to also have a little something to say on the matter, since we're not <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=7841.325s">Those</a> numbers do not include that, and I just think you should be prepared for that.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9280.155s">Member</a> Ruseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9281.716s">I'd</a> like to waive the reading of this policy as it's a particularly non-controversial policy and it's printed on the agenda.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9305.427s">Sure,</a> I'll speak briefly. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9307.068s">So</a> we did change the name of the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9310.269s">It's</a> sort of the biggest, most noticeable change, frankly. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9314.431s">I</a> guess school attorney is a historical, has some kind of historical reasons for being called that. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9322.34s">makes</a> me feel like was this back when there was one school in a school district. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9326.242s">But</a> the policy that we have before us, our current school attorney, committee attorney, which we're gonna continue to call school attorney, thought it looked great. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9337.105s">And</a> I don't really have anything to add to it other than I'd motion to approve the policy.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9445.746s">Member</a> Kreatz?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9448.63s">Member</a> McLaughlin?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9451.633s">Member</a> Mustone?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9454.236s">Member</a> Ruseau? <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9456.038s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9456.379s">Mayor</a> Longo?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9485.041s">I'd</a> like to make a motion to waive the reading of the details.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9498.145s">Yes,</a> this is when we when we finalized our rules <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9503.892s">One</a> of the motions we had was to authorize me to go through and look for policies that were no longer up to date based on our adopted rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9516.106s">And</a> this is an example of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9517.768s">So</a> in the current policy in the policy manual, it says <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9522.813s">a</a> bunch of things that are no longer the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9524.814s">So</a> I won't go through the gory details, but we do not accept public comment as in the form of an email, where the secretary or vice chair reads it out loud. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9537.38s">We</a> get away with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=9538.6s">And</a> this just brings the policy up to date.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=10354.682s">Member</a> Grant.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=10392.787s">I</a> believe this is just one that's continued on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/its9IWYSDBY&t=10395.888s">I</a> don't think there's actually anything to discuss yet.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_kp64eg_WEKE/2024-11-19_kp64eg_WEKE.html">City Council 12-21-21</a></h2>
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=344.838s">Thank</a> you console Scarpelli and Paulette, I wanted to thank you for your many, many years of service. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=352.261s">George</a> and I came on to the school committee at the same time and I was in 2010, we served you for six years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=359.064s">And</a> I remember when we first came on. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=363.457s">It</a> was always good to actually be able to talk to someone to, to get, you know, to find out, get a historical perspective as to like why we did things the way we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=372.303s">You</a> always had the answers, you always, you know, you always, you know, had valuable information. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=377.486s">And,</a> you know, I want to thank you for your many years of service. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=380.728s">And</a> thank your family as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=381.929s">32</a> years is a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=383.81s">And,</a> you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=386.672s">You</a> gave a lot to our community, to our public school system, and we appreciate all your hard work and effort, and thank you so much for your years of service to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=395.762s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=396.883s">Thank</a> you so much.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1228.813s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1231.154s">Nina,</a> if I may, you said quasi-filled. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1234.136s">Is</a> it filled or is it not filled?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1240.16s">It's</a> not filled.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1910.229s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1912.169s">I</a> wanna share, I agree with my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1914.99s">This</a> is a major concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1916.99s">I</a> know myself, I've been talking about this for months on end, and that there is absolutely no plan <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1924.232s">at</a> all with regard to ARPA from the administration, none $48 million in no plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1931.795s">We</a> have had, we have not had a CFO for six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1937.35s">Six</a> months we have $191 million budget we have no CFO $48 million in ARPA funding no CFO, and no one right now is currently managing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1947.814s">I</a> don't even think they're discussing opera in the finance office because I think they're basically trying to just do the day to day activities that that that occur on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1957.799s">This</a> is unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1959.444s">And</a> then they throw it on us to say, oh, we need all these positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1963.087s">There's</a> no planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1964.028s">There's</a> a complete lack of planning when it comes to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1966.951s">And</a> it's unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1968.532s">I</a> definitely could vote on the federal funds manager because I think that kicks us all off with regard to planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1976.339s">Eventually</a> we're gonna have to plan to do something with this money. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1979.702s">It's</a> unfortunate that the discussion has not happened yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1984.726s">And</a> if I may, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1987.44s">Cat</a> 15 Can you give us the range please.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2005.228s">Okay,</a> so that is the actual cat 15, but it was just listed as cap 12 on the original document.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2022.821s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2023.682s">And</a> who actually helps determine the actual caps? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=2027.485s">Is</a> that the chief people officer?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3052.857s">If</a> I may just quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3056.687s">This</a> is a 0.3, so this is 10 hours a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3058.949s">And</a> Marianne, did you say there's 600 people just in the month of December?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3130.783s">So</a> shouldn't it be more than a 0.5?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3161.446s">So,</a> we know we're going into this really not being staffed correctly.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3226.898s">I</a> don't disagree that you need the positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3230.379s">I</a> think one of the big concerns is the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3233.361s">And</a> that is that we've been talking about a pandemic for two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3238.543s">It's</a> not going away. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3241.758s">You</a> know, I think, you know, many of us or some of us are thinking that this would have been planned. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3249.925s">And</a> I'm not, this is not on you, but that this would have been planned out by the administration months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3255.409s">And</a> we just got this paper a few weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3259.552s">And</a> this goes back to Councilor Mark saying that there's no plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3265.637s">I</a> don't, excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3267.899s">You</a> can hop and pop all you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3269.14s">There's</a> no plan.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3277.935s">I'm</a> not saying that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3278.856s">I</a> just said, I didn't say that.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3757.643s">If</a> I may, Mr. President, this is the Steve Smerdy role, am I correct?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3768.211s">So</a> currently, is he straddling two roles as the COVID person and is he the interim communications director?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=3797.07s">This</a> person is going to be doing just COVID-related, he's going to be the COVID-19 public information officer and he'll be only doing COVID-related activities, correct?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5015.984s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5016.865s">I'd</a> like to wish Stella Tanaglia a happy 90th birthday. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5020.748s">Her</a> birthday is coming up this Friday, December 24th. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5024.652s">She's</a> a longtime resident of the city of Medford and a longtime city <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=5030.75s">City</a> Hall employee and member of St Francis Parish and St Francis mothers club so she's been involved in a lot of things throughout the city and I just wanted to say happy birthday, happy 90th birthday to her and best wishes.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6650.402s">No</a> problem.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6651.923s">Thank</a> you so much.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6674.217s">You</a> know, I will be brief.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6693.337s">I</a> can't thank you enough all for your very kind words. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6696.4s">It</a> is absolutely been a pleasure serving with each and every one of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6702.725s">Zach</a> and Nicole, it's only been two years, but Adam, George, Michael, Rick. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6708.848s">It's</a> been six and it has been an absolute pleasure to serve with each and every one of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6715.596s">You</a> know, we maybe didn't always agree on everything, but we agree to disagree and we move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6720.261s">Because</a> we always had the common goal of moving Medford forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6724.906s">That's</a> what was always most important to all of us and <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6729.497s">You</a> know, the council always works well when we work together, but there are disagreements, and we've had disagreements, but we move forward, and I think, you know, we've been a really good team, and we've got a lot of work done over the past six years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6743.223s">So</a> I thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6744.283s">It's</a> been a real pleasure working with each and every one here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6748.485s">I</a> wanna thank, you know, everyone here tonight, those that are at home, and especially thank my wife, Jackie, in the back, and my three sons, John, Joey, and Jack, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6759.738s">for</a> all of their support throughout the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6763.581s">You</a> know, to be a selected official, to be a successful elected official, you really need that support at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6770.506s">And</a> Jackie and the boys have always been very, very supportive. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6773.829s">So</a> I wanna thank them for their love and their support through the past 12 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6778.673s">It's</a> been an absolute honor and a privilege to serve the city of Medford the past 12 years as a member of the, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6788.133s">school</a> committee and as a member of the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6790.895s">And</a> I can't thank you enough for having the confidence in me to be reelected numerous times to the school committee and to the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6802.083s">During</a> my tenure in the school committee, I had the opportunity to work with some great people. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6806.271s">And</a> to make improvements both inside of the schools and outside of the schools, new science labs, field of dreams, updated technology, updated vocational school, renovated swimming pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6817.461s">But</a> that comes when you work as a team. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6819.283s">And</a> we did that on the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6820.864s">We</a> had the honor of working with some really great people. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6824.207s">Paula</a> Van der Kloot, Emery Cuno, Sharon Guzik, Billy O'Keefe, Bob Skerry, Aaron DiBenedetto, and my good friend, George Scarpell. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6833.492s">You</a> know, we keep like you said, George, we came into this 12 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6837.034s">And,</a> you know, I remember working really hard on the school committee when we came in. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6841.416s">And</a> we had all kinds of goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6843.197s">And</a> I think we accomplished a lot of those and we left at a better place. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6847.959s">But</a> you know, that continues and you know that the next group is stepping up in there, you know, they're making progress as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6854.482s">And</a> on the city council, I had an opportunity to work with some great talented people in spearheaded some projects here as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6860.825s">Like</a> I said, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6862.127s">Even</a> if, you know, I spare something individually or if any of us had something individual, it always takes the support of your colleagues to move it forward, like cameras in the community hall of the city council office, you know, to televise all of our meetings, you know, support of having our, you know, community police meetings moved out into the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6883.552s">You</a> know, those are things that zoning, zoning reform. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6886.553s">And</a> those are things that I like to think that <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6888.348s">I</a> let on, but you know, it takes support from your colleagues and you've all been very supportive. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6892.891s">So</a> I thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6895.033s">It's</a> been, like I said, it's, you know, it works well when the council works together and, you know, together we moved a lot of, you know, projects forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6904.921s">And</a> I thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6906.382s">You</a> know, President Caraviello, we've known each other for years and you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6909.944s">I</a> think there were many days I just had to talk to you more than I talked to Jackie, but you know, it's our passion for, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6916.566s">City</a> politics and making the city a better place. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6919.327s">Council</a> and I. You've been great to talk to probably one of the smartest people I know in city government knows how things work. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6926.41s">And,</a> you know, process procedure and you've always been on top of that and, you know, I thank you for all your help and the guidance there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6939.074s">Our</a> friendship goes back a long way. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6941.316s">And,</a> you know, there were many times where, you know, we'd have serious conversations, but we'd laugh a lot along the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6947.46s">And</a> that always helped. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6951.283s">Councilor</a> Marks, the senior statesman of the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6955.767s">I</a> can't even tell you how many times probably over the past year, I looked at you and I said, well, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6963.312s">He's</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6964.515s">It's</a> absolutely right, just here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6968.636s">I</a> realized just over time, but it's funny, you had the experience, it's been valuable. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6976.559s">And</a> I think that's something that we always have to remember, I think as Councilors moving forward, is that there's processes and there's procedures and they're there for a reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6986.122s">And</a> you always make a good point saying, this is how we're supposed to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6991.063s">And</a> a lot can be said for that, because when you don't have processes and procedures, things fall apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=6996.645s">And</a> it's important that we follow those processes and procedures and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7001.126s">And</a> I thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7002.207s">It's</a> been a pleasure serving with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7004.207s">And</a> thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7007.529s">Fred</a> DeLaRusso, not here tonight, but he was someone that I truly enjoyed sharing, working with over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7015.791s">I</a> maybe didn't agree with him all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7031.36s">Fred,</a> he was great to work with. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7035.701s">We</a> didn't agree on a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7036.961s">I</a> shouldn't say we didn't agree on a lot, but there were many things we didn't agree on. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7039.242s">But</a> once again, we agreed to disagree. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7041.743s">He</a> was someone that I could call, someone that I could talk to. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7045.224s">And</a> he was fabulous to work with. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7047.804s">Zach</a> and Nicole, like I said, we only worked together for two years, but you've been great to work with. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7054.786s">I</a> know if I ever, Nicole's on screen here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7058.209s">But</a> I know it's always been, if I need to call you and talk to you, it's always been a pleasure talking to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7064.795s">You</a> always take my calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7066.476s">And</a> it's been great working with the both of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7069.659s">So</a> I thank you very much for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7072.021s">And</a> I thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7074.443s">for</a> working with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7076.244s">You've</a> both been great. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7078.085s">And,</a> you know, and I also want to thank Mayor McGlynn and Mayor Stephanie Michini-Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7082.406s">You</a> know, I worked with them both on the school committee and on the city council for 12 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7088.589s">They,</a> you know, leadership starts at the top and they led a lot of great initiatives and did a lot of great work. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7096.672s">Representative</a> Donato. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7099.6s">You've</a> been a friend for many years, and it has always been a pleasure working with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7104.663s">I</a> thank you for your friendship and for your advice through the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7110.307s">You've</a> been great to work with. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7111.828s">If</a> I ever had any questions regarding what was happening at the state level and how it was going to impact our city, you always did answer and answer the call, and I thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7126.213s">And</a> I represent about Lee and representative Barbara and Senate jail and I thank them as well and it's it's it's been an honor to work with with all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7137.484s">And</a> thank you to the department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7139.465s">Now</a> there are many department heads that we have here at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7143.529s">There</a> are many that don't work here any longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7145.55s">I</a> want to thank them, both those that are here and those that aren't here any longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7151.435s">I</a> thank them. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7152.616s">And</a> I thank all of the workers in the City of Medford and the school system that are here day in, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7159.982s">day</a> out, making it happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7162.323s">You</a> know, the policemen, the police officers, the firefighters, like I said, everyone in this in our school system, thanks to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7169.706s">I</a> mean, take a look at the people that you know, we don't think of that, not that we don't think of that often, but the people that are always there working 24 seven, there's a there's a water leak in the middle of February and <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7180.09s">someone's</a> freezing water, trying to repair it to make sure that people have running water in their neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7185.592s">And</a> those are the people that they're not recognized as often as they should. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7192.214s">And</a> I wanna thank each and every one of them for all of their help, all of their support, answering my phone calls when I had questions that needed to be answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7201.876s">So</a> I wanna thank them as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7204.457s">And</a> Larry Lepore, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7208.207s">Thank</a> you for being here every week. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7209.447s">I</a> apologize that you have had to look at the back of my head for the past six years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7216.93s">But</a> it has been an absolute pleasure working with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7218.931s">You've</a> always had a smile on your face. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7220.571s">You've</a> been great to talk to. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7222.752s">It's</a> always nice to see you when you drop by with the agenda every Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7226.293s">So</a> I thank you for being a good friend for the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7229.421s">And</a> I want to wish I just didn't get. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7232.924s">Good</a> luck. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7233.344s">You</a> know, I hope you enjoy this as much as I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7237.667s">This</a> has been a thrill of a lifetime to represent the residents of our great city, and I want to wish you well in the future years and in the term ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7248.695s">On</a> a personal note, I want to thank my campaign committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7252.105s">In</a> all my friends that have helped out with the various campaigns over the past 12 years, I believe they say it's not about the destination, it's about the journey. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7262.589s">And</a> it's been an amazing journey over the past 12 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7265.49s">I</a> have met a lot of friends that will be friends for life. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7270.811s">And</a> I can say that, especially in the past year running for mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7275.856s">There's</a> so many people that I met along the way that he did not know prior to that were just fabulous and they're great friends today, and they'll always be friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7286.145s">And,</a> you know, in, you know, in hindsight thinking back at the 12 years they think about. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7294.29s">condolence</a> resolutions that come up every so often. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7297.391s">And,</a> you know, you start to think about the many community members that we've lost along the way and the impact that they've had. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7305.055s">And,</a> you know, and, you know, I just, it brings back fond memories, the people and the impact that they've had on our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7312.258s">And,</a> you know, they had a big impact on what we do here each week as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7318.461s">In</a> closing, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7322.015s">I</a> thank everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7323.075s">Like</a> I said, it has been an honor and a privilege to represent everyone here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7328.197s">I</a> absolutely love this job and I hope that I have served you well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7333.76s">Thank</a> you for the

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=969.113s">I</a> completely understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=969.873s">That's</a> fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=970.834s">So</a> the $100,000 for supplies, what's that going to be used on if it's not vehicles, I guess?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1010.129s">And</a> as far as the, so what's the, do you know what the cost difference is between a three year lease and a five year lease?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1035.115s">And</a> as far as the two vehicles that we're getting back from Republic to the 2014 and 2016, do you know if they have a, <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1046.079s">A</a> ton of miles on those.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=1070.437s">They</a> won't give you the mileage?

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4402.658s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4404.339s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4404.94s">I</a> know this isn't easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4406.141s">And</a> I do share the concerns of the planning questions that were raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4417.287s">And</a> I think, you know, you're in a tough position too, because you've only been here six weeks and, you know, the decision to bring parking into the city, I had to have a city manager made a while back. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4429.595s">And</a> I think that, <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4430.63s">you</a> know, in between you being hired and that decision, not a lot happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4435.292s">And</a> I think that's the unfortunate piece, because I think there does need to be a lot of planning for this to move forward, especially for it to be successful, you know, on January 6th. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4445.856s">And</a> I think that's going to be the really tough piece is that, you know, you really don't want there to be any drop off on January 6th. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4453.313s">you</a> know, but that's got that point of information.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4458.918s">I</a> will tell you, I will tell you that I paid the ticket that I got a couple of weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4464.122s">So</a> they asked, so I'll be the first one to tell you that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4471.096s">But,</a> you know, I do have some concerns too. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4474.097s">I</a> mean, you know, we talked about vehicles, just a few minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4477.519s">Well,</a> when I first asked my question earlier in the meeting, we talked about vehicles and you mentioned about how you're unable to see the mileage on one of the vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4486.363s">And</a> then President Caraviello mentions that there's newer cars driving around. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4489.964s">So</a> I have a lot of questions as to why don't we have <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4493.606s">the</a> correct inventory. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4496.788s">Why</a> don't we have the correct inventory of how many vehicles are coming over? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4500.551s">When</a> is this all said and done? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4502.392s">That</a> number we should have right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4503.993s">We</a> should know it's two cars, five cars, four cars.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4512.088s">But</a> we're hearing that, we're hearing that.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4549.862s">That's</a> all you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4553.641s">Okay,</a> so still a concern, even though there's two in the contract, it sounds like there might be some more out there, but we don't know for sure.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4562.19s">And</a> I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4563.571s">And</a> as far as the meters and the equipment, have you received a full inventory of what we're receiving back and what condition it's in and how old it is and that type of stuff?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4573.401s">Oh,</a> you have, okay.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4575.261s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4576.062s">And</a> you said you're meeting with Republic Parking, is it next week?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4582.291s">And</a> have you met yet prior to that?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4611.781s">You</a> can't talk transition with the current parking company on your own?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4625.756s">Without</a> the legal team with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4626.877s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4627.378s">Which</a> would be city solicitor Scanlon? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4629.801s">Or</a> is it KP Law? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4631.323s">KP</a> Law.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4635.508s">So</a> we have KP Law and city solicitor Scanlon?

I'm glad Faye's here and I wish you success. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4748.702s">I</a> do have some concerns, you know, with regard to the law tonight, the contract, I do have concerns about, you know, when I hear that there could be additional vehicles, even though there's two in the contract, I get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=4760.585s">So,</a> but I thank you for your time tonight and I thank you for answering our questions.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1296.151s">If</a> you could schedule that on a Wednesday, I think that would be the best bet. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1298.531s">Because</a> I know I have a ton of questions, as I'm sure my colleagues do as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1302.832s">But</a> there are a lot of things, I think, that need to be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1307.633s">It's</a> very frustrating. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1309.133s">Here</a> we are a month later, and we're doing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1312.474s">But</a> we need to do this as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1314.774s">It'll</a> be next Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1316.775s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1317.475s">I</a> appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1318.255s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=4447.387s">I</a> myself have been raking a lot recently and I noticed still in my neighborhood, there's still a lot of leaves, still a lot of trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=4454.112s">And</a> so I think we should at least have another, at least one if not two pickups. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=4459.295s">So</a> thank you for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=4460.656s">This</a> is something that we all encounter year after year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=4463.878s">It</a> needs to go later into the season. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=4465.559s">So</a> I would definitely encourage at least one or two more pickups.

href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=429.062s">And</a> we need to make sure that we're constantly working to improve our school system. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=433.984s">When</a> I take a look at my time on the school committee, and I mentioned previously about changes that we made both inside and outside of the classroom, we put in brand new science labs, technology district-wide. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=448.828s">We</a> actually refurbished the swimming pool. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=452.329s">We</a> put in new athletic fields. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=454.71s">We</a> upgraded our vocational school to offer STEM subjects like engineering, biotechnology. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=461.732s">And</a> we actually improved some of the machinery within those programs as well. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=467.617s">And</a> one of the big things that we also did was we started before and after school programming, before and after school care. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=475.203s">And</a> that's important for our working families. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=477.445s">And</a> I want to come back as mayor and bring those all full circle. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=481.628s">So</a> when I look at the before and after school programming, the lottery for that closed on March 1st. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=488.633s">To</a> me, that's unacceptable. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=490.154s">We</a> need to make sure we're providing before and after school programming to all our working families, all our families that want it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=497.418s">To</a> me, there's a real need out there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=498.739s">We</a> need to provide that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=500.18s">So</a> that's a main priority. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=501.861s">I</a> want to look at our vocational school and make sure that we have, you know, the latest and greatest with regard to technology, not just in the vocational school, but throughout the district. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=511.468s">We</a> need to make sure that we are providing our students all of the equipment and technology they need to succeed. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=519.113s">So</a> basically giving them the tools that they need to succeed. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=522.155s">That</a> is a major priority. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=525.397s">We</a> also need to, you know, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=527.478s">take</a> a look at the programs that we're offering to make sure that they're current with the jobs that currently are in the, the jobs that are available once they graduate from high school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=539.588s">So</a> we need to take a look at that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=541.73s">Got</a> to the vocational school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=543.452s">And</a> we just need to, I want to make sure I come back and I want to be the mayor that brings all these things full circle. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=550.638s">So</a> those are some of the main education priorities. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=555.862s">When</a> I take a look at infrastructure, as I've gone from neighborhood to neighborhood, street to street, door to door, and I talk to residents, no matter what neighborhood you're in, one of the big topics that comes up is infrastructure. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=569.252s">It's</a> a major priority. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=571.654s">Our</a> streets are in bad shape. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=574.036s">Some</a> of our sidewalks are crumbling. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=575.797s">And</a> these things need to be addressed. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=577.919s">And</a> there needs to be a plan. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=579.48s">And</a> currently, I feel that there really is no plan. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=583.863s">So</a> that's a major issue. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=586.484s">When</a> I take a look at the energy and the environment, we can always do work there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=590.865s">Climate</a> change is the biggest issue of our lifetime. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=593.526s">It's</a> a global issue, but there's a lot we can do at the local level. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=597.006s">And</a> we need to make sure that we have more electric charging stations throughout the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=603.548s">We</a> need to make sure that we have, I think, over 200 vehicles, city-owned vehicles, in the city of Medford with regard to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=611.07s">police,</a> fire vehicles, DPW vehicles, the school vehicles as well. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=615.532s">We</a> need to gradually transition those over to electric vehicles. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=619.114s">We</a> also need to make sure we're expanding our tree canopy. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=623.376s">That's</a> a huge priority. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=624.477s">We</a> need to be growing more trees. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=626.418s">And</a> we need to make sure that we are taking a look at <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=633.272s">We</a> have a river that runs right through the middle of our downtown. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=636.254s">It's</a> a beautiful river. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=637.475s">We</a> should be embracing that river. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=640.317s">But</a> we also need to make sure that, you know, we talk about climate change and rising tides, and we need to make sure that our sewer system, our sewer infrastructure is prepared to handle rising tides. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=653.085s">I</a> get calls from residents all over the city, especially recently, you know, we're getting these, you know, microbursts of rainstorms that happen. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=661.63s">you</a> know, there's increased flooding throughout the city no matter where you live. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=664.351s">I</a> got a call a couple weeks ago from someone up in North Medford, down in West Medford, down by Placedead Road, you know, and down by the river as well. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=672.773s">You</a> know, so there are increased, you know, there are occurrences of, you know, flooding that happen on a regular basis now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=681.675s">But</a> I know that there are many residents that live down by the river that are concerned about this. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=687.381s">And</a> we need to make sure that our sewer infrastructure can handle water, especially in short periods of time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=695.53s">And</a> so that's a major concern. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=696.651s">So</a> we need to take a look at that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=698.293s">And</a> we also need to take a look at the Amelia Earhart Dam. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=702.339s">That's</a> a concern. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=703.6s">As</a> tides rise, we need to make sure that that dam is suitable for the future, sustainable for the future. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=709.368s">So</a> we need to work with the state to make sure that that is going to be <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=715.736s">We</a> need to make sure that it's structurally sound and sustainable for the future as far as with rising tides. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=722.019s">So</a> those are things that we need to work with the state with on an issue like that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=726.722s">There's</a> also diversity and inclusion, and that's something that to me is a huge priority. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=736.908s">The</a> mayor, I think, for pretty much the past year and a half was trying to merge human resources with diversity and inclusion. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=743.212s">To</a> me, that's going backwards. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=744.853s">I</a> take a look at our city, 59,000 residents, 4,000 kids in a public school system, over 1,000 municipal employees. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=752.437s">We</a> deserve a standalone diversity, inclusion, and equity office. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=757.24s">And</a> that person should be working hand-in-hand with <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=760.682s">the</a> school staff to make sure that they're working hand-in-hand on a daily basis. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=768.528s">City</a> side, school side, we're developing programs. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=771.35s">We're</a> really tackling issues of diversity, inclusion, and equity. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=777.475s">Method</a> is more diverse than it's ever been. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=779.476s">We</a> need to embrace that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=780.817s">We</a> need to have programming around that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=782.559s">And</a> we can do more, and we should be doing more.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=799.582s">I</a> know we have translation services, but I don't think we have anybody that's doing that outreach. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=804.327s">But</a> that's something that we need to, you know, so these are things that I think we need to work on more as a community. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=810.754s">We're</a> talking about diversity, inclusion, equity. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=813.276s">We</a> need to have meetings on a regular basis. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=815.198s">They</a> should be monthly meetings. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=816.9s">And</a> we have a lot that we need to do, a lot of work that we need to do here. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=821.713s">as</a> diverse as it's ever been. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=823.456s">We</a> need to embrace that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=824.537s">And</a> we need to make sure that we're offering programming that supports that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=828.083s">And</a> we need to make sure we're offering funding. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=829.825s">We</a> have to make sure that we have a line item and a budget for diversity inclusion. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=833.49s">We</a> need to make a commitment to this. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=834.933s">And</a> that's important.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=855.82s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=856.24s">So</a> I think as far as being more equitable, I think this position here, I think that having <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=867.072s">This</a> position, I think, would work with the school, in my eyes, would work with the school system and make sure that the, you know, we are doing more to make sure that the employees that work for the city of Manhattan reflect the diversity of our community. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=880.475s">And,</a> you know, we have a long way to go there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=882.655s">So</a> that position would help with that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=885.076s">I</a> also think, you know, as far as equity goes, we need to look at, you know, affordable housing, making sure that we have, you know, more affordable housing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=894.078s">Take</a> a look at, you know, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=896.237s">My</a> wife and I, sometimes we'll sit down and we'll talk about, where are our kids going to live someday? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=902.219s">Of</a> course we want them to live close by, we'd love for them to live in Medford, and hopefully they want to live in Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=908.182s">But</a> homes now are selling for $800,000, $900,000, a million dollars. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=917.345s">That's</a> a lot of money. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=918.206s">So</a> after school, when you're working or going to college, to buy a home in Medford, it's really hard. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=925.353s">So</a> we need to make sure that we're offering more affordable housing opportunities in our city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=930.939s">Since</a> I've been on the city council, I led an effort to establish an inclusionary housing ordinance. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=940.562s">And</a> that ordinance basically guarantees affordable housing units for different developments, depending on how many units they're building. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=949.167s">So</a> that's one improvement that we've had with regard to inclusionary housing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=954.771s">We</a> can also do work to an affordable housing trust as well. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=958.813s">I've</a> offered a resolution with regard <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=961.895s">establishing</a> an affordable housing trust, and it's currently in the committee. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=967.376s">We're</a> working on it, but that, to me, that'll be a priority if elected mayor, is to actually establish an affordable housing trust in the community. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=975.858s">We</a> have so many affordable housing issues, and there are a lot of people that want to live here. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=982.139s">Bedford's</a> a very desirable place to live, and we need to make sure that there are affordable housing opportunities for everyone.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1012.681s">A</a> lot of people want to live here, but like you said, even renting a home now is renting an apartment. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1020.684s">It</a> costs a lot of money. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1021.384s">Yeah,</a> for sure. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1022.245s">Yeah,</a> we're in a very desirable location. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1024.125s">We're</a> five miles north of Austin. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1026.206s">And</a> that's, you know, a lot of people like being close to the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1029.907s">And,</a> you know, it's, bottom line, it's really expensive to live in the city of Medford.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1046.835s">What</a> I appreciate most about the City of Medford is there's so many different organizations throughout our city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1054.197s">I</a> always tell people, there's so much that you can do. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1058.897s">You</a> really can't be bored, especially if you want to get involved. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1061.198s">There's</a> different organizations that do a lot of great things. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1066.279s">And</a> I'll go back to one of my favorites, and that's the Medford Family Network. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1072.6s">It's</a> a great place to really get involved, and they have great programming for kids and parents. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1080.084s">But</a> it's also a great way to just give back your time, and to learn, and to take on parent leadership roles, and really helping to guide the network forward. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1094.631s">And</a> there's also fundraising opportunities and stuff like that if you want to do that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1099.334s">But</a> to me, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1102.175s">the</a> network's always been there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1103.696s">And</a> the thing that I like most about not only just the Medford Family Network, but a lot of our organizations throughout our community is the way people help out, the way people give back. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1115.001s">There</a> are a lot of great people in our community that are always giving back. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1119.123s">I</a> mean, I always take a look at the Medford Family Network. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1123.005s">They</a> put a call out every fall when the kids go back to school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1128.868s">And,</a> you know, they have a school supply drive. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1131.05s">And,</a> you know, people give, you know, notebooks, crayons, markers, you name it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1135.413s">And</a> there's a ton of supplies that come in. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1137.574s">And,</a> you know, and they give those supplies to students, you know, that need the supplies. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1142.477s">Not</a> everybody has access to that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1144.279s">And,</a> you know, so we have a lot of very charitable people in our community. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1148.742s">They</a> get involved in a lot of different organizations. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1151.544s">But</a> the Filming Network is one of my favorites. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1155.666s">And,</a> you know, I, you know, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1158.488s">When</a> I represented the MFN at the state level, we used to go to those meetings once a month. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1164.232s">And</a> I always tell everyone about the great things happening at the MFN Family Network. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1168.675s">And</a> one of the things that people would always say to me is, how do we get a family network in our community? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1175.86s">And</a> it's great that we have something like that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1178.102s">I</a> know a lot of other communities would love to have. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1181.404s">a</a> family network in the community. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1182.645s">But</a> I'm so grateful that we have it.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1201.257s">I</a> think I mentioned this previously, but I mean, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1206.26s">We</a> met parents there 20 years ago that we're still friends with today. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1210.001s">And</a> it's just a great place to meet people. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1215.662s">And</a> there's just a lot of community events around that, too. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1221.064s">So</a> it's been a great experience.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1236.81s">Something</a> will be surprising. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1242.859s">I</a> learned, so I think people get surprised sometimes when they hear this, but so when we bought a home, my wife and I bought a home back, let's see, 17 years ago. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1254.446s">I</a> will admit, I never really thought it was that handy, but when you buy a home, of course, you're cash-strapped up to that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1265.033s">And</a> I think, you know, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1269.459s">I</a> realized I'm a lot handier than I thought. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1273.885s">So</a> I definitely will try to tackle any project I can, from painting to trying to putting in a floor and stuff like that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1281.375s">So</a> I think people get surprised at that, because they probably don't look at me as someone who's like that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1286.682s">You</a> know, I've learned to do a lot of things over the years. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1291.427s">And</a> it's helped out, it's helped save money, which is good. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1294.75s">And</a> actually, I mean, I actually enjoy it, too. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1297.832s">So</a> that's, you know, I think that's kind of surprising.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1302.817s">It</a> did, because to be honest with you, you know, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1306.4s">As</a> things say, sometimes we bought a house that was built in 1929, and things go, and things always need to be repaired. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1314.887s">And</a> I figured, you know what, I'll try to tackle these as I can on my own. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1319.39s">And</a> I've managed pretty good so far.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1329.438s">Oh,</a> absolutely. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1330.88s">Some</a> of the best advice I received was from my parents. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1334.664s">And</a> my parents always said, you know, leave no stone unturned. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1338.809s">You</a> know, make sure you, you know, inquire, ask questions. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1343.234s">Always,</a> always <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1346.437s">you</a> know, encourage me to be involved, be engaged in what's going on, be part of the community, you know, really, you know, try to give back, you know, and that's something that I've always done. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1356.804s">I've,</a> you know, I try to instill those same values in my kids as well, you know, be part of the, you know, be part of the community, get involved. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1367.111s">And</a> so that's always, that's something I always encourage. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1371.834s">And</a> the other piece of advice was, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1374.357s">You</a> know, uh, it's, uh, um... <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1378.505s">We're</a> born with two ears and one mouth, so we do twice as much listening. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1382.467s">And</a> I think you'll see even on the council, I mean, I'm not someone who's yelling and screaming, and I do a lot of listening. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1390.911s">And</a> I love to listen when people come up to that rail and they want to tell us what's on their mind. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1397.194s">I</a> think that's always valuable, because we have a lot of issues that come before us, but it's always good to listen to the people that come before us. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1407.259s">they're</a> telling us what their issues are, or they may be just giving an opinion on something. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1411.366s">But</a> I find it always interesting to... <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1415.201s">find</a> out how did they get to that decision. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1416.742s">You</a> know, and they usually walk us through that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1419.324s">We'll</a> ask questions back. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1420.984s">But,</a> so to me, you know, I always, you know, listen first and get all the details and, you know, ask good questions or try to ask good questions and go from there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1430.83s">So</a> that's I think some of the best advice I've ever received.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1455.171s">Well,</a> if there's anything I've learned in my 12 years of city government is that <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1461.136s">I</a> think one of the most important things you can do is listen to people. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1465.059s">If</a> people are coming down to the city council meeting, they have concerns. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1468.201s">They</a> have issues that need to be addressed. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1470.202s">So</a> I think that one of the most important things we can do is listen to them and try to figure out, well, how can we resolve these issues, solve these problems? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1478.788s">And</a> even outside of that, if there's, I don't know, something going on in a particular neighborhood, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1486.762s">We</a> want to make sure that we give people the opportunity to speak up on an issue, and that's why the city council and the school committee, they're important roles. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1498.366s">We</a> want to make sure that people can come down, give their opinion, and we might not always agree with them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1507.009s">I</a> might not always agree with them, but I hear them out, and I'll be honest here, a lot of people that I might not agree with, I actually like to listen to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1516.725s">You</a> know, how did they get to that point? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1519.047s">And,</a> you know, I always find that interesting. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1521.648s">And,</a> you know, I've learned a lot of things along the way just by listening to people. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1525.211s">And</a> I think that's probably one of the most important pieces of the job is listening to people, find out what's on people's mind, and see how we can help them out.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1544.131s">To</a> me, I absolutely love living in Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1549.014s">I've</a> lived here for many years, and I want to make Medford a better place. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1554.456s">I</a> think there's a lot of work that we can do. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1556.597s">It's</a> a great place to work, play, raise a family, and I really feel that we can do better than we're doing now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1571.123s">$48</a> million that's going to be coming in from the American Rescue Plan. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1574.306s">That</a> can have a significant impact on our community and really give us the opportunity to emerge from this pandemic bigger and better than ever before. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1582.572s">And</a> we need to make sure that there's a plan to spend that money. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1588.797s">Currently,</a> there's no plan and there needs to be community input because at the end of the day, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1594.602s">That</a> $48 million belongs to the taxpayers of our city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1599.768s">And</a> they need to be involved in that process. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1601.53s">There</a> needs to be dialogue. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1603.412s">If</a> you take a look at our neighbors in Malden and in Arlington, they've already had community input. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1609.178s">They've</a> already had dialogue. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1611.22s">And</a> they're moving forward with the plan. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1615.447s">We</a> have no chief financial officer right now. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1617.39s">We</a> haven't had a chief financial officer for four months. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1619.712s">That</a> is a key role. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1621.214s">In</a> order to establish that plan and move things forward, we need to have a chief financial officer. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1626.081s">So</a> to me, that's a high-priority item. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1628.884s">But</a> coming up with a plan for the $48 million, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1632.068s">is</a> key. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1633.109s">It's</a> really going to help us emerge from this pandemic and we need to come up with a plan to do that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1637.375s">If</a> elected, that's going to be one of the first things I work on is coming up with a plan with regard to ARPA and how we're going to spend that money and there'll be plenty of community input.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1653.372s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1655.614s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1656.034s">It's</a> been exciting. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1656.755s">I</a> thank you for the opportunity. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1658.116s">This</a> has been a lot of fun. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1659.197s">This</a> is my first podcast. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1660.438s">I've</a> never done this before. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1661.939s">Mine</a> too. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1664.101s">This</a> has been great, and I just wanted to say thank you for the opportunity. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1667.483s">Thanks</a> for coming. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ofZPVsLWUSs6cmYTXSoBg?t=1668.244s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_uVH2naDKUEE/2024-11-19_uVH2naDKUEE.html">City Council 10-26-21</a></h2>
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=1451.829s">Now</a> it's on.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=1726.204s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=1727.865s">And</a> I have to, Mr. President, I agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=1730.526s">I</a> think you made a very good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=1731.967s">You</a> take a look at Mystic Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=1733.307s">It</a> is probably one of the most heavily traversed streets in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=1739.07s">And</a> it's been ripped up. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=1739.95s">It's</a> been ripped up for a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=1741.251s">We</a> have one chance to get this done and get it done right. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=1744.313s">And</a> I have some serious concerns now. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=1748.935s">You</a> know, <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=1750.281s">Tim,</a> I mean, we all knew it was gonna rain Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=1754.166s">I</a> mean, is that really the best time to put down hot top or asphalt? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=1760.295s">I</a> mean, is that the best time? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=1761.837s">I</a> mean, could we wait another week? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=1764.14s">I</a> don't understand the rush at this point.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=1931.074s">And</a> I understand, and I understand there's never a perfect time for this, but I guess my other concern now is, you know, we're talking about, it's been resurfaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=1941.302s">Now</a> we're talking about the quality of the resurfacing and whether or not there was enough asphalt put down. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=1946.745s">And</a> now it's been raining for three days by the time this is all said and done. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=1951.469s">And</a> now if it needs more asphalt on top, I would imagine that moisture is gonna set in. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=1957.113s">You</a> know-
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2064.833s">But</a> it sounds like there are pieces of this, of this road that we could possibly dig up to make sure it's done right if it wasn't done right the first time.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2100.672s">Okay,</a> so I'm just concerned that we're digging up new pavement already. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2105.274s">That</a> seems to be one of the biggest complaints I get is when we're putting down new roads and all of a sudden, you know, someone's in there a week later digging up <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2114.424s">pavement</a> right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2115.345s">I</a> mean, that's the last thing I think anyone wants to see is that we're going to be digging up roads, when it was just recently resurfaced so that that's definitely a concern, and I always think about the structural integrity after that because I feel like anytime you dig into a road. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2130.113s">Afterwards,</a> I mean, it's always just, you just get potholes, it's falling apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2134.898s">And</a> if you look throughout our community, you know, infrastructure is a major issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2139.322s">And</a> we have potholes no matter what neighborhood you go to, there are potholes throughout this city that need to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2146.329s">And</a> I'm really concerned that we're having this road, it's recently been paved, and I feel like it could very, <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2154.395s">It's</a> very possible that there could be issues already so that that's, that's one of my big concerns I'm also concerned about, you know, the AI engineers, you know, I mean how to do they they will burst and what our standards are here in the city of Medford with regard to paving.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2231.942s">So</a> when they put down the road and they resurface the road, AI engineers are present and they're evaluating the process and making sure that it meets the standards that are set forth by your office, I'm assuming. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2245.366s">So</a> if something's not right, are you notified right away? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2248.887s">Is</a> there an engineer in your office notified right away or do you wait for the weekly report? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2253.628s">How</a> does that work?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2286.315s">So</a> with regard to the road surfacing, in this case, was were you notified right away? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2290.418s">Or</a> did AI wait a few days? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2292.98s">How</a> did that work?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2316.933s">So</a> what's the process from here on out? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2318.954s">I</a> mean, so if you know there's an issue, do you go down right away and check it out so it can be, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2324.943s">remedy</a> right away or do you just wait for the report and go from there?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2461.033s">Tim,</a> last question. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2462.434s">Councilmarks</a> mentioned earlier about those sidewalks going from Lorain Road to Playstead. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2467.457s">I</a> know you said you're working on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2468.638s">Do</a> you have any type of a timeframe as to when you think you might have an answer as to whether or not that's something that we can do?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2550.179s">And</a> I couldn't hear that though. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2551.84s">You</a> said that there was a stormwater something. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2554.863s">Can</a> you repeat that please?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2617.855s">Tim,</a> thank you very much for your help. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2618.975s">Appreciate</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=2620.055s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4069.255s">Let's</a> go. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4070.076s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4071.076s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4073.278s">I</a> have received many calls as well from residents in that neighborhood, because as Councilor Morell said, there are many residents that are impacted on Winthrop Street with regard to this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4085.365s">And</a> there are students impacted as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4087.006s">There's</a> many students walking to and from school. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4090.168s">It's</a> a blasting area. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4091.649s">It's</a> dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4093.371s">And</a> you're right, as far as getting information, you know everybody's trying to get information and it seems like sometimes it's absolutely impossible to get. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4099.817s">I</a> would, I would ask you, Mr. President, if you schedule committee the whole week and talk specifically about this development. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4108.79s">with</a> regard to the blasting in all, there's many other areas that this impacts. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4113.855s">I</a> mean, specifically there's some questions that I like answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4116.577s">So</a> if I could read them off now, and Mr. Clark, if you wouldn't mind recording these, but first and foremost, you know, the pre-blast survey, what homes were included? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4125.947s">I</a> want to know exactly what homes are included in this neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4128.169s">There's</a> really, there are many, many residents that are being impacted and this needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4134.535s">You</a> know, Medford High School is next door. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4136.736s">So,</a> you know, when are the blasts actually occurring? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4139.759s">Are</a> they on schedule? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4141.06s">Is</a> it, you know, X amount per day? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4143.341s">That</a> seems to be all over the place from people that I've talked to in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4147.365s">So</a> it'd be great to get a clear, concise answer as to when these blasts are occurring. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4152.629s">Is</a> it limited to so many per day? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4154.73s">What</a> are the protocols for, you know, before they blast? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4158.193s">You</a> know, I know, I believe you can get text messages, but if we can get clarification on that, <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4163.855s">I</a> greatly appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4165.517s">And</a> is there any impact on the school, Medford High School? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4172.665s">I'd</a> appreciate if we can get an answer maybe from the high school administration to see if there's any impact with regard to the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4180.247s">traveling</a> to and from school. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4182.549s">That</a> is a sidewalk that's on the same side as a school. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4186.332s">We</a> need to make sure our students are safe traveling in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4189.414s">In</a> addition to the residents that actually live in that area, we need to make sure everyone's safe, but the students are traversing back and forth to and from school on the sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4199.282s">We</a> need to make sure that that's addressed as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4202.183s">And</a> as far as the vibration, vibration can have an effect, I think, as we all know, with regard to rodents in the rodent population. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4210.447s">And</a> we've received calls, I think all of us, with regard to rodents throughout our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4215.99s">I'd</a> like to know from the Board of Health, is there an increase of calls with regard to rodents in this neighborhood with blasting, the grounds moving on a regular basis up there? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4226.775s">I</a> want to know, there are increased calls to the Board of Health Department with regard to road, so if you can get an answer on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4233.779s">And</a> last but not least, the Water Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4237.201s">When</a> there's blasting, there's pipes underground. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4239.202s">I'd</a> like to know if there are any reports of pipes that have been broken. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4246.347s">underneath</a> the ground, city pipes, you know, blasts, we have blasting repeatedly like that, it has a toll on the infrastructure, and we need to make sure that infrastructure is safe, and that if there are any issues, we should know about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4260.668s">So</a> I think Councilor Morell for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4263.812s">I</a> think she's probably received some calls that I'm getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4267.035s">And</a> it's, you know, to live in that situation like that we're, you know, the company is coming in and they're blasting day after day after day for, you know, months on end, it's, it's, it hasn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4280.327s">a</a> horrible impact on your quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4282.789s">These</a> issues need to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4284.67s">We</a> need to know, and the residents need to know, what is the plan moving forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4289.493s">How</a> long is this project going to take? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4292.355s">What's</a> the end point? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4294.016s">Should</a> they see an end to blasting soon? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4296.478s">These</a> questions all need to be answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4298.319s">So</a> if you could schedule a committee, the whole TANF, all these questions, and I'm sure my colleagues probably have more, I'd greatly appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4306.844s">Residents</a> need to have answers to these questions and we should have these answers as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4310.545s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4922.317s">Excuse</a> me, if I may console appears to you, you mentioned the sidewalk, you talking about the sidewalk from Lorraine to place that?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4940.985s">I</a> was told that there would be I'll go back and read the email because it because city engineer given was it was a <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4948.519s">He</a> said he was working on it, which this sounds like he doesn't even know about it, which concerns me a bit.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4973.233s">Who's</a> that from?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4991.013s">And</a> that's, and that's, I think the reason why we need that community, the whole meeting, so everybody can get on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4996.377s">It</a> seems like everyone, especially the residents, you know, they need to, <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5001.916s">We</a> need to make sure that the residents know what's happening on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5004.957s">They've</a> got the blasting traffic, you know, the police details that are gonna be there or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5009.54s">You</a> know, there's some really serious safety concerns that need to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5013.782s">We</a> need to have a meeting on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5015.542s">And</a> if I may, Mr. Clerk, on my first amendment I made with regard to the pre-blast survey, can you just add in there what addresses were included?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5268.893s">Mr.</a> President, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5270.914s">We</a> just need the signature paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5273.116s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5273.756s">2-1.</a> 
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5326.289s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5327.69s">As</a> we all know, as we traverse the city, <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5331.604s">No</a> matter what neighborhood you go into, there are major issues with regards to infrastructure, potholes, sidewalks, streets in disrepair, and this has gone on for some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5341.873s">And</a> it's really, it has an impact on everyone throughout our community, a real negative impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5349.759s">a</a> quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5351.14s">And</a> this needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5353.66s">And</a> like I said, no matter what neighborhood you go into, it's a major concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5357.482s">So</a> I'm just basically asking for a report back from the DPW as to how the <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5373.27s">So</a> I'm basically requesting a report back from the city administration as to how the DPW is going about filling potholes throughout the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5383.413s">Like</a> I said, no matter what neighborhood you go into, it's a concern, it needs to be addressed, and they are all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5389.896s">So</a> what's the plan that the DPW and the administration is coming up with to <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5397.388s">to</a> fill these potholes and make sure that these issues are addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5401.11s">And</a> in addition, I wanted to add the following question answered by our city solicitor, Mr. Clerk, and that's basically how many claims in the past year have there been for street defects in potholes? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5413.839s">Got</a> that? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5415.24s">Okay,</a> thank you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5491.52s">I</a> was going through some documents with regard to the Encore agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5496.061s">And</a> we have the surrounding community agreement with Encore. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5499.902s">That's</a> been in place for many years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5502.543s">And</a> back in 2019 at the Mayor Burke, there was a committee that was set up. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5508.205s">And</a> the committee was basically the Metric Community Fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5514.486s">And</a> what it did is the casino gives $125,000 a year as part of the agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5521.412s">And</a> it's in section five, the Medford Community Fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5523.613s">The</a> parties recognize the importance of supporting the Medford community and share a mutual desire to utilize this agreement to provide ongoing support to the many important nonprofit organizations throughout the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5536.136s">It</a> goes on to in section 5.2a, an annual payment of $125,000 is made from Encore each year to the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5547.273s">Back</a> in 2019, Mayor Berk had set up a committee that put it, and that committee put a process in place where they were called AIM grants, A-I-M, AIM grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5560.043s">I</a> believe it was All In for Medford, All In Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5563.366s">And</a> those two nonprofits could apply for those grants, the grants were given out, and we would give out the whole $125,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5572.918s">And</a> there was some really, some great nonprofits that received money. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5576.801s">There's</a> a list of them, Mystic Valley Elder Services, Community Cupboard Food Pantries, Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility, Friends of Medford Rowing, Veterans Preservation Project, Medford Education Foundation, Mystic River Watershed, Cache, Trees Medford, West Medford Open Studios, Friends of the Medford Family Network, Medford Farmers Market, and the list goes on. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5599.801s">My</a> point is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5601.697s">That</a> committee has not met in two years and the city has received $125,000 each year. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5608.859s">So</a> that means that there's $250,000 that has come in and no process has been, as far as I know, that committee has not met to disperse those funds or to even get that process going where nonprofits can apply for funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5625.585s">So</a> my question to the administration is what is the plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5629.626s">What</a> is the plan for this committee to meet <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5632.98s">and</a> get the ball rolling with regard to giving out this $250,000 that has come in from Encore Casino within the past two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5641.928s">There</a> are plenty of nonprofits throughout our community that could use this money. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5648.274s">$250,000</a> can go a long way in the nonprofit community. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5651.397s">And</a> there are plenty of nonprofits throughout our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5654.62s">This</a> needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5656.68s">As</a> far as I can tell this, I mean, they haven't met in two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5659.941s">So</a> what's the plan to me? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5662.302s">This</a> money needs to be, like I said, plenty of nonprofits can use this money. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5667.124s">There's</a> $250,000 that could go out. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5670.366s">It's</a> here, it's with the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5672.487s">It's</a> part of the Encore Casino Agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5675.308s">My</a> question is to the administration, what is the plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5678.129s">When</a> is this going to begin? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5680.19s">This</a> committee met last under Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5682.771s">I</a> don't think it has met once under this administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5686.639s">So</a> my question is, what is it going to be? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5689.521s">What's</a> the process where nonprofits can apply and receive some of this funding? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5694.326s">This</a> is valuable. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5695.126s">I</a> mean, this is a valuable source of funds that many nonprofits in our community can use, especially now more than ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5704.815s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5706.136s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5750.846s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5752.968s">This</a> is just to set the record straight. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5754.45s">This</a> is separate. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5755.39s">This</a> is part of the agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5756.351s">This</a> $125,000 comes in automatic every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5762.613s">and</a> none of it has been dispersed. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5764.254s">That's</a> $250,000 that has not been dispersed to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5768.237s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5797.859s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5799.179s">We</a> recently received word that the administration has hired someone to run the parking program, which is great news, but I would like to know, we should, I'd like to receive an update from the administration as to what is the timing of the transition process? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5815.766s">Is</a> it moving on time? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5818.607s">You</a> know, is it, when you think about it, there's only, I think about maybe 72 days or around that period of time before the end of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5828.136s">This</a> needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5831.438s">When</a> I talked to someone at the parking company, I believe they said it was going to be, it takes a while to transition this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5837.4s">It's</a> not an easy process. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5838.581s">It's</a> not like you flip a switch and all of a sudden everything transitions over to the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5844.539s">The</a> administration just hired someone, which is definitely good news, but there is a lot of work that needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5850.944s">We</a> need to receive an update from the administration as to whether or not this is going to be completed on time. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5859.012s">At</a> 1231, is this city going to be ready to take on a parking program? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5862.615s">The</a> city's never run a parking program before. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5865.237s">So</a> I have concerns there. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5866.259s">I</a> just want to make sure that those concerns are addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5868.663s">I'm</a> sure my colleagues have concerns as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5871.669s">And</a> I'd also like to specifically know if the <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5876.621s">Administration</a> has reached out to Republic Parking for an extension. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5881.704s">Someone</a> had told me that the other day, that that's what they had heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5884.365s">I'm</a> not sure if that's true, but they had heard that from someone within the Park Method office. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5890.749s">So</a> I just want clarification on that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5893.19s">The</a> administration said they were taking it in-house, but it sounds like maybe they're not taking it in right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5898.753s">So</a> if we can get an answer to that question, I greatly appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5901.735s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5923.263s">That's</a> fine with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5925.224s">And</a> if I may amend further,
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5929.973s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5930.334s">If</a> I meant further, you know, is a plan unfolds, you know, how does the mayor plan to get input from residents, business owners and chamber in the chamber of commerce with regard to the new parking program? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5943.842s">That's</a> key, you know, the involvement of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5947.124s">So</a> if we can get that question answered, I greatly appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5950.266s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6407.187s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6407.707s">And</a> I thank Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6409.149s">Councilor</a> Marks, you have a lot of great questions that need to be answered, need to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6413.573s">And,</a> you know, I think one of the other questions is ticketing software. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6416.796s">I</a> believe that is completely different from, you know, anything that we currently use today. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6422.521s">But</a> the bottom line is the best question of all, what is the plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6428.486s">What</a> is the plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6429.78s">Council</a> Marks asked it, what is the plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6432.301s">We</a> need to be made aware of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6435.882s">If</a> revenues fall short, if this doesn't go right on time and revenues fall short, that's money that the city probably figures they're gonna be getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6446.405s">If</a> we're not getting all the revenue that we're supposed to be getting, that's a concern when it comes to budget time. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6451.047s">So</a> we need to make sure that everything is being addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6453.567s">And</a> from what I can tell right now, it doesn't seem like much of anything is getting addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6458.805s">So</a> I would actually, I would ask that you please schedule a committee the whole meeting so we can meet with the administration, at least meet through the director of parking and find out what is the plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6469.112s">What's</a> the plan moving forward for parking? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6471.233s">Great</a> questions regarding kiosks, meters, are we switching over? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6474.155s">Are</a> we not switching over? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6475.456s">If</a> you switch over, it's more expensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6477.778s">We're</a> inheriting equipment that's seven to 10 years old, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6481.76s">That's</a> a concern as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6483.722s">These</a> things need to be upgraded over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6486.003s">Do</a> we have any upgrades that are coming up that need to be addressed? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6489.426s">These</a> are questions that need to be asked, and they need to be answered, and the administration needs to provide answers to those questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6495.652s">So</a> I respectfully ask that you set up a committee of the whole meeting to address all of these issues sooner than later, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6502.317s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6707.179s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and if when we have that meeting if we could also invite the parking commission that came up with a report of parking committee and if we can invite them to the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6725.494s">They</a> did a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6726.334s">I</a> have no problem with the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6727.615s">They</a> came back. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6728.975s">They</a> presented this to us previously in Committee of the Whole, but I believe firmly that they should be at that meeting as well to make sure that the recommendations that they offered, see if the administration is going to follow through on those. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6745.18s">So,</a> thank you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6984.779s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, I had the opportunity recently to take a walk through Hormel Stadium and really take a look at the condition of Hormel Stadium and it seems like there are a number of issues that have that really need to be addressed sooner than later. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7001.337s">Among</a> them are the press box I know that there's a hole in the roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7006.482s">I</a> think there's a hole in the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7008.845s">If</a> you walk through the stands there are a couple of issues where the flooring is, they have like an orange cone in the middle of the floor you really can't walk near that so that is you walk through the stadium. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7021.685s">The</a> stadium is starting to show its age. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7023.766s">And</a> if you walk underneath the stadium in the, let's see, kind of the bays or the locker room areas, that's showing its age as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7032.088s">Floors</a> are cracked, sinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7034.689s">So</a> these are issues that really need to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7037.85s">You</a> know, my question is, you know, what's the plan for Hormel Stadium in trying to, you know, at least refurbish it or bring it into a, make sure it's, <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7048.036s">suitable</a> for, you know, I mean, they have games here, of course, and everything seems fine, you know, from a game perspective on the field, but, you know, behind the scenes, you know, and underneath where they, you know, you know, it's really starting to show its age. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7063.52s">These</a> issues need to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7065.12s">They're</a> long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7066.2s">I</a> don't think there's been any capital spending on the stadium for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7071.701s">So</a> my question, once again, is what's the plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7074.462s">What</a> is the plan for when they'll stating the future of Cornell Stadium? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7077.544s">How</a> can these issues get addressed and repaired? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7080.987s">Some</a> of these might be short fixes, but when you walk through and you see that the press box has a hole in the roof, the vinyl sidings falling off the side, I mean, you go outside into the parking lot, the benches are in disrepair. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7095.978s">This</a> is a gateway to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7098.415s">When</a> you think about Hormel Stadium, there are people that are coming in each and every week, because Hormel Stadium is probably busier than it's ever been. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7106.003s">People</a> are coming in from all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7109.206s">This</a> is a gateway to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7110.727s">So</a> when they see the stadium and they see, in some aspects, the condition it's in, you know, I think they really start to wonder, well, what does the rest of the city look like? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7119.136s">And</a> we need to make sure that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7121.402s">The</a> stadium's kept up, and I know the people that work there, they do a fine job. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7125.205s">They're</a> doing everything they can, but there also needs to be an infusion of capital to make sure that this stadium is, you know, kept properly for the long term. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7137.534s">So</a> my question, once again, is what's the plan with regard to renovations for Hornall Stadium? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7143.859s">If</a> we could get a report back from the administration on that, I'd greatly appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7146.921s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7322.804s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7324.264s">This</a> actually is a... <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7328.397s">So</a> feel the dreams. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7329.939s">We've</a> had feel the dreams now for probably about 10 years, 10, 11 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7334.223s">And</a> the life, usually the life of the athletic field and the councilor Scott probably could probably tell me, could probably clarify this too, is probably around 10 years, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7344.849s">Okay,</a> so we're getting into that range now where you know that field probably needs to be addressed soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7351.172s">I</a> know a couple years ago we had a number of people that came before us with the same same question. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7357.996s">And</a> those people actually did a lot of hard work and, you know, getting the field built, and they had the same concerns as to when is that turf going to be replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7369.91s">I</a> know that that has not been addressed in the past couple of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7372.933s">So</a> my question again, I guess, is what is the plan to actually have that resurfaced? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7379.64s">Councilor</a> Knight, you mentioned rentals. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7382.463s">And</a> so there is money that does come in, but what is the plan to have it resurfaced? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7387.468s">And</a> if we can get a report back from the administration as to what the plan is, greatly appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7391.252s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7605.65s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7606.471s">I</a> was up at the Medford High School swimming pool recently and <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7611.943s">It's</a> really one of the hidden jewels in our community to have a pool that big in our community is, you know, most most communities throughout the Commonwealth do not have a swimming pool like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7623.793s">And</a> there are plenty of people that swim and they love to swim and they make it part of their day. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7631.304s">And</a> I was up there recently and one of the big questions that came up was the hot water, it appears that there's no hot water in for the showers in the men's and ladies room and that needs to be addressed I mean a lot of people go they take a swim they go to work afterwards. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7647.837s">They</a> probably don't want to show up to work, smelling like chlorine. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7651.662s">So</a> if we could please have, receive a report back from the, I guess it'd be the school administration to find out why there is no hot water in the locker rooms at the high school in the swimming area. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7663.809s">I</a> greatly appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7666.03s">People</a> pay to use this pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7667.811s">They</a> deserve to be able to take a hot shower before they, or at least have access to hot water before they get home with their day. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7675.335s">So</a> I'd ask that we receive a report back on that issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7678.777s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8370.746s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8371.707s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8372.867s">I</a> thank Councilman for bringing this forward and my colleagues for their kind comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8377.908s">I</a> was absolutely shocked when I found out. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8379.67s">I</a> had just seen Billy a couple of weeks ago at a local restaurant. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8384.614s">And</a> you're right, Council Member, I mean, someone who is so easy to talk to, just a great person, always gave great advice, and someone who will be missed dearly throughout our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8397.526s">He</a> served on the Medford Police Force for many years, over 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8402.897s">And</a> not a lot of people do that these days. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8405.259s">So</a> my thoughts and prayers to his family and thank you.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_IC6Elh6AwZY/2024-11-19_IC6Elh6AwZY.html">City Council 10-19-21</a></h2>

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=751.855s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=752.536s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Biez for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=754.777s">This</a> has been an issue for many years, and I know we've tried to address this in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=759.921s">Crossing</a> at that intersection is dangerous to begin with any time of day. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=766.085s">People</a> are racing to get to the highway, and this is something that definitely needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=771.229s">So</a> I am definitely in favor and in support of this resolution, and I move approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=775.812s">Thank</a> you for bringing this forward.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2425.275s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2426.336s">I</a> want to thank all my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2428.198s">Everyone</a> had valuable suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2431.301s">And</a> thank the residents for coming down tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2433.383s">That's</a> the most important part is you coming down and letting us know what's going on on your street because you're the closest to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2440.649s">You</a> know the issues, the problems, what needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2445.774s">Councilor</a> Bearson mentioned budgeting and budget issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2448.255s">And</a> of course that's always a concern, but safety is the number one concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2451.656s">We</a> need to make sure that that street is safe for everyone that traverses it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2456.138s">Like</a> you said, it's near a school. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2457.979s">That's</a> always a huge concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2459.86s">You</a> have kids coming back and forth up and down the street all day. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2462.721s">So</a> you need to make sure everyone's safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2465.142s">Councilor</a> Scarpelli mentioned the onsite meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2468.453s">I</a> am 100% support of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2470.996s">That's</a> the best way to get something like this done is to have all the department heads on site so you can talk to them, you can ask them questions, and then everybody leaves that meeting knowing what they need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2483.045s">and</a> they hear it directly from you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2484.627s">That's</a> one of the most important things we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2486.528s">We</a> did that in other neighborhoods and it was very successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2489.011s">It</a> worked really well. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2490.612s">And</a> I second the motion of Councilor Scarpelli for doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2494.196s">And</a> I would ask Mr. President, if you could schedule that as soon as possible, that is vital. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2498.68s">And</a> there are some things I'm sure that we could probably do right away, you know, looking at the stop signs, you know, painting stops, lines on the ground, stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2507.368s">That's</a> simple stuff, but the longer term issues like drainage, sidewalks, that might be long term, but we need to make sure it gets on. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2518.833s">We</a> need to make sure that the DPW knows about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2521.354s">I</a> would ask that the city engineer be invited to that meeting as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2525.276s">That</a> is important that he's invited because when we talk about drainage, he needs to be part of that conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2533.76s">We</a> have a lot of drainage issues throughout this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2537.301s">More</a> and more when it rains, there's more and more flooding. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2540.483s">I'm</a> not sure if you have flooding down in that area, but I know surrounding streets, I was down at a playstate in Usher, <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2546.877s">That</a> was like a three foot swell. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2550.319s">So</a> there's a lot of issues that need to be addressed, but that onsite meeting is key. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2555.082s">With</a> regard to council, Mark said mentioned ARPA, there are ARPA funds available for infrastructure projects, especially if we're working on, you know, water main type stuff underneath the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2564.348s">So</a> maybe if it's due for an upgrade, maybe there's funding for that, but we would have to look into that further. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2569.311s">And</a> the city engineer needs to be at that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2571.932s">as</a> well as DPW, Medford Police, Traffic Engineer, they all need to be invited. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2577.74s">But</a> it's key that they're there, you're there as well to ask the questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2582.246s">And</a> like I said, everybody leaves the meeting knowing what needs to be done and what department heads need to work on what. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2588.483s">I</a> would ask that Mister President, if you could schedule that soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2591.904s">We</a> also have to remember that we do have an outstanding meeting with the residents on Cotting Street as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2598.845s">That</a> neighborhood is still waiting for their meeting. <a

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2626.053s">The</a> bottom line is we just need to do it sooner than later. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2629.234s">This</a> really needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2630.534s">These</a> are safety concerns.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2658.428s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2658.688s">So</a> I just wanted to make sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2659.889s">So</a> as far as the offsite meeting or onsite meeting, I should say, so do we have the traffic engineer DPW met for police engineer? <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2667.355s">Uh,</a> disability disability. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2672.679s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2676.782s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2678.423s">And</a> representative of the mayor's office.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2979.774s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2982.676s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2983.816s">There's</a> been many meetings so far with regard to the car park revitalization. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2989.74s">And</a> one of the key, I think, <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2994.718s">know,</a> boards that really should be involved in this is the parks commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2998.422s">And</a> they have not been involved in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=2999.984s">And</a> I'm basically asking that the group that is actually having these meetings invite the parks commission to the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=3007.572s">When</a> you think about at the end of the day, the parks commission knows the needs of the parks, the scheduling of the parks, <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=3014.599s">what</a> the demands are as far as scheduling and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=3018.66s">So</a> they really should be part of this process and in the interest of transparency, they should be invited to these meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=3025.323s">So</a> I'd ask that the parks commission be invited to all future meetings with regard to car park revitalization. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=3032.825s">Move</a> approval.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=3184.414s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=3185.074s">I</a> wanna thank Councilor Caraviello for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=3187.176s">I</a> was in that neighborhood today and you are correct, it has not been moved and it is a public safety hazard and definitely narrows the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=3194.981s">It's</a> dangerous, it's near the school, it needs to be removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=3197.823s">And</a> I thank the councilor for bringing it forward and I move approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=3201.165s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=3536.88s">Okay,</a> there will be a robocall going out?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=3541.061s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=3561.632s">If</a> I'm correct, this is the first municipal election where the residents in three, one will be, will not be voting at LMH. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=3568.976s">They'll</a> be voting at. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=3570.508s">uh,</a> the, uh, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=3573.89s">So</a> I would think that, you know, they should probably get a robocall as well, since this is the first municipal election.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=3808.699s">And</a> if I may, they need to be appointed before the election, correct?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=3826.591s">Do</a> we know if she's working towards the second one?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=3833.535s">And</a> how does it have to be separated again? <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=3835.717s">It's</a> bipartisan, right, if I'm correct?<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_XqTRewGiIAE/2024-11-19_XqTRewGiIAE.html">City Council 10-12-21</a></h2>

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6383.526s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6384.707s">I</a> agree with Councilor Knight 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6386.908s">We</a> should get an updated organizational chart. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6389.59s">I</a> just want to make sure that it includes the names of the people that are serving in those roles. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6395.514s">I</a> know we received an organizational chart during the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6401.481s">You</a> just have positions that reported to the mayor, didn't have the names. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6404.782s">I</a> think it's key that we have all the names within the organizational charts. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6408.623s">You</a> can actually know who reports to who. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6411.084s">Um,</a> so, uh, as simple as task as that may seem, uh, they couldn't get it to us months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6416.045s">Hopefully</a> they can get it to us now.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6538.268s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6539.168s">We</a> were just talking about Firefighter Sunday, and I remember when Chief Gilberti gave his speech this past year, he had mentioned <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6546.933s">that</a> it would be his last speech and that he was going to be retiring. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6550.254s">I</a> think it was going to be November, the end of November. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6553.175s">So</a> this is basically asking the administration to get an update with regard to the transition, how that process is going, and generally just to get an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6565.579s">We</a> really haven't been given any update with regard to this process whatsoever. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6569.201s">I</a> think we definitely deserve an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6574.206s">approve</a> their budget every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6575.967s">This</a> is something that we should know about, and we've received very little information so far about this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6582.61s">So</a> it'd be nice to get an update, or I'm actually asking for an update from the administration that we've received an update with regard to this process in the timeline as to when it's going to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6591.794s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6660.608s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2639.779s">Mr.</a> President, thank you Mr. President, do we ever get an answer as to <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2646.488s">If</a> Michael's voicemail has been checked or his email has been checked. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2650.009s">I</a> know we asked questions about that during the Saturday session. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=2653.25s">Trying</a> to make sure if there's any urgent issues that they get addressed.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3249.841s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3250.602s">I</a> just want to thank Paul McGill for his 25 years of service to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3255.405s">That's</a> a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3256.967s">He</a> will be missed, and I wanted to wish him well in his new endeavor in Wilmington. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3261.97s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4103.695s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and Julian, thank you very much for your artwork. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4107.358s">I'm</a> absolutely horrified that this was not only pulled down once, but twice. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4111.342s">Just</a> completely unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4115.405s">I</a> feel like I'm using that word a lot tonight, but it's completely unacceptable that that was torn down. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4121.21s">And</a> it shows you that there is still a long way we need to go as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4128.132s">I</a> mean, you talked about promoting dialogue and conversation, and that's what it's all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4135.274s">Is</a> it easy conversation? <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4136.595s">No,</a> but we need to have that conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4138.955s">And</a> that outwork, I think, is part of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4141.796s">It's</a> unfortunate that it was pulled down. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4144.917s">If</a> I may ask you, and I was trying to take a note while you were speaking, so I apologize if I missed this piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4151.414s">It</a> was taken out twice. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4152.64s">And</a> the third time was when you. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4157.594s">told</a> not to put it up or sure.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4275.87s">It's</a> just it's just listening to the story. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4278.273s">It's</a> just it's horrifying. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4280.115s">Because</a> here you are trying to do a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4281.937s">You</a> went through the process of getting it approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4285.721s">It</a> sounds like the park commission knew completely what they were approving. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4291.887s">So</a> you went through that process, which is unfortunate. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4293.689s">I</a> mean, it's really, you know, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=4297.648s">I</a> feel like if the administration was truly committed to this, you would have your artwork or to see protection especially not once but having a pulled out twice but you should have as an artist as well receive some sort of support from from I think the administration from the community or that, you know, I mean, I'm glad that you had a pleasant experience with the police department, but it sounds also like there wasn't it you said there wasn't a police reported.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5352.616s">Aye.</a> 
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5694.495s">Councilor</a> Tocco. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5696.377s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5697.117s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Beres as well and Councilor Morell for her words as well on this topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5702.883s">I</a> read through this plan and it actually says this page will be updated regularly as we welcome community feedback and questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5711.79s">But</a> when I've gone through, I haven't seen, I haven't noticed any updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5717.014s">And</a> I think it's important that we do receive an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5719.356s">This</a> needs to be a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5720.777s">It's</a> obvious that this needs to be a priority throughout our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5724.761s">One</a> of the questions I have is who owns this? <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5728.243s">Who</a> owns this plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5730.188s">Is</a> it the mayor's plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5730.968s">Is</a> it diversity and inclusion? <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5732.189s">Who</a> owns this? <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5732.789s">Someone</a> needs to own this at city hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5735.15s">Someone</a> needs to drive this. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5737.191s">From</a> what I can tell when I read through this, it doesn't look like there's one particular person that owns this. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5744.753s">Someone</a> needs to own this plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5746.034s">Someone</a> needs to move this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5747.354s">Someone</a> needs to drive the dialogue and there needs to be dialogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5750.956s">And</a> I think that's lacking. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5753.837s">I</a> know we've had a number of community forums, not nearly enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5758.852s">I</a> think we had a handful over the past 12 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5761.914s">This</a> came out, I believe a year ago, this coming Thursday. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5766.016s">I</a> think there's only been a handful of community forums. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5772.459s">We</a> want to be serious about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5774.22s">Money's</a> going to have to go into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5776.061s">Dialogue</a> is going, needs to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5777.961s">It</a> needs to happen sooner than later. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5781.683s">I</a> thank Councilor Fierce for bringing this up tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5784.925s">We</a> need, we need an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5786.045s">The</a> community needs an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5788.439s">And</a> it's a roadmap, but we need to do better. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5794.744s">The</a> administration needs to do better on this or else it's a road to nowhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5799.507s">So</a> we really need to make sure that this is being discussed on a regular basis and that there is programming built around this on a regular basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=5807.073s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6165.521s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6166.622s">If,</a> if I may just quickly, I just wanted to say, I, Jen, I completely agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6170.686s">Everyone</a> needs to own this, but I'm just saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6174.963s">Everybody's</a> part of this, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6176.924s">But</a> one person at City Hall needs to own this document. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6181.328s">This</a> needs to be a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6182.689s">We're</a> a city of, I always go back to the metrics and about making sure that these departments are separate because, I go back to the metrics, 59,000 residents, 4,000 kids in the Medford Public Schools, 1,000 municipal employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6198.06s">Diversity,</a> inclusion, and equity need to be a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6202.083s">And</a> that's why it should be a standalone <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6204.38s">department.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6205.001s">We've</a> always had a standalone department. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6208.705s">In</a> my eyes, merging it is going backwards. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6211.087s">You</a> look at other cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6213.189s">The</a> city of Lynn just got their first diversity, equity, inclusion office. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6218.315s">They've</a> been waiting forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6220.117s">We've</a> had a standalone office for the longest time. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6224.827s">We</a> voted to keep it separate because it needs to be a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6228.79s">And</a> someone at City Hall needs to own this to make sure that we are, you know, the City Hall is accountable for all the deliverables. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6237.115s">There's</a> a lot in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6238.116s">It's</a> 36 pages. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6239.917s">And</a> there's some good stuff in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6241.798s">But</a> someone needs to make sure it's getting done. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6243.919s">Someone</a> needs to make sure there's follow-up. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6245.44s">Someone</a> needs to make sure that there is, you know, programming here on a regular basis and not just, you know, three times a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6253.123s">It</a> needs to be a priority, not just a check the box where we have a policy or a roadmap. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6259.731s">So</a> that's why I was saying, someone needs to own it. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6262.033s">Yes,</a> everybody needs to own it, but someone needs to be responsible for the document, making sure everything's getting done. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6267.48s">So</a> I agree with you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7592.12s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7594.001s">This</a> here is the property at 15 Maple Park Avenue, the former Bridgewell <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7599.656s">building</a> and the heckner center going back years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7602.42s">It's</a> city owns a property. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7605.846s">The</a> property <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7609.262s">I'll</a> say it hasn't really been maintained that well. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7614.265s">During</a> the summer, the weeds are five, six feet tall. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7619.528s">It</a> looks from the outside like it's in some sort of maybe disrepair. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7623.61s">I</a> have not been inside. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7624.731s">I</a> believe the police may be using it for training occasionally. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7628.432s">And</a> I know that there's been vehicles parked inside. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7631.374s">I</a> think they are maybe former police vehicles, but <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7638.767s">It's</a> an enablement and the city needs to keep up the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7642.188s">I've</a> also been hearing from residents that there's rodents around the area as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7649.151s">And</a> this year needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7651.611s">And</a> the city really hasn't made a statement about what's going to happen with this property, what's the future of this property. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7659.134s">It's</a> just a vacant for a number of years now and it really needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7663.195s">So</a> I'm bringing the resolution forward to just get an update from the administration as to what the plans are for the property and to also just make sure that it's maintained on a regular basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7673.299s">Like</a> I said, it's in a neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7675.24s">Neighbors</a> should not have to look at something that is overgrown every few weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7679.142s">It</a> should be on a maintenance schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7681.303s">In</a> a previous resolution I had regarding this, I asked for the maintenance schedule with regard to this property. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7686.585s">I</a> have not received one yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7687.886s">I'm</a> hoping that I'll receive one at some point, but I just want to, tonight, this resolution is just basically to find out what are the plans for this building? <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7695.75s">And</a> at one point in time, I think it was maybe being considered as an art center, but I'm not sure if any progress has been made in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7702.653s">I</a> know that there is one resident, I believe, that wants to speak on this tonight, but thank you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7882.451s">So</a> that is a great question and that's part of the purpose of this resolution to find out what are the plans, are there any plans? <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7888.896s">You</a> know, as I said earlier, Councilor Marks had led the effort for years on an art studio there, but we haven't really received an update in quite some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=7897.762s">So</a> really the purpose of the resolution is to receive an update to find out what the plans are because we haven't received any updates in quite some time.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8509.416s">And</a> I thank Councilor Knight for bringing this forward and share his sentiments as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8514.159s">I</a> just want to congratulate and thank General Lasky and Judith Murray for their many years of service to our community and wish them well. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8526.77s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8527.33s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8528.39s">Councilor</a> Marks.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8824.93s">Mr.</a> Clerk, I just have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8826.832s">Mr.</a> President, I have a question for the clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8831.515s">So</a> with General Lasky and Judith moving on, what are the plans or how does that work with regard to the replacements? <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8846.331s">And</a> those will have to be, those people have to be sworn in before the next.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=8854.175s">Correct,</a> before the election.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=1328.639s">If</a> you wouldn't mind, if you could get the ranges for each of these CAFs, we'd greatly appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=1333.401s">I'd</a> be happy to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=1333.981s">Thank</a> you very much.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=1981.566s">So</a> that'll be 12 months from hopefully yeah perfect and as far as the uh is there designated parking for this for these units or is it
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3191.181s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3193.721s">I</a> thank Mr. Irwin for coming down tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3198.402s">Thank</a> you for coming down to speak to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3201.043s">I'm</a> sure these last few days have not been easy on you, your husband or your family. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3208.242s">The</a> most progressive value in the foundation of actions and relationship is a truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3215.085s">Without</a> it, we can't possibly move forward to the goal of working together to build a new and vibrant method that we all desire. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3222.989s">I've</a> worked with veteran services Michael Durham closely during my time on the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3228.732s">Mike</a> has repeatedly served the many needs of our veterans with compassion and professionalism. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3235.225s">That</a> is the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3236.966s">I</a> have witnessed the dedication that he brings to his position on a 24 seven basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3242.568s">That</a> is the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3244.129s">I've</a> heard him as sure as, and I'm sure you have to, to be unafraid to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3250.072s">Oh,</a> when he sees an injustice, that is the truth too. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3254.834s">I</a> stand with my Durham who has stood up for so many. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3257.195s">There's</a> one more truth and that's that our city cannot afford to lose yet another one of its best public servants. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3265.023s">We</a> lost a great one just a couple of months ago with Aleesha Nunley Benjamin, a woman of color who left our city after alleged complaints of racism, sexism, and a hostile work environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3276.648s">This</a> must come to an end. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3279.349s">Our</a> employees must be valued, recognized, and respected for their hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3285.991s">Over</a> the past few days, I've been stopped walking through Medford Square, I've been called on the phone, and I've heard numerous <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3295.366s">numerous,</a> all positive stories about Michael Durham and all of the hard work that he has put in, all of the veterans that he has helped, all of the, in some of them during the most trying of times. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3310.276s">It</a> might be paperwork, it might be, I talked to someone recently whose husband was a veteran and he had passed away and Michael helped with the burial and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3321.175s">Michael</a> has always been there for the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3323.916s">I</a> did say during the budget hearing, he's fabulous. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3326.056s">And</a> he is, he's a nonstop constant worker that gets the job done. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3331.758s">And</a> everyone I've talked to, everyone that I met along the way loves Michael. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3338.279s">He's</a> probably one of the finest people you ever want to meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3341.28s">He's</a> always giving back. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3342.86s">He</a> served his country, he served his community, and he's always been there for the veterans of our community and anyone else that needs help. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3351.233s">Thank</a> you for coming down, and I support Michael Durham 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=3354.574s">He's</a> one of the best we've got.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4315.784s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4316.564s">So</a> do you have a standing daily call with the state to go through any questions that veterans may have? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4323.97s">I</a> mean, they shouldn't have to wait to get answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4325.872s">I</a> mean, is this a standing daily call that you have?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4336.898s">What</a> about Thursday and Friday? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4337.939s">I</a> mean, veterans come in, they deserve to get answers in a timely fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4341.542s">If</a> I knew anything about Michael, he was prompt about everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4345.225s">Everyone</a> had their questions answered in a timely fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4348.187s">There</a> shouldn't be a delay with anything here. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4351.13s">I</a> mean, there needs to be a process set up where people are getting answers and they're getting an ASAP. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4356.034s">I</a> mean, a lot of these are very sensitive situations that time can't wait.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4385.856s">Exactly.</a> 
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5239.361s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5242.144s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5242.925s">If</a> I may, uh, who do we want at that meeting?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5389.828s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5390.368s">And</a> if I may, can we also have Darlene come to the meeting as well? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5394.089s">She</a> knows what's going on in the office. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5395.649s">So</a> it's fitting that she's here.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5761.313s">Councilor</a> Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5766.917s">Is</a> this what's currently reflected in the budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5768.999s">Yes,</a> these numbers
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5777.536s">If</a> I look at the budget tonight when I go home, I'll be able to see that the assistant, the actually MCM station manager, that number should fall somewhere in that range.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5809.625s">I</a> just want to make sure it's reflected properly in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5812.927s">It</a> is. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5813.747s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5813.867s">So</a> you're saying it is?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5815.288s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5849.79s">Can</a> we take 21543? 21543. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5859.233s">It's</a> on page seven.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5888.835s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5889.596s">I've</a> had a number of neighbors contact me about this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5893.38s">They</a> might actually be online tonight, and we have a resident here as well that would like to speak on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5898.905s">And</a> in that intersection of Cotting, West, North, and Auburn, there are a number of issues going on there with <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5906.373s">people</a> coming down Cotting Street the wrong way, speeding, the lack of crosswalks in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5912.739s">So</a> there are a number of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5914.341s">I've</a> also received it and I believe everybody on this council has received an email as well that I'll read. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5920.614s">just</a> now so everybody can hear about the issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5924.716s">This</a> here is from people that live in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5926.797s">So</a> dear city council members, I am writing with the support of 28 neighbors to respectfully ask that the resolution 21-543 that Councilor Falco added to the agenda tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5937.602s">regarding</a> a traffic study at the intersection of Auburn, West, North, and Cotting Streets be approved and moved forward rapidly. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5945.169s">Ideally</a> also for the bridge just up the street where Mystic Valley Parkway crosses the river and intersects with Auburn. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5952.336s">Because</a> of the way Cotting, North, West, and Auburn intersect, it is often impossible for drivers coming up one street to have a clear view of the oncoming cars from other directions. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5962.926s">Most</a> cars do not come to a full stop at the stop signs, but even if one does, one's view is frequently blocked by either a parked car or just the angle at which the roads intersect. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5974.505s">An</a> example is turning left onto North Street from Cotting. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5978.59s">It</a> is not a simple four-way stop with two perpendicular streets and requires additional support to be made safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5985.053s">No</a> speed bumps are in place to force people to slow down or discourage driving up one-way streets the wrong way. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=5994.198s">There</a> are not sufficient curb cuts for strollers and wheelchairs, and most importantly, there is no kind of crosswalk in any direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6002.522s">Cars</a> frequently drive up both Cotting and West the wrong way, despite the signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6008.365s">This</a> person refers to when her husband in her <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6014.165s">and</a> politely stopped, asked drivers to turn around, that this is dangerous for many of the kids that ride bikes and scooters in the neighborhood, that they're going down the wrong way, they get yelled obscenities, and there's a lot of unfortunate back and forth between the neighbors or the people that are just driving down the wrong way. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6034.162s">Parents</a> with kids often discuss how dangerous the street is when we meet at Cummings Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6039.105s">Crossing</a> these streets with my two children in a stroller feels incredibly dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6044.969s">One</a> has to be hypervigilant, constantly looking in multiple directions to make sure a car can see us and won't zoom across and hit us. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6052.573s">The</a> bridge where Mystic Valley Parkway crosses the Mystic River is equally concerning. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6056.534s">Currently,</a> there is debris from a recent accident scattered across the pedestrians' sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6061.776s">And</a> once again, the guide rail has been severely damaged in a crash. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6065.657s">It</a> seems like these crashes occur every few weeks, making <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6070.598s">making</a> me wonder what factors are making that turn especially dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6075.859s">Lighting,</a> speed, something else, and how can they be addressed? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6078.92s">Aside</a> from the risks to pedestrians and drivers, these crashes must be costing the city significantly in repairs every time the guide rail gets fixed and a crew must come out to ideally clean up. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6090.84s">I'm</a> including here multiple concerned neighbors who live in the area and cross these intersections frequently. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6096.742s">As</a> we are hopeful, a comprehensive plan can be taken up. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6100.644s">Thank</a> you for your help and attention to this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6103.105s">Gratefully,</a> Sophie Ricks, and she lives on Cotting Street, so she's experiencing this on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6109.807s">And</a> then there's also a list of 25 neighbors on the surrounding streets, Cotting, <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6115.009s">Auburn,</a> Northwest, Winter Street, Martin Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6119.392s">So</a> there's a lot of neighbors here that are concerned about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6122.654s">This</a> has become a very dangerous area to get around as a pedestrian, as a cyclist, and as a motorist. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6130.48s">So</a> what I'm recommending is that we, I believe it worked last time and I think it can work again, and that is actually an onsite committee, the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6138.908s">We</a> did that back last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6140.73s">I</a> think it was very successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6142.011s">I</a> mean, as Councilors, we actually all went to the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6145.333s">We</a> were there with the traffic engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6147.595s">We</a> talked about the various issues with the neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6150.598s">They're</a> there every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6152.039s">They</a> experience this every day, and these are major quality of life issues that need to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6158.284s">So</a> I would ask, Mr. President, if you could set up a committee of the whole sooner than later.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6165.059s">On-site.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6166.02s">On-site</a> committee of the whole meeting.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6169.34s">That</a> works for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6170.301s">I</a> think that, I feel like when we did that last time, we really addressed, we addressed a multitude of issues in the neighborhood that we went to. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6177.263s">I</a> feel like, you know, we worked together really well on that with the traffic engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6181.844s">And</a> I think we can do the same thing down here. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6183.704s">Get</a> everybody on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6184.885s">If</a> we could have it at the intersection of Auburn, North Cotting and West, that would be ideal. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6190.986s">There's</a> many, there are many issues that need to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6194.009s">I'm</a> sorry, I would ask that we have, if you could please schedule that community hall meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6198.11s">And</a> I know there was a neighbor that would like to speak as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6200.15s">So</a> I'd love to, we'd love to hear from you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6202.891s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6530.077s">We</a> usually do Saturday, because that's when most of the neighbors usually can come to something like that, and everybody can give their input.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6593.151s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6666.865s">Interesting</a> area because there is actually like a small island between those two streets that you really, there's a cut through that can't really be used anymore.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6738.458s">Let's</a> see if we can get the city to do it first.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6743.061s">Mr.</a> President, if I may, is there anyone on the call? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6746.203s">Can</a> you see if there's anyone on the call that may want to speak on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=6748.445s">I</a> know there were some people, I think, that were going to log in.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=7169.114s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=7172.01s">Thank</a> you very much and I thank Council Knight for offering this resolution tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=7176.914s">We'd</a> like to congratulate the Leonis as well on their 50th anniversary. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=7181.398s">Happy</a> anniversary and best wishes. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=7183.739s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12185.361s">Mr.</a> President, and I want to thank Councilor Marks because I share those same concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12191.184s">Here</a> we are, it's September, this is going to transition over in January, and there are some major concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12197.707s">This</a> isn't, you don't just flip a switch and it goes over. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12201.669s">There's</a> all kinds of, you know, implications with regard to software, policies, procedures, who's going to run it, who's going to manage it, what's happening with the cash, what are the policies behind that? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12211.634s">There</a> are all kinds of issues with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12214.974s">And</a> if it doesn't transition correctly, there are going to be some pretty significant ramifications with regard to revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12222.496s">I</a> mean, if the city's counting on revenue to maintain revenue, and this doesn't go off without a hitch, that's going to be a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12232.538s">So</a> I share those same concerns, and I thank you for bringing that forward to Council Marks.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12601.443s">These</a> issues need to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12602.764s">It'd</a> be nice to have a community hall meeting where we could actually point out these particular areas and at least give the engineer somewhere to look and come up with a plan or try to determine what the issue is moving forward so people are not having flooded basements just with the, you know, when it's, sometimes the rain's not even bad and they're getting flooding out.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12638.689s">Both.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12640.17s">Approval</a> in Committee Hall, because I'd like the engineer to get started on it, but I think we should have a meeting as well.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12741.246s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12743.302s">If</a> I may, can we also add, in addition to the engineer, can we also have a DPW there as well? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12748.825s">Maybe</a> Steve Tanaglia, he seems to have a good, talking about institutional knowledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12753.087s">I</a> know he has a very good background as to where things usually flood and don't flood. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12758.51s">And</a> I think he'd be able to add a lot of value in that conversation.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12802.634s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12804.036s">This</a> is a similar situation up on Cedar Road recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12808.602s">They</a> had probably about two weeks ago, three weeks ago, a bad rainstorm and the water, the way that they were situated, they have two roads that, well actually the road just kind of <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12820.579s">dips</a> at that one point, and there was significant flooding. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12824.582s">A</a> number of the neighbors had probably a good two, three feet of water in their basements, and some of it actually went out into the backyard as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12832.967s">And</a> this is a similar situation where this needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12836.91s">I</a> just want to, if we can add this probably to, if we can add this address to the committee, the whole list. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12842.526s">That</a> would be perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12845.328s">City</a> engineer can look into that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12848.369s">And</a> I think in this situation, this particular situation, this is an area where at one point the road stopped years ago and then they added on, so I don't think the infrastructure can really handle the newer part of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12864.73s">and</a> Jim will be able to answer that best. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12866.231s">So</a> if we could add this to the list of streets for the community hall meeting and move approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12872.533s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=13115.014s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=13116.474s">I</a> also wanted to echo the sentiments of Councilor Marks and thank Officer Leone and Sergeant Bodo for the continuous commitment to the community and thank them for their many years of service and wish them well in their retirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=13128.859s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_lsDi8m8_uzU/2024-11-19_lsDi8m8_uzU.html">City Council 08-17-21</a></h2>

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=844.103s">You</a> didn't have to do that, but thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=846.025s">That</a> was it.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1457.68s">Mr.</a> President, I'd like to move approval on that motion.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1730.217s">Councilor</a> Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1730.917s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1731.677s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1732.938s">She</a> had a question regarding Ward 2, Precinct 2. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1735.878s">I</a> know that will be moving <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1738.414s">voting</a> usually takes place at St. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1741.417s">Francis</a> Parish. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1743.478s">I'm</a> sorry, 2-1, I apologize, I'm looking at the wrong page. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1745.54s">2-1,</a> usually occurs at St. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1748.042s">Francis</a> Parish and now it's at the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1750.204s">I</a> believe you had mentioned earlier that there's going to be a mailing going out to the residents of that change. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1755.288s">Do</a> you know what dates those mailings will be going out?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1778.504s">They</a> went out today, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1779.364s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1779.965s">Is</a> it just one round of postcards? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1781.325s">Are</a> there going to be multiple mailings?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1806.12s">One</a> round of postcards and two robocalls.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=1809.043s">Per</a> election.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3292.701s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and miss Gail, thank you so much for your presentation and the clerk as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3298.563s">And</a> we've been talking about advertising elections for a while, and it's it's great to see that this is occurring, and it's, you know, it's I said we're reaching out trying to engage people, and you know being part of the process of voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3312.189s">I</a> for one, I completely understand the rationale for. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3316.318s">reducing</a> the number of days, but for me, I like to see that this flexibility, so I would be in favor of keeping the four days in person early voting as stated here, the 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th for the preliminary. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3331.596s">That</a> would be <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3334.105s">I</a> think it's great that we have the flexibility, especially with concerns of COVID and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3339.327s">If</a> someone's weary, they had the flexibility of coming over a multiple number of days. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3345.309s">So</a> I think four days is ideal, and I would be in favor of the four days. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3349.891s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3350.811s">Through</a> the chair, thank you, Councilor Thompson.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3492.344s">So</a> the motion is to reduce it to two?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=3616.145s">So</a> this is to reduce from four to two, for the preliminary.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5429.301s">If</a> I'm correct, though, with this paper here, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5433.089s">These</a> are the recommendations for approval by the city engineer.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5593.636s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5594.676s">It's</a> not a question for Ghalam. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5598.038s">I</a> believe last time we <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5599.948s">In</a> the last meeting, we asked for some guidance on, I think, point number seven.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5607.695s">Okay,</a> if we could hear from Ellen with regards to point number seven, I'd greatly appreciate it.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5797.541s">Councilor</a> Falco.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5801.503s">When</a> I look at this here, this is a recommendation that has been made by the city engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5806.285s">So</a> the city engineer must know of some community that is taking this type of action currently. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5814.389s">So</a> I think we need to either reach back to him <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5816.873s">and</a> find out what community is going through this process and how do they arrive at the fee that they charge the particular company in that city or town. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5831.019s">He</a> must have come up with this somehow. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5832.2s">It</a> must be done in other cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5833.8s">We</a> need to get more information with regard to how much we should be charging. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=5839.963s">If</a> you guys allow me,

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6668.688s">Perfect.</a> 
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6908.318s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6908.999s">I</a> have a couple of quick questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=6910.981s">The</a> first being, if this is approved, when will the work begin and how long will it take?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7147.241s">How</a> long will this project take? <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7148.922s">Yeah,</a> less than one day's work. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7150.783s">One</a> day's work, okay, thank you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7276.993s">Councilor</a> Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7277.653s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7278.654s">If</a> I may, how long do you think this will take to complete?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7290.117s">Okay,</a> perfect, thank you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7967.212s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7967.813s">We</a> do have a pre-ordinance, I think that just got moved to Committee of the Whole, that we reviewed, I think about a month ago.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7977.496s">It</a> went from the Woodman subcommittee to Committee of the Whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=7982.118s">So</a> it was just voted over, I think it was July 17th.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8612.689s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8613.389s">I'd</a> like to thank <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8615.17s">Deputy</a> Chief Fusco for his many years of commitment to our community, to the fire service, and wish him well in his retirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8622.901s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=8721.454s">Yes,</a> I'd like to make the motion to table those resolutions offered by Councilor Knight until he returns.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9351.193s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9352.653s">This</a> is a simple request to receive an update as to where the investigation stands and when it will be complete with regard to the allegations that were brought by the former CFO. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9364.759s">Move</a> approval.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9377.447s">Mr.</a> President, if I could withdraw the next resolution.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9741.762s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9744.382s">Councilor</a> Caraviello for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9745.943s">I</a> was down in that area the past couple of weeks at the farmer's market and also at one of the MFN concerts, and it is really overgrown. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9755.068s">It</a> needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9756.649s">I</a> saw a parent walking their child on the sidewalk and the weeds were taller than the kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9763.833s">And</a> that's just unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9766.114s">And</a> the DCR needs to do a better job of actually maintaining their property within our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9774.892s">If</a> you go to any of their properties within the city, it's just overgrown, and it has been mowed in ages, and we always have to ask for it to be mowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9786.037s">It's</a> never mowed on its own. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9787.858s">So</a> if I could amend the resolution to get some sort of a maintenance schedule from DCR as to how often they come to our city to maintain their properties, because to me, it always seems like they're not maintaining them unless we're asking, and they should be able to manage that on their own, <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=9805.742s">without</a> us getting involved but I want to see some sort of maintenance schedule so if the Councilor would allow I'd like to amend the resolution.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10078.475s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10079.795s">I'd</a> also like to thank, well, congratulate Michael McDevitt-Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10083.197s">It's</a> hard work with the veterans and congratulate him. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10088.233s">Congratulate</a> him for being named with the honor that Councilor Scott mentioned earlier, and I wanted to thank him for all his hard work with regard to the veterans in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/lsDi8m8_uzU&t=10097.5s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_sPI3fdyUva8/2024-11-19_sPI3fdyUva8.html">City Council 07-13-21</a></h2>
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=469.324s">Correct.</a> 
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=470.464s">But</a> there's no one on the line from the administration to answer these questions.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=831.6s">Are</a> we continuing to get that information that Councilor Knight referenced?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=843.789s">I</a> just wanna make sure we're all on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=846.271s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1424.869s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1470.397s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1471.537s">Tim,</a> quick question regarding Councilor Abuerez had mentioned previously the recommendations of number six and number seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1478.521s">So</a> do you know if this has been done in any other cities and towns in the past?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1516.906s">Are</a> you familiar with the structure of what they've done in the past, like the City of Boston?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1528.794s">I'm</a> looking at this because reasonable is kind of arbitrary as far as what's reasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1532.857s">And</a> if we're looking to come up with a fee, <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1538.137s">you</a> know, it'd be good to have some sort of guidance as to which way to head on that, I guess.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1543.961s">Exactly,</a> exactly. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1544.822s">I</a> mean, is it a yearly fee? <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1547.224s">Is</a> it a one-time flat fee? <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1549.045s">That</a> type of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1550.606s">I</a> think it's something that needs to be looked at.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1573.71s">I</a> agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1574.13s">I</a> think it's a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1575.47s">I'm</a> just looking for in the past, if we've done something like this, and because I don't remember doing something like this since I've been on the council, maybe I could, I don't think it comes up that often, but I'm just wondering, and I'm not sure if some of the senior councilors might have recommendations as to which way to head on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1596.892s">If</a> we've done this before in the past, what have we charged?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2555.162s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2556.002s">I</a> just wanted to thank Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin for her many years of service to our city as the budget director and CFO. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2564.466s">She</a> made a number of great contributions here to our city and with the budget process. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2573.829s">She</a> was always available to answer questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2575.851s">It</a> was a pleasure to work with her and I just wanted to wish her well in her new role in all of her future endeavors. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2581.814s">So</a> I just want to say congratulations, good luck and best wishes to Aleesha Nunley-Bedger.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2926.156s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2927.176s">And</a> this resolution is related to the last resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2930.958s">As</a> we all know, Alicia Dudley Benjamin recently left this position. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2935.72s">And</a> my question basically is to the administration, what is the plan moving forward for this role? <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2942.923s">Alicia</a> held the role of financial director, CFO, auditor, and I know she also helped out with a number of treasury functions as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2951.586s">And</a> I believe, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2953.287s">it's</a> these are vital, vital, you know, roles to the daily operations of our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2958.991s">And,</a> you know, I think it's our fiduciary responsibility to be asking the questions as to what is the plan moving forward for the administration? <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2967.636s">Is</a> this going, are they going to hire for this role? <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2969.798s">We're</a> full time personally looking, is it going to be on a temporary basis, but we need to have this information. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2976.662s">I</a> think it's our responsibility to ask these questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2979.825s">And</a> I know that the assistant that was recently hired just this year is still in training or was in training, just trying to come up to speed when Alicia left. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2989.032s">And</a> I know he's doing a good job, but we need to know what's the plan moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=2995.298s">And</a> so the question is basically to the administration, what's the plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3001.101s">Like</a> I said, these are vital roles. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3002.642s">This</a> position needs to be addressed ASAP. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3007.606s">It's</a> $190 million budget, $191 million budget, and we need answers to these questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3013.75s">So</a> I ask for my colleague's support and move approval.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3043.646s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3044.386s">I'd</a> like to congratulate Amy Orcutt and her family on this remarkable, very impressive achievement being accepted into the West Point Military Academy and also being named the, let's see, GBL Scholar-Athlete of the Year. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3059.875s">Amy</a> received recommendations from Congresswoman Clark, Senator Markey, <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3064.757s">Senator</a> Warren. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3066.098s">And,</a> um, you know, this is a great achievement. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3069.541s">It</a> should be recognized, and I wanted to recognize it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3072.763s">Um,</a> it's just a remarkable achievement, and I wanted to wish her well. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3077.006s">Congratulate</a> her on all our future endeavors and wish you well at West Point and congratulate her family as well.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3153.343s">Mr.</a> President, if I may, I wasn't quite finished, but I just wanted to amend, invite her down to a future meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3158.788s">I</a> don't believe she's home right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3159.888s">I</a> believe she's off in a training, but I want you guys, if you could invite her down for a council accommodation. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3164.772s">That'd</a> be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3165.253s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3191.325s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3192.105s">Recently,</a> I was walking down Maple Park Avenue, just taking a walk, and I walked by the property, the former Hegner Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3203.213s">It's</a> in really bad shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3204.314s">I</a> mean, it is overgrown with all kinds of trees, weeds. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3208.319s">I</a> mean, it looks pretty neglected. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3210.842s">It's</a> not fair to the residents that live in Maple Park condominiums that they have to look at that every single day. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3216.889s">So</a> I just wanted to ask that the administration please send by the DPW to <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3223.932s">clean</a> up the property, it is the city-owned property. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3226.295s">It</a> should be on a regular maintenance schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3229.68s">By</a> looking at it, it does not appear to be on a regular maintenance schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3234.185s">The</a> residents that live in that neighborhood should not have to put up with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3237.511s">And</a> I'd also like to find out what the maintenance schedule is for this property. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3243.753s">So</a> if I could please get that from the DPW and if we could just have the DPW provide some maintenance on that property, greatly appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3252.817s">And</a> I would ask for my council colleagues support and I move for approval.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3288.2s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3288.821s">I</a> received a number of calls over the past week regarding people that actually <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3295.404s">Park</a> the cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3295.924s">I</a> think it was actually Haines Square area where they were charged numerous times. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3300.667s">And</a> I mean, they basically swiped their credit cards and they were charged like 30, 40 times the same transaction over and over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3309.111s">And</a> it was to more than one person. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3311.031s">So</a> I'd like to get a report back to Park Medford as to what the issue was. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3314.473s">And</a> just to confirm that these issues were all resolved by <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3319.005s">Park</a> Medford or Republic Parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3321.707s">This</a> here is, it's a big concern, especially since the parking operation is going to be transitioning from Park Medford or from Republic Parking internally to the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3333.537s">So</a> I just wanna make sure that these types of issues are, have been addressed and resolved before the city takes on this new program. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3341.863s">Move</a> approval, thank you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3370.627s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3371.627s">This</a> is just to get an update from the Planning Development and Sustainability Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3378.01s">I</a> know during the budget hearings that the director for the department, Alicia Hunt, I know they're really busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3384.572s">They</a> have a lot going on, but I believe they lost Annie Streetman, the planner recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3387.913s">So</a> I just wanted to get an update as to the progress that's been made with regard to replacing her and when they feel that the position will be filled or the vacancy will be filled.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3661.116s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3662.457s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3663.598s">So,</a> Mr. Clark, so when someone comes into the office, into the school to vote,
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3711.932s">I</a> understand that part. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3712.933s">And</a> I just want to make sure that it's as seamless as possible.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3731.226s">Some</a> people might not know the difference between 2-1 and 2-3. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3733.969s">I</a> just want to make sure that it's as seamless as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3736.852s">If</a> I'm correct, I was told that that building is being leased. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3740.015s">Is</a> it being sold?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4596.509s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4597.269s">I</a> just have a quick question while we're under suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4599.189s">I</a> noticed we received a number of meeting notifications about, I believe, ongoing marijuana companies that are coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4610.051s">And</a> I know there was, I believe it was one meeting last week as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4612.834s">And</a> when I look at these, it looks like some of these have Zoom links and others maybe don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4618.241s">Do</a> we, is there any type of requirement? <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4619.742s">I</a> know we're starting to head more with our meetings and all the public meetings do have Zoom links or a Zoom component to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4627.942s">Yeah,</a> so everybody can see in the interest of transparency what's going on and if they have questions, they can weigh in and give their opinions as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4636.024s">And</a> I just noticed when I look at these here, there's two of these that are before us, I shouldn't say before us, they're just notifications, but we've been notified two of these have Zoom links, one of them clearly does not. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4647.788s">So</a> I was wondering if there's any type of requirement, or if you know of any type of requirement as to whether or not there is a Zoom component?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4681.721s">If</a> we could pass it on to the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4683.263s">I</a> just noticed like there's a meeting here. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4684.744s">I</a> believe it is.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4713.258s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4713.578s">Cause</a> I know there was one meeting last week and I don't think that had a zoom like, and I noticed that some residents have been getting notified.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4730.133s">So</a> exactly, just people, residents should have the opportunity to attend these either in person or if they can't via Zoom and it should be an option. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4738.439s">I</a> know all of our meetings have a Zoom component and just in the interest of transparency, people know what's going on, they can weigh in.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4801.727s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4802.628s">My</a> point is just making sure that everyone has access to these meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4806.331s">That's</a> the big thing.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4807.532s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7847.899s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7850.641s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7851.421s">I</a> just have a question regarding the payroll director. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7853.643s">So</a> is that, I know that's been withdrawn. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7855.604s">So</a> does that position still exist?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7876.353s">Mayor</a> Lungo-Koehn, I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7877.534s">I</a> didn't hear that response. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7878.514s">Can</a> you please repeat that?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7896.602s">No</a> one's in that role, but I believe that role was approved in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7900.023s">Is</a> that role changing? <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7906.764s">Is</a> this maybe not going to be a director's position?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7918.626s">Okay,</a> so that'll be addressed in the upcoming meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7921.307s">August</a> meeting, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7923.107s">Okay,</a> thank you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=8298.183s">I</a> reviewed the records. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=8299.124s">They</a> appear to be in order and I will withdraw.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_4FrRjkCyMqA/2024-11-19_4FrRjkCyMqA.html">City Council 06-29-21</a></h2>
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=137.346s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, Patrick. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=138.307s">Thank</a> you so much for all your hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=140.987s">Last</a> year when I was president, we were going through this together and I called you on a regular basis just to make sure that all the technology was working fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=149.95s">And</a> we made that transition from Zoom back into the council chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=155.632s">You</a> were instrumental, be humble, leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=158.493s">I</a> know it took you many hours to test everything out and to get it working. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=163.652s">it</a> was, it was seamless. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=164.733s">We</a> came back, you had everything going, everything working absolutely to perfection. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=169.795s">And</a> I can't thank you enough for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=171.555s">And</a> for all of the hours that you've put in in the past year, year and a half, I know you've been working nonstop, not just with our meetings, but with all of the municipal meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=181.279s">So</a> thank you so much for all your hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=183.7s">Congratulations,</a> good luck, best wishes, and thank you for all your hard work.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2330.541s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2331.362s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this resolution forward and thank Teresa for her 45 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2339.148s">That's</a> quite a commitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2340.069s">So</a> I want to thank her for her commitment to the community and her commitment to the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2345.294s">When</a> you think about it, 45 years, she has touched the lives of thousands of students and hundreds of teachers that I'm sure she's mentored along the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2353.941s">And</a> I want to thank her for her commitment <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2356.705s">in</a> her time and her energy to the community and to Medford public school system and wish her well in her retirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2362.188s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2362.648s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2859.095s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2860.036s">I</a> also want to thank Councilor Marks and Councilor Caraviello for bringing this resolution forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2864.559s">I</a> also want to thank Cheryl for her <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2867.506s">42</a> years of service, like I said earlier, very similar. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2870.809s">That</a> is quite a commitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2872.471s">And</a> you don't see that too often these days. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2874.813s">That's</a> the thousands of students that she has impacted throughout the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2879.477s">And</a> the dedication is amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2883.921s">And</a> I know, like Councilor Scott probably stated earlier, if there was ever an issue, Cheryl would be the first one to call you and tell us what was going on and what help was needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2892.428s">And</a> she was always there advocating for the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2894.864s">And</a> I want to thank her for many, many years of service to the youth of our community, to the Medford Public Schools, and wish her well in her time. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2902.171s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4224.113s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4225.294s">Thank</a> you for being here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4226.255s">Do</a> you know how, so once the contractor gets the okay, do we know how long the project's going to take?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4247.79s">So</a> we're thinking about it by August?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4325.849s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4328.43s">Over</a> the last 10 days, along with my city council colleagues, I have taken actions to get answers because the residents of Medford and the city of Medford employees deserve the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4339.373s">Now</a> more than ever, we must think, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4342.393s">have</a> increased awareness about the dynamics of power and vigorously pursue ways to create inclusive and competent work environments. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4351.701s">Although</a> personnel issues are not in the purview of the Medford City Council, we have the responsibility to the employees and to the citizens of Medford to maintain a community of equity and inclusion and to advocate for full transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4368.472s">In</a> the instances described, Mayor Lungo-Koehn and a leadership team have failed Medford and I will not stand by and allow our talented city staff to be tarnished or degraded. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4378.397s">Every</a> single city council have voted to take an independent and impartial investigation into this matter, requested appropriations from the mayor to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4389.243s">In</a> a public document from Mayor Lungo-Koehn to the president of the city council dated June 28th, 2021, the mayor denied this request because <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4398.299s">It,</a> and I quote, is nothing more than a political ploy. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4405.966s">For</a> the mayor of the state, the council's request to seek an independent investigation regarding this matter is a political ploy, is an absolute insult, not only to the members of this council, but to the two employees making these allegations. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4421.799s">The</a> statement by the mayor downplays the seriousness <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4425.225s">of</a> these allegations dismisses the integrity and reputation of the employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4430.527s">It</a> calls into question mayor's integrity and motivation in investigating these matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4437.81s">During</a> the council's emergency meeting on June 23rd, city solicitor Kim Scanlon was asked to describe the process of how the third party investigator was selected. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4448.615s">City</a> solicitor Scanlon stated, and I quote, made a recommendation and listed down <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4454.95s">to</a> two candidates, and earlier today, the mayor agreed to the first candidate. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4462.232s">This</a> is in complete and total contrast to what the mayor stated in the June 28th letter to President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4468.754s">In</a> that letter, the mayor stated the following, I did not participate in the selection of the third party then or now. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4476.235s">A</a> statement released to the Medford transcript by the city on June 24th, the mayor directed the city solicitor to engage the services of an independent third party selected by the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4488.603s">And</a> you wonder why the council sought to hire an outside counsel and an investigator. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4493.306s">For</a> the mayor to deny the council's request for funds is simply outrageous. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4500.11s">The</a> resolution tonight is basically to get more information <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4503.718s">with</a> regard to the private investigator that was hired by the administration on or before June 23rd, 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4510.081s">The</a> bullets points state exactly what I'm looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4516.844s">That's</a> a copy of the signed contract for the investigatory services, a description of the procurement process used for this contract, a detail of funding source, line item and scope of services to be provided <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4530.762s">and</a> a copy of the city ordinance the city solicitor is relying on as a basis for the procurement and hiring by the administration for this contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4540.306s">I</a> thank you for your time and I move approval.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5074.875s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5076.575s">I'd</a> agree with Councilor Marks as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5078.475s">I</a> have a quick question through you to the clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5083.236s">What's</a> the timing as far as when would you need to have an answer to send a homeowner petition? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5087.397s">I</a> would imagine there's a process behind that.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5677.206s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7222.975s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, and thank you, Mayor Long and Clerk, for being here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7226.677s">I</a> do agree with my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7228.977s">I</a> think I've always been a big supporter of having these services right here in City Hall, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7235.781s">with</a> people that are familiar with that community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7238.323s">I</a> mean, I know KP Law has vast experience in different areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7241.144s">I</a> understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7242.285s">But</a> when I look at the way it's been set up in the past, we had a city solicitor, an assistant city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7248.689s">They</a> were extremely familiar with what was going on in the community, what projects were going on and the institutional knowledge that comes with working for a city for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7262.118s">And</a> I think that's extremely valuable <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7264.584s">And</a> I mean, I know myself, I like to see a city solicitor, assistant city solicitor, full-time jobs here in the law office. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7273.07s">I</a> look at the council now more than ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7275.051s">You</a> take a look at the last two years, three years, four years, go back and you take a look. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7280.134s">We</a> are busier now, helping to draft ordinances and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7285.718s">And</a> the solicitor's office has been very helpful without a doubt. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7289.36s">So</a> I'm not saying that they haven't been, but there's a lot of demand <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7294.165s">for</a> that one person to be at, like council member said, there's all kinds of meetings that that person needs to be at. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7301.069s">And</a> I feel like we need legal help more than ever now. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7304.471s">And</a> if you take a look at what we did the discussions on the marijuana ordinance, we had KP law alien camp. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7310.675s">So</a> it was almost like a duplication of efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7313.037s">So</a> to me, it's like, I'd rather have city solicitors office with the city solicitor and at least the city assistant city solicitor that's helping us out. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7321.842s">As</a> far as the, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7324.036s">the</a> line item for the legal services. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7326.117s">I</a> think, you know, we should have an attorney that helps us out. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7329.639s">You</a> know, there's all kinds of questions that we had during our meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7332.521s">And,</a> you know, we usually don't have a city solicitor here to, you know, if we want to ask a question about anything in particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7340.525s">It'd</a> be good to have someone here in advance if we, you know, if we know something's coming up that night, that option would be great to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7347.629s">You</a> know, the way I look at the way this is written here, and I appreciate the effort, but I feel like, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7353.65s">You</a> know, if it's something that we think we need an attorney for, and maybe if you didn't agree with it, you'd say no. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7360.013s">And</a> I feel like, you know, if we want an attorney for something, we should, as a body, we should be able to determine whether or not we needed an attorney for a certain situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7370.699s">That's</a> the way I feel about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7371.719s">I'd</a> love to see an extra person in the city solicitor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7375.742s">I</a> think, you know, I look at what we're paying KP law now, and we're paying KP law now more than we pay camp. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7383.172s">And</a> to me, that's a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7385.052s">That</a> number keeps going up, and I think it's probably gonna go up over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7389.513s">And</a> as we go get further, it's everything that's going on with the city, there's always legal things that come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7395.015s">And</a> I think that that KP law demand is going to be more and more, and I'd rather see money put into the full-time employees here in the law office.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7762.061s">I</a> think the question was answered, but your original question, I thought you were looking for one attorney.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8197.429s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8199.33s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8201.452s">Mr.</a> Councilman. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8202.412s">Excuse</a> me, is the reduction $81,600 or $60,000?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9007.626s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9008.887s">Continuing</a> on Councilor Knight's point. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9011.008s">I</a> mean, there are many positions here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9012.93s">We've</a> been asking this for a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9015.59s">We've</a> been meeting, I think, on the budget for about a month now. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9018.373s">If</a> you take a look at a lot of these positions, Director of Parking, Parking Enforcement Officer, Facilities Manager, Recreation Facilities Coordinator, I mean, these here, so there's one, two, three, four, five, so there's at least five different positions that <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9037.717s">were</a> presented in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9039.777s">So</a> the caps could have been presented by the administration to this council and passed prior to this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9052.1s">And</a> they weren't. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9054.12s">So</a> it's like, I understand the elections coordinator is something that just came up. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9058.141s">I</a> understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9059.321s">But</a> these here, I mean, these here were part of the budget proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9064.382s">And</a> the budget, I believe was first presented, I think, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9067.413s">June</a> 1st, maybe. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9068.774s">And</a> so these here paperwork could have came before us to prove the cap, or at least get that process started before we were at the point tonight where we're going to be voting on a budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9083.503s">So,</a> and this could have in some ways, some of this could have been avoided. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9088.026s">That's</a> the point I'm trying to make.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9856.401s">Mr.</a> President, Madam Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9857.781s">So</a> as far as the, these caps here, the ones that we're questioning tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9863.783s">So</a> I just wanna make sure I get clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9866.164s">So</a> were these deliberately not sent out? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9871.526s">Were</a> they deliberately not presented to us, like as far as?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9926.937s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9928.738s">But</a> if I may, still, wouldn't you, I would think you'd still send the caps down. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9935.002s">I</a> mean, if this is part of the budget proposal and you know, I have 11 new jobs and I want to put in front of the council, I want to include in the budget, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9942.244s">I</a> mean, I would think that that would still come down to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9945.627s">You'd</a> still send those caps to us for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9949.911s">I</a> feel like that's the disconnect. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9951.753s">I</a> mean, we got the budget, I think it was June 1st or maybe the first week of June. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9957.599s">So</a> I know the budget process is lengthy and you've probably been working on it since February, March, April, May. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9963.605s">I</a> mean, so I know it's a long time and I know, I'm sure, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9967.486s">You</a> know, you have goals and initiatives that you want to accomplish. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9969.547s">And</a> you're like, okay, I want to bring parking in house. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9971.789s">I</a> want to make sure I have a new person in recreation. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9973.93s">I</a> want to make sure that we have a facilities manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9976.812s">Facilities</a> manager has been talked about for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9979.794s">So</a> I would think like those there would have definitely been part of a cap package that was sent to this council, maybe in a pre-budget meeting where you say, you know, this is what I want in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9989.541s">I</a> want to work with the council to get this done. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9992.403s">And</a> I feel like that's like the disconnect, like these here, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9997.51s">It</a> was, in my eyes, there was plenty of time to get these to come to us before we got to the point where we had to vote on this tonight.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10630.483s">And</a> I want to thank my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10632.144s">I</a> know everyone has different thoughts on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10635.508s">But</a> I know with this here, I mean, this is a 305, 306-page budget book. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10640.812s">A</a> lot of time, a lot of effort, a lot of work goes into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10644.376s">And</a> the way I look at it is this is the administration's plan to move the city forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10652.84s">confidence</a> in the plan, it's gotta be a full package and they have to wanna work with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10657.101s">So</a> it's like, I understand there could be a line item B, I get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10661.322s">But</a> at the end of the day, it's gotta come with a cap. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10665.043s">It's</a> gotta come with a 10 caps, 11 caps, whatever it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10668.624s">So</a> we can work together, we can know what's the plan and what do we need to do to move the process forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10676.426s">If</a> you get a budget with no caps, it's kinda like, well, you got a budget but, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10682.28s">We're</a> hoping you approve the jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10684.782s">So,</a> I mean, the way I look at it is there's gotta be confidence here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10687.685s">This</a> is the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10688.966s">These</a> are the caps. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10689.927s">This</a> is our plan to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10692.089s">And</a> that's the message I'm not getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10695.952s">The</a> caps need to be approved before the budgets. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10700.676s">I</a> mean, I feel strongly that the caps do have to be approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10708.19s">I</a> mean, I've only been on a council for six years. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10710.411s">That's</a> the process that I know. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10712.113s">That's</a> a process I'm familiar with. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10713.573s">That's</a> the right way to go about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10715.775s">I</a> mean, last year when we went through the process with the caps, someone was being paid out of cap. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10720.918s">We</a> voted it down and they're still being paid out of cap from what I know. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10727.062s">And</a> I don't want to go down that road again. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10730.564s">Because</a> every time we mentioned it, that person's still getting paid out of cap. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10736.455s">No</a> correction has been made as far as I know, unless my colleagues know of something else. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10742.257s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11019.158s">It</a> mentions such a comprehensive.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11038.38s">Such</a> a comprehensive review can take place as part of the planned salary study to be pursued through the Commonwealth Community Compact Grant Program, which will assist to untangle this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11048.645s">Do</a> we know when that's happening?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11116.246s">So</a> we qualify, but we don't know if we have the grant yet, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11119.323s">That's</a> correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11121.004s">So</a> we don't have it yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11123.124s">We</a> haven't received the grant to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11125.425s">No,</a> that's just a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11127.086s">So</a> it's a plan, we're hoping to do this.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11133.889s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11139.691s">Mr.</a> Clerk.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11378.53s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11378.89s">It's</a> a quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11379.81s">Councilor</a> Bears mentioned, I think there was a line item for, was it trees? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11386.212s">There</a> was an increase in, was it trees that you mentioned?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11402.654s">because</a> when we had the budget hearings, I believe Councilor Marks, I believe you've mentioned that, you offered that as an amendment, but was it just trees or was it stumps as well?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11419.121s">I</a> just wanted that clarification.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13123.444s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13124.684s">I</a> definitely share some of the concerns that my colleagues have mentioned previously with regard to the caps. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13132.006s">And</a> street repaving, parking, I definitely have concerns there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13136.847s">I</a> think Councilor Marks hit it on the head with regards to the budget and how it's, in the future, it's gonna definitely need to be bigger than what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13145.929s">Because,</a> you know, the parking program to handle this size city, you're gonna need collectors, you'll need maintenance, you'll need hearings. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13152.051s">So</a> that needs to be thought of in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13155.012s">Definitely</a> some concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13156.792s">And</a> I remember asking Marianne O'Connor about this regarding <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13161.275s">rodents</a> and rodent infestation. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13163.576s">That</a> there is a big concern to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13166.416s">It's</a> budgeted $13,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13168.777s">And</a> then she was talking about stores that were being baited. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13172.538s">I</a> think it was in the George Street area. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13175.138s">Just</a> that project alone is gonna cost, I think, 6,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13177.779s">That's</a> half the budget for the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13179.559s">So</a> to me, if there's ever extra money, I think that really needs to be addressed because no matter where you go in the city, Wellington, the Heights, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13190.771s">South</a> Medford, you know, I know I get the complaints and the calls with regards to rodents and it's quality of life issue needs to be addressed and we need to make sure that we're safeguarding the residents when it comes to rodents and mice and that type of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13208.884s">Street</a> and stumps, always concerned about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13211.946s">I'd</a> like to see more of a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13215.21s">Information</a> technology, that came up during our budget hearings when we talked to Mike Ferretti. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13219.913s">And</a> I definitely have some concerns with regards to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13222.494s">I</a> think to guide specifically to the training, because it sounds like there's really no professional development. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13227.657s">He</a> mentioned he's paying for his own professional development. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13230.218s">I</a> think in this day and age with regards to, you hear about ransom attacks and all that, that really needs to be addressed throughout City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13241.864s">Employees</a> need to be trained on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13244.025s">and</a> we need to see more money in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13246.847s">One</a> of my other concerns is we're hiring new staff members, which is great, but I know that there are employees within the building that did not get raises last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13259.195s">And</a> that's always a concern and they worked through COVID and they came in day and night, they did all kinds of things, everything that was asked and they should be getting their increases on a timely basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13270.403s">So</a> I think that that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13272.624s">I</a> still think that, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13274.528s">The</a> council needs a legal line item. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13277.39s">Even</a> if it's minimal, there should be something. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13279.251s">So</a> I think that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13281.733s">And</a> like I said before, the employee being paid out of grade, that needs to be addressed as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13290.018s">It</a> was good to see the separation of diversity and inclusion in human resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13293.4s">That's</a> something I think this council has fought for for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13296.783s">So</a> that was good to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13298.164s">I</a> was happy with the decision that was made there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13302.494s">And</a> last but not least, I want to thank all the department heads for coming before us, answering a lot of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13308.159s">And</a> I know we had many questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13310.081s">And</a> the questions were thorough. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13311.162s">Thank</a> my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13311.962s">I</a> think that my colleagues here asked great questions with regard to the budget and really trying to get to the bottom of the proposed numbers with regard to salaries and expenses and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13323.532s">I</a> want to thank Alicia Dunlea Benjamin, who I have called repeatedly over the past month <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13329.323s">for</a> all kinds of questions regarding the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13331.464s">I</a> thank you for your patience and you did a fine job, a great job of answering all the questions and preparing this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13338.689s">So</a> I thank you for all your hard work and your dedication and commitment to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13343.672s">I</a> can't thank you enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13345.213s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13440.929s">Mr.</a> President, can I ask one last question? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13444.071s">As</a> far as the, so as far as the setup for the <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13449.375s">Diversity</a> and Inclusion Office and the Human Resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13456.9s">Madam</a> Mayor, could you or Alicia just explain the set up. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13461.082s">So</a> we have the new role of, I just wanna make sure I have this straight, because then I'll be asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13465.805s">So</a> you have the new.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13636.328s">Mr.</a> President, if I may, before we take a vote, I just wanted to disclose that I have a son that's a lifeguard in the recreation department. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13644.331s">So</a> I just wanted to let you know that.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13686.517s">Mr.</a> President, if I may, before I vote, I am in full agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13693.943s">I</a> think it's a good school budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13695.464s">I</a> like the school budget a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13697.665s">I</a> have some disagreements throughout the rest of the budget, but I definitely like the school budget, but I would be voting against the budget because the other issues that I had mentioned previously.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13935.926s">Did</a> we just approve all those? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13937.046s">23rd,</a> 24th, 26th.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13942.608s">Just</a> one, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13943.428s">There's</a> three different committee reports, am I correct?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13959.377s">Then</a> what about the meetings with regard to the special sessions that we had?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13993.048s">So</a> with regard to those, are they going to be voted on? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=14000.693s">They've</a> been emailed, but are they on the agenda? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=14003.615s">They're</a> not on the agenda?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=14046.327s">So</a> if I may, on the records for the emergency meeting, are we taking any further action or is it just dying?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=14127.99s">So</a> that means?

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=357.713s">to</a> executive session for the reason that was stated earlier, we would have to give the people that are going to be discussed, individuals 48 hours notice, which means that the earliest we could go into executive session is Friday, Thursday, Friday.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1159.35s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1161.952s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1162.472s">Councilor</a> Belco. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1163.773s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1164.973s">So</a> could we, if we wanted to make a motion to hire outside legal help tonight?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1175.807s">And</a> then it would be up to the mayor to secure the appropriation to actually go out and hire.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1184.93s">So</a> we would, if I may, and I apologize for interrupting. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1187.671s">So</a> we would at least be making some progress towards getting to that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1191.233s">We</a> would have outside legal help to help us down this road. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1196.875s">If</a> we did that, at least did that piece tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1199.847s">waiting</a> for the appropriation that comes from across the hall, I guess, but I'm not sure how long that would take, but it sounds like we could at least go in that direction if the council wanted to, if I'm understanding that correctly.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1252.894s">That's</a> correct.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1255.395s">If</a> I may. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1256.715s">Could</a> you tell us how that process began or how that started.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1691.7s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1693.22s">If</a> we wanted to, could we just refer to a government agency?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1700.082s">Like</a> right here, right now?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1711.243s">But</a> couldn't they conduct their own investigation?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1715.344s">I</a> mean, I think that's what, if I'm correct, government agencies have divisions that are usually there for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1720.646s">That's</a> their purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1723.628s">So</a> when I look at this here, we all have the information that was given to us, that was emailed to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1732.912s">And</a> so, I mean, I look at there, I think a number of options have an independent investigation, which sounds like something like that is already about to begin. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1744.038s">That</a> wasn't originated here by the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1749.243s">I</a> heard there's a lot of talk of doing that, it sounds like. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1751.945s">But</a> the other option is just moving this right out to a government agency. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1761.412s">To</a> me, that seems like it's an option. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1762.993s">And</a> if I may just finish really quick, because when I look at this here, I feel like we have data, we have information, and I feel in some ways we're complicit by not acting on the data that we received. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1778.064s">And</a> I do feel that <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1780.009s">and</a> there is some aggravation that we should have been, not prepared, but there should have been a meeting tonight to discuss all of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1789.818s">And</a> I understand the open meeting law and whatnot, but I also feel like I do have concerns, ongoing concerns, and I'm trying to be careful how I say this so I don't violate anything with what's going on in the four walls here. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1804.591s">So</a> that's why I'm thinking, <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1806.546s">If</a> that's an option to outsource this to a government agency and that's what they do, we should think of that.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=3201.949s">Can</a> I ask one last question? <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=3203.43s">It's</a> actually for the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=3209.375s">If</a> I may, I believe you mentioned that there was an attorney already hired to spearhead an investigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=3220.745s">So</a> with that attorney that was hired <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=3226.838s">How</a> do we know that there aren't any conflicts in the hiring, I guess? <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=3232.322s">Okay,</a> so you did the due diligence to just go through the process and make sure that they had no conflicts with regard to what they were going to be investigating and who they were going to be investigating.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=3293.954s">If</a> I may, if I may, Councilor Bears, could you? <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=3298.298s">Councilor</a> Bears, if you could please repeat that question, I didn't quite hear it.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_SOB2SCGe10A/2024-11-19_SOB2SCGe10A.html">City Council 06-22-21</a></h2>

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3407.842s">No</a> timetables or anything?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3540.679s">No,</a> I want to thank Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3542.901s">I</a> agree a hundred percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3543.841s">I</a> mean, this is not even July yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3545.643s">It's</a> still another eight to 10 weeks of summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3548.004s">This</a> needs to be dealt with right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3549.365s">So</a> I would agree with my colleagues.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3553.529s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3553.789s">I'd</a> love to hear from some of the residents if you want to speak about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SOB2SCGe10A&t=3557.451s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2456.258s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2457.058s">Thank</a> you, Vice President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2459.299s">Received</a> numerous calls regarding this issue and would like to receive a response from the management company with an explanation, basically an explanation of what happened and a timeline as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2470.903s">This</a> is a very dangerous situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2473.764s">As</a> we know, there are many seniors that lived in that building and many people were negatively impacted by the excessive heat. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2481.026s">And</a> we wanna make sure of course that this is, <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2484.543s">you</a> know, prevent it and it doesn't happen again. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2486.544s">So</a> I just want to get an update from the management company to actually find out exactly what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2494.289s">So</a> if we could do that, I'd greatly appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2497.731s">And</a> also we can also get a, actually if we can amend it to see what measures we're taking from the board of health with regard to the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2507.436s">I</a> know that cooling stations, I believe were opened, but I believe it was opened <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2511.273s">They</a> were open on the Monday after this. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2513.533s">And</a> if this happened on a Friday, why was there a delay? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2517.114s">The</a> city should have stepped in to make sure that our residents are safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2521.215s">And</a> cooling stations are great, but they need to be open. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2525.536s">And</a> they need to be open at hours when people need them as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2528.717s">And</a> in some instances, an instance like this, this was a really serious situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2533.678s">It's</a> a situation that's probably 24-7. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2535.918s">Some</a> people can't live in that excessive heat. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2540.538s">So</a> I would like to amend that to get more information from the airport to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2544.463s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2545.004s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2545.825s">Vice</a> President Knight.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4038.176s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4042.398s">I</a> had the honor to play football for Bud Kelly <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4046.025s">from</a> 1985, 1986, and 1987. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4047.206s">And</a> I remember as a sophomore coming to Medford High School and being on the varsity team, it was quite intimidating. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4057.07s">You</a> had a lot of juniors and seniors that played. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4062.312s">It</a> was a great team in 1985. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4063.472s">He</a> was the head coach. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4067.134s">But</a> coming in as a sophomore, everyone at this council was really hit upon it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4072.016s">It</a> was family. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4072.869s">You</a> came in, it didn't matter where you came from. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4074.871s">It</a> didn't matter who you were, you were family. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4077.694s">And</a> he preached that repeatedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4080.296s">And</a> it was about, you know, family, loyalty, being together, having fun, but also being serious too. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4089.405s">When</a> he had to be tough, he was tough, but he was fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4092.868s">He</a> was fair with everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4095.871s">It</a> was probably one of the, <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4098.567s">You</a> think about, you know, you play sports, you're part of clubs or groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4101.429s">And</a> it was probably one of the most fun moments of my life, you know, young life growing up, being 15 years old and being part of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4109.096s">And,</a> uh, you know, he was the last coach to win a GBL title in football. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4113.94s">It's</a> been quite some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4114.98s">It's</a> been, uh, almost 30 years now, actually more than 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4119.284s">Uh,</a> but he was, uh, he was, you know, I remember seeing him after graduating and going to high school games, you'd see him as the AD then. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4127.331s">And,</a> uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4128.463s">He</a> was just a great guy, always a good friend, and someone who could really make you laugh. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4134.947s">And,</a> you know, he was a great family man. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4136.688s">I</a> remember those games in 1985. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4138.229s">After</a> we won, we'd always drive through Medford Square, pull up on the bus, and I think his wife worked at the dress shop right behind City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4146.994s">And</a> he'd stop the bus after every win, and everybody would be singing the Mustang Spice Song, and traffic would come to a stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4155.907s">And</a> literally he'd get out of the bus, he'd run across the street, his wife would come out and everybody that worked at the shop and he'd give his wife a kiss. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4162.81s">And</a> then he'd come back onto the bus and we'd make our way to the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4166.892s">And,</a> uh, you know, it was just a really fun way to celebrate a victory. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4170.954s">He</a> was a great family man. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4172.194s">And,</a> uh, there was a lot of pride there in blue and white. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4176.817s">If</a> you play Mustang football, blue and white was running through your veins. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4179.878s">If</a> you played any sport, blue and white was running through your veins and he would preach that repeatedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4184.999s">And,</a> you know, the community is, this is a big loss to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4189.463s">And</a> my, you know, thoughts and prayers and condolences go to the Kelly, to Judy Kelly and the family. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4194.627s">And</a> he will, he will be missed.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4548.135s">And</a> how long is your season? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4549.396s">How</a> many games do you play at home?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4565.783s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4566.223s">And</a> I'm sorry, how many, how many games do you play?

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5064.323s">That</a> would be the same for both locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5067.124s">Okay,</a> so 6 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5068.285s">to</a> 2 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5069.385s">for</a> both locations for the duration of the remodel? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5074.227s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5075.728s">I</a> apologize, did you say the remodel was going to be two weeks?

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1519.213s">I</a> graduated from the Sarah Bradley Fulton Elementary School.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1524.617s">Back</a> in the 1970s.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1529.92s">Yes,</a> yes, at the top of Fulton Street.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1535.043s">Many</a> of my aunts and uncles, many of them, they're not with us any longer, but they graduated from that same school back years ago, as did my father.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1547.31s">I</a> do, yes, I do live in Medford.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1550.872s">I</a> actually live on Fulton Spring Road.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1556.437s">There</a> is, you are correct.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1563.46s">But</a> I'm definitely in favor of having a day to recognize you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1567.642s">I'm</a> very happy that my colleague, Consular Marks, brought this presentation forward.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2750.307s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2751.147s">I</a> also want to thank director Durham for all his hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2754.168s">I</a> think a lot of people <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2756.09s">when</a> we're talking about it now, truly do not realize how much work happens in your office and the different programs that are available. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2765.456s">And</a> there's a lot of work, a lot of hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2767.898s">And</a> I know you're very busy and I thank you for all your hard work and for the speech that you made on Memorial Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2775.283s">It</a> does resonate with a lot of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2776.704s">I</a> think it does touch a lot of people and it's important that people hear that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2784.22s">you</a> know, and thank you to, you know, thank you for Council Vice President Knight for bringing the resolution tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2791.662s">Thank</a> you Post 45. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2792.942s">And</a> it's important that those 8,700 veterans are remembered. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2796.923s">And</a> I had the opportunity to, I was actually with Vice President Knight and we did, you know, put the flags down at the cemetery. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2805.326s">And</a> it's quite humbling as you walk, you know, among the graves and you're putting them in the ground and it's, you know, literally you have bags and bags of flags, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2813.974s">you</a> know, that represent, you know, the many residents that, you know, volunteer, you know, that were in the Army and Navy, Air Force, Marines, and you name it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2823.778s">And</a> in many of them, you know, making that ultimate sacrifice. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2828.26s">And</a> when you see that, and you see that the graves and you're walking, you know, row by row, it's, it's amazing that the dedication and commitment to our, to our country into, you know, many of the freedoms that we enjoy today, we have because of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2842.783s">And</a> you think about the 77th anniversary of D-Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2846.426s">And</a> I had the opportunity about 20 years ago to visit the D-Day beaches in France. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2852.472s">And</a> you walk down the beach and you turn and you see the cliffs in front of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2857.617s">And</a> you try, I mean, you can't even imagine that people walking into that and all that fire coming off, you know, all the, you know, you know, just, <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2870.016s">the</a> fire from the machine guns and whatnot coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2872.617s">I</a> mean, they were just walking into pure hell. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2876.42s">And</a> you think about the sacrifice and the commitment that they made. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2881.082s">And</a> it's amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2883.524s">It's</a> just, I mean, to be there and to see it firsthand, I mean, you see it in the movies, you see it on TV and the different documentaries, but to see it, you hit on the head, the greatest generation. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2894.37s">I</a> mean, to make that sacrifice, <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2898.915s">It's</a> just amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2899.676s">And,</a> you know, it is truly the greatest generation. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2902.238s">They</a> should be remembered. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2903.158s">They'll</a> always be remembered. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2905.52s">And</a> you can never thank them enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2906.861s">And</a> I think, in the end, if you know a World War II veteran, if there's someone in your neighborhood, it's important, I think, that you really talk to them and hear it firsthand, if you can, because the sacrifices that were made, you know, you don't see a lot of that today. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2923.877s">And</a> it's really a special generation that will, you know, I think always have a special place, you know, in our country. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2933.32s">So</a> I thank you so much for all your time and your effort that you put in day in and day out. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2939.362s">I</a> know you don't have an easy job. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2940.842s">It</a> is very busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2942.863s">And</a> I thank you for your commitment to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2945.764s">And</a> I thank you for your service. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2947.484s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2947.884s">Thank</a> you for having me here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2949.145s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3951.891s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3952.831s">And</a> so if I could amend the resolution just to have the DPW look into the water spigots to see if they're working correctly just so we can hopefully save that grass if it's possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3963.781s">But</a> I also want to thank Mr. Dunn for all his hard work and <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3967.384s">collaborating</a> with Medford Recreation and with the business community. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3970.385s">That's-</a> Yes, absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3972.385s">It's</a> great to see that you're going from business to business, and actually they have chess sets, I think you said, in each of the- I think we've had a dozen people donate chess sets, and they went to different restaurants.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3991.428s">And</a> it's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3991.989s">It's</a> great to see that I give you a lot of credit. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3993.93s">I</a> know you do this in your own time. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=3995.291s">And</a> I think that that commitment is really something special that, you know, more and more people get that that just go out and try to do things on their own and try to, you know, make, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4006.314s">just</a> make improvements wherever they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4007.735s">It's</a> great to see Riverside Plaza being occupied and being used. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4011.956s">I've</a> gone by a few times and I've seen people playing chess and that's always good to see people sitting and enjoying the space. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4018.819s">I</a> do have one concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4019.64s">You</a> had mentioned briefly something about safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4023.2s">Can</a> you comment a little bit on that?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4072.484s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4073.364s">If</a> I may amend the resolution again, Mr. Donovan, thank you for that feedback on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4078.508s">But</a> as far as the safety goes, if we can amend the resolution to have, could you send the Metro Police just increase patrols in that area, maybe just to make sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4090.112s">People,</a> I don't want people to feel that they can't go and enjoy the park.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5019.578s">Councilor</a> Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5020.338s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5021.678s">I</a> remember Mr. Scopa from my days working for the city as a teenager in high school, and I remember his dedication, his commitment, and the dedication and commitment of the whole family. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5032.981s">And</a> my thoughts and prayers are with him and his family, and he will be missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5037.182s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5511.908s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5512.568s">I</a> thank Councilor Villes for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5514.349s">One</a> of the things I'd also like to know is, you know, in addition to a cost estimate, I mean, how long is it going to take to get all of this in place? <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5522.993s">And</a> the reason why I ask is I know I worked with Patrick when I was president of the council and I knew it took a lot of time, effort and energy <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5531.21s">just</a> to set this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5533.051s">And</a> I'm sure it's probably perfected it by now, but it'd be good to just get an estimate as to how long that will take. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5539.214s">So</a> if I could add that as an amendment, I really appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5542.756s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7961.629s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7962.51s">Councilor</a> Beall. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7963.01s">Mr.</a> President, I'll be brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7964.631s">I</a> just want to thank Councilor Mark for his comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7967.712s">We</a> have, I think, many issues with the MBTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7970.053s">I</a> know I received, in addition to the issue that's going on on High Street, you know, we have issues with the 325, 326 that I receive calls on constantly. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7980.725s">So</a> if Councilor Scarpelli wouldn't mind, if we have a committee in the hall instead of a subcommittee, I just think it should be a broader discussion with regards to the MBTA and the services that they provide here. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7991.229s">Well,</a> I should say the lack of services. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7993.93s">So</a> I would appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7996.071s">We'll</a> make that a committee in the hall.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8814.895s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8815.856s">I</a> reviewed the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8816.876s">They</a> appear to be in the order.<h2><a href="../2021-06-07_tZVXN6zzUHw/2021-06-07_tZVXN6zzUHw.html">Regular School Committee Meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=2620.771s">Aye.</a> 
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=2627.514s">This</a> hybrid thing, should we always have these on
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=2636.646s">Okay,</a> thank you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8057.935s">thank</a> you mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8058.716s">thank</a> you for the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8060.016s">i'm</a> not far enough forward am i? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8065.876s">So</a> a couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8068.098s">First</a> off, if we could have this added to policy CMA, which is our annual reports and presentation schedule, I make a motion to add it to the schedule as an annual presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8081.348s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8085.11s">And</a> then I'll just go through those things quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8088.993s">Also</a> in that policy that we passed in February of this year, I believe, <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8094.78s">We</a> do have a reference to a definitions page that we were going to set up. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8099.163s">And</a> I realize there's a lot of things going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8101.185s">I</a> would just urge us to have a single glossary or like a mandatory glossary. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8107.53s">The</a> superintendent says nobody gets to create their own because, you know, we have definition pages here. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8112.814s">We're</a> going to have a glossary in this document and, you know, definitions drift and change and maintenance is a nightmare when everybody has their own copy of what the definitions are. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8124.548s">And</a> I just, not a motion, just I would urge us to create this actual webpage on our website and then put all those in there so that everybody has a consistent agreement as to when we say, what's a 504, the explanation I saw in the presentation looked good. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8143.118s">No,</a> okay, see, well, I'm not the expert on that, but somebody else can probably come up with a really great definition <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8152.805s">But</a> if you ask me, I'll probably give you a pretty hacked version. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8157.226s">So</a> that would be nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8158.766s">And</a> then on an equity initiative, E3, there's the word equal. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8165.768s">And</a> it's one of those things where I'm not sure in the sentence what is being said. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8172.289s">It</a> says, provide equal access to academic support and enrichment. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8180.312s">the</a> two completely different ways of viewing that sentence. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8183.754s">An</a> equal access, for instance, would be to provide an enrichment activity with a $500 fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8189.318s">Anybody</a> who wants to can pay the fee, that's equal. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8194.341s">And</a> I don't think that was the goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8198.103s">Equal</a> access presumably would mean anybody who wants to participate can participate in the enrichment activity, whether or not you can afford it or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8206.289s">And</a> so I just, I don't know that <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8210.507s">equal</a> isn't the right word. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8212.648s">I</a> just feel like there needs to be a little bit more meat behind that word to make it clear when we say equal access. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8220.494s">It's</a> sort of been the big problem for a long time is we offer all these things to anybody who wants them. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8228.579s">There's</a> all these opportunities with no consideration as to whether or not they are actually accessible to individual students. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8235.704s">I'm</a> preaching to the choir here a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8239.219s">When</a> I saw that, I just got a little bit concerned that when we say that, we mean we're gonna offer a whole bunch of activities, maybe they cost money, maybe they don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8247.981s">And</a> the fact that we offer them is in fact equal, like anybody can participate if you can find the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8256.843s">And</a> that isn't really what I think the intent of that, being on the equity initiative, to me, I read that very, <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8266.195s">is</a> a confusing state. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8267.236s">And</a> you said you were on E3. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8268.757s">I'm</a> just trying to find the specific one. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8270.858s">The</a> Equity Initiative E3. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8274.92s">And</a> maybe there were more E3s. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8277.142s">But</a> if you can just find a way to word it or add an asterisk, I don't know what the right way to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8283.686s">But</a> when we look at the outcomes later on, we say anybody who wants to go on the middle school field trip can go. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8293.652s">But</a> that's not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8297.183s">because</a> we charge a pile of money and so not everybody can go. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8302.965s">So</a> I like the definition of equal where it's sort of an individual, every individual student has the access and that's gonna look different for every student. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8316.01s">So</a> other than that, I thought it was really nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8319.631s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8319.951s">I</a> appreciated the details and I know that it's a much bigger presentation, but we can't be here all night. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=8325.053s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9387.774s">Member</a> Ruseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9392.458s">Mr.</a> Murphy may be able to answer this, and you actually probably can too. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9396.721s">So</a> I've been constantly trying to get a burn report, like how much have we used of the amount? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9401.925s">And</a> it's apparently like a nice request, but without this kind of a system, it's really a huge ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=9411.397s">It</a> should be a click of a button.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11891.955s">Members</a> some. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11893.787s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11894.728s">I'm</a> obviously very excited about this entire project. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11902.194s">We</a> can use our SOA, but we don't get much from the Student Opportunity Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11905.996s">It's</a> an understatement. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11907.998s">But</a> family engagement is, I think, sort of, it's been a long year. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11913.943s">But</a> we have to submit a report every year at what we're doing with our three extra nickels. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=11920.508s">We</a> can use this completely to satisfy those needs, correct?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12354.709s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12356.551s">Before</a> you leave, you mentioned the person responsible for the statutory stuff around attendance. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12366.64s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12370.759s">This</a> past year was a very different challenge around attendance. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12376.001s">You</a> can be in school one period and not the next, or the next. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12381.083s">We</a> had a lot of letters, not a lot, but a number of parents certainly reached out to me about letters that were coming from our district attorney that were quite threatening, frankly. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12390.606s">And</a> they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12391.147s">If</a> I got one at home, I would consider it a very significant threat. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12395.268s">And</a> I realized it was because of the fact the systems did not ever anticipate <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12401.505s">the</a> pandemic and being on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12405.188s">Do</a> those letters happen automatically out of the state-based connections to our attendance system or do we actually have a hand in getting those letters sent from the district attorney?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12482.529s">Yeah,</a> that'd be great, because you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12484.329s">The</a> reimagining, which I couldn't be more supportive of, <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12488.846s">It's</a> kind of like, oh, we're all being positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12492.168s">And</a> then there's this like, feels like an officer at the door is going to take you away kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12497.052s">Like</a> what is going, the letter is so stark, not the values we're putting forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12503.877s">And</a> I would say that if we can have a way to, I'm not saying that the regulatory, the statutory requirements are there for, they are what they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12514.224s">But</a> if we can find a way to, <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12518.32s">either</a> soften it or deliver it differently, or we deliver it.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12589.658s">me.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12591.219s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12591.899s">So</a> I motion to move the November 1 to November 8. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12594.561s">And</a> I don't really feel strongly about whether November 15 can stay there or not, or whether it should move out. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12600.185s">Oh,</a> yeah.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12662.219s">Motion</a> to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12663.461s">Motion</a> to accept. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12664.362s">Can</a> I suggest a friendly amendment, maybe? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12668.486s">The</a> additional text would be <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12670.847s">And</a> in light of the fact that the advisory committee has selected their final three names, we will vote on June 14th for the new name, regardless of whether they are able to present to us as anticipated. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12685.579s">I</a> will, sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12686.499s">The</a> very brief thing here is if they're not ready with a presentation, we're voting on the 14th.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12699.925s">I</a> would suggest we watch the meetings to see what's really going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12704.226s">I</a> am watching the meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12706.147s">I'm</a> not convinced on the 14th of this month or next month they will finish their slides. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12710.728s">So</a> if you don't want to accept my amendment, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12715.589s">And</a> I can read it again one more time in case you all didn't get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12721.428s">Sure,</a> and in light of the fact that the advisory committee has selected their final three names, we will vote on June 14th for the new name, regardless of whether they are able to present to us as anticipated.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12804.887s">I</a> certainly agree that they're spending a lot of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12809.133s">over</a> one hour on one slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12810.673s">They</a> have 30 slides. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12812.774s">So</a> we will be here next January, perhaps. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12816.354s">I</a> mean, it's not that they're not putting enough time in. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12819.595s">This</a> is not questioning that. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12821.475s">But</a> if all that has to happen in that meeting is that some members of the advisory committee can make it take an hour per slide, it'll be the next election before we're ready to have the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12836.238s">So</a> I mean, I've watched the meetings, all of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12839.637s">every</a> minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12840.697s">And</a> what I see is happening is that most of the members are absolutely positively working their butt off to get great slides. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12847.18s">And</a> I also see people who are not doing that, who seem to be discovering that if we can make an hour per slide the standard, that it's not gonna get done. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12857.324s">And</a> I don't know what's in their head, but it's an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12861.866s">I</a> timed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12862.567s">I'm</a> happy to send you the links. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12864.547s">I</a> timed it, an hour for a slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12866.968s">There</a> are 30 slides. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12869.345s">They're</a> on slide eight, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12871.285s">So.</a> 
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12897.692s">If</a> I may.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12899.382s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12900.443s">We</a> can't just decide on the 14th to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12903.204s">It's</a> not on the agenda to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12906.106s">So</a> if you come back and say they'd like another extension, one of our options is not to pick a name that night, because that's not on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12915.011s">So</a> tonight is our only opportunity to decide that on the 14th, we will vote for a name. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12923.737s">If</a> they submit to you and don't give you the presentation and say, I want to be in the agenda, then we're not voting <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=12930.488s">we</a> as a committee have no control over when we actually get to vote.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13269.763s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13306.397s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13307.477s">I'm</a> so happy everybody wants me to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13309.218s">I</a> know. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13309.779s">I</a> just wanted to say, I've already done some research about our communities and nobody seems to do, just take all the community letters and just stick them into the minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13319.063s">And</a> I think that it's, the pandemic's been going on, we have certainly received a number of letters, not that many at all, that we should all feel very uncomfortable to have in the official minutes of the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13331.81s">that</a> the Medford School Committee in perpetuity, things that member of Andrew Kluge, for instance, would not read out loud and should not read out loud, should not be a part of our permanent record. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13341.696s">So</a> it sounds like there's already plenty of motions on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13345.678s">So</a> I'll stop talking.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13348.8s">Second,</a> yes.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13409.833s">I</a> just wanted to make a motion to send this <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13417.549s">policy</a> to the rules policy and equity subcommittee for some formatting and all the proper stuff to be added in an update.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13427.533s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13457.893s">I</a> mean, this is an advisory committee based on the motions we used to create it initially. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13465.096s">So</a> I don't have any problem with a bunch of work being done ahead of time so we can get the advisory committee set up. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13472.36s">Hopefully</a> it will not be <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13474.073s">meeting</a> like our last advisory committee set up, but we still do need to do all of the items in our advisory committee policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13482.199s">How</a> long is the service? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13483.581s">How</a> many members? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13484.942s">How</a> will they be selected? <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13487.143s">That's</a> policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13489.325s">So</a> I don't have any problem with the administration beginning the work to figure out all of that stuff, but the school committee has the sole authority to constitute an advisory committee <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13503.547s">And</a> so I would support this if the end goal here is that a recommendation from the administration comes on how that will happen, and then we can have our meeting to do it.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13530.907s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13533.402s">So</a> there won't be like picking members or anything going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13537.283s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tZVXN6zzUHw&t=13539.904s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_JjIkY7Z2rzw/2024-11-19_JjIkY7Z2rzw.html">City Council 06-01-21</a></h2>
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=405.157s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=406.057s">Thank</a> you for opening a business here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=409.538s">A</a> couple of quick questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=413.08s">Do</a> you have the hours of operation?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=446.647s">And</a> as far as, I'm looking at the paperwork for the next hearing to, will you be servicing vehicles at this facility?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=498.804s">Mid-July.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=501.685s">And</a> you mentioned it earlier, I missed this, how many employees at this location?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=514.032s">And</a> as far as I believe, did you say you were adding on to the existing structure?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=550.879s">So</a> the section that you're adding on is that phase that you're preparing?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=2759.854s">Thank</a> you, President Caraviello, and thank you, Marianne. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=2763.548s">have</a> a quick question now. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=2764.588s">So</a> we're going to are we still doing contact tracing?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=2819.849s">Do</a> we do any type of contact tracing at the library?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=2852.601s">So,</a> I mean, it seems like there's a little bit of an inconsistency. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=2854.802s">I</a> mean, wouldn't we have the contact tracing at the library as well as city hall? <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=2858.163s">I</a> mean, there's people coming and going on a pretty frequent basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=2861.764s">I</a> would think there would be a consistent policy with regards to that.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=2891.914s">So</a> we don't know if there's contact tracing at the library? <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=2894.515s">The</a> administration does not know.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=2901.378s">You</a> don't know, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=2902.898s">So</a> we have contact tracing at City Hall, the administration knows that.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=2911.522s">The</a> administration does not know if there is contact tracing at the Metropolitan Public Library.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3526.365s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3527.325s">Derek,</a> I just want to say congratulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3529.646s">I</a> know that earning the rank of Eagle is quite, quite a remarkable accomplishment. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3535.79s">If</a> you take a look at just Google, <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3538.765s">Eagle</a> Scouts, you'll see it's a very, very impressive list of people that have earned that rank. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3545.15s">And</a> you're one of them now. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3545.971s">You're</a> part of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3546.651s">It's</a> an exclusive group. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3548.593s">And</a> I'm very proud of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3550.955s">I</a> know that your parents are very proud of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3553.016s">And</a> of course, it takes a lot of support from your parents and your family. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3556.859s">And</a> I just wanted to just congratulate you on all the time, the commitment, the dedication. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3563.645s">It</a> takes a lot of hard work and great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3566.967s">Good</a> luck in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=3568.579s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4029.786s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4031.557s">During</a> my past four visits to get gas for my car, I've looked at the seal on the gas pump. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4038.499s">It</a> indicates the date when the pump was last inspected by the city's sealer of weights and measures. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4045.562s">Frankly,</a> I've been shocked by how long it has been since these pumps were looked at by the city sealer of weights and measures. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4052.884s">In</a> some cases, it has been as long as three, four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4058.148s">For</a> people who don't know, the City Stealer of Weights and Measures is the city employee appointed by the mayor who checks the accuracy of pumps at the gas station, scales at food stores, in the deli or produce departments, or anything that a merchant uses to measure goods that are being sold to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4075.173s">If</a> these pumps or scales are not accurate, the customer will pay more for the gas that they buy for their car or the fruit or cold cuts that they buy for their family. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4084.341s">Pumps</a> and scales that have been unchecked or not properly calibrated by the city ends up with people paying more than they should pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4092.485s">And</a> what is worse, they will never know it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4097.267s">Anytime</a> this happens, it is obviously unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4101.309s">But</a> if it happens because the city has not done its job, it shows a callous disregard for a hardworking residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4109.553s">So</a> Mr. President, in addition to the requesting a full list for entities that zero <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4114.925s">In</a> addition to requesting a full list for entities that sealer of weights and measures monitors in the date of last inspection and expiration of seal. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4123.952s">I</a> also ask that the mayor advise this council who the sealer of weights and measures is, and when he or she began in that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4132.279s">This</a> is something that, you know, even with COVID could have been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4137.803s">And</a> as far as I can tell, and I've traveled to numerous gas stations throughout the city, <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4143.994s">just</a> to do my own research, I went to probably six to eight gas stations and they're all expired. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4150.72s">This</a> needs to be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4152.361s">And</a> I also believe that this is a revenue source for the city that they're not taking in. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4156.725s">So</a> this is lost revenue to the city, but it is completely just unfair to the taxpayer that actually buys gas on a regular basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4165.913s">And</a> we all do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4167.454s">So</a> on that, I'd like to move approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4169.736s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4394.016s">To</a> find out what the fee is for each of the inspections. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4399.667s">to</a> gas inspections, scale inspections at the supermarket. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4405.149s">If</a> I can amend to include that.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4644.93s">That's</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4646.271s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4647.912s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4649.774s">A</a> couple of quick questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4650.875s">When</a> will the work take place?

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4888.703s">I</a> just wanted to know if there are any plans to put 5G on that telephone pole, and if you could get back to us with that if you do not have the answer.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5173.173s">Is</a> there anyone off of the administration to answer questions?

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5513.769s">Yeah,</a> so if I'm correct, that's the latest resolution has been referred to KP Law.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5523.775s">There's</a> no figure, but I mean, the other resolutions, we haven't received any response back, am I correct?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5533.041s">It's</a> been months, if I'm correct.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5586.566s">This</a> has been going on for months now. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5589.227s">For</a> months. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5589.627s">We've</a> asked numerous times and we've got nothing back. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5594.752s">I</a> mean, we've asked the administration at least, I think, four times. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5599.955s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5603.337s">We've</a> asked them at least four, I think five- Does they get to pick which tent?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5610.54s">Well,</a> we've asked at least four times to provide the council with a breakdown of how much the administration has spent with KP Law regarding 40B projects, other projects, <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5623.6s">I</a> know that other councillors have done. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5625.161s">I</a> mean, I've made a number of resolutions myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5627.142s">I</a> know we had a joint resolution, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5630.304s">Councilor</a> Morell has had resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5631.785s">I</a> think everyone behind this rail has had resolutions with regard to this same matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5637.949s">We've</a> been told that the budget will be coming to us next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5643.713s">It'll</a> be coming to us in a few days. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5645.194s">My</a> concern is that how can the mayor expect this council to act on a budget <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5651.114s">which</a> is her plan for the anticipated expenditures for the next fiscal year if she cannot inform the council of the actual expenditures that she has made during the past fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5662.477s">This</a> has been ongoing, we've asked numerous times. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5665.018s">It</a> makes no sense for the council to wait for a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5668.139s">That</a> experience tells us we'll never come. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5672.22s">This</a> council and our taxpaying residents deserve more. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5676.487s">Since</a> our request for simple financial information is being ignored, it's my intention to file a public records request for this information. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5684.55s">And</a> it's sad, it's absolutely sad that we have to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5688.212s">Because</a> we should have had the information by now. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5691.013s">You've</a> given them ample opportunity to provide the information and they have refused. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5698.376s">I</a> will also request a breakdown of the amount of money that the administration expended to have KP Raw represent us in land court. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5704.982s">to</a> take the position that use variances are not allowed in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5710.386s">The</a> mayor is well aware of the 2016 opinion of former city solicitor that use variances are permitted in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5720.653s">I'd</a> like to know how much the administration spent in court in its field attempt to defend a clearly baseless position. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5730.477s">By</a> using the public records law, I will either finally receive a response, or we will all receive a response to the resolutions that we have filed. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5738.103s">And</a> if not, I will seek the intervention of Secretary of State's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5742.367s">It's</a> come to that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5743.728s">We</a> have a budget coming to us, but yet we're getting absolutely no data when asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5751.274s">We</a> deserve more. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5752.075s">The</a> community deserves more. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5753.916s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5754.417s">Thank</a> you, Council Member.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_7dpVBOZN8pE/2024-11-19_7dpVBOZN8pE.html">City Council 05-25-21</a></h2>

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1773.994s">Thank</a> you, Mr. McGivern. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1775.356s">And</a> last but not least, what is the estimated completion date of this project?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=1806.648s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3202.169s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3203.029s">I</a> also want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward and thank all my council colleagues for the comments that they've made. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3208.827s">I've</a> been on that council now, this is my sixth year, and we have been talking about this project since day one. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3214.449s">And</a> the residents of Winthrop Street have had to put up with far too much with regard to this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3220.671s">This</a> is a public safety issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3224.112s">This</a> is a quality of life issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3227.913s">You're</a> in plates clanging all day as cars are going up and down Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3232.835s">The</a> dirt that Councilor Marks mentioned, this is ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3237.104s">It's</a> like, this is like the project that will never end. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3240.426s">And</a> it needs to end soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3242.407s">I</a> know at one point in time, I think it was during one of our meetings, probably about a month or two months ago, we had Eversource on the line with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3251.492s">And</a> they had mentioned that at that time, I think there was one crew working. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3256.895s">Can</a> City Engineer give us an update as to whether or not that has been increased?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3278.163s">Last</a> time we met with Eversource, I believe they mentioned that the time there was one crew working on the project or working on Winthrop Street, and it had something to do with the police detail availability. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3291.029s">Can</a> you just give us an update as to whether or not that has changed? <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3293.77s">Are</a> there more crews working on the project?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3398.203s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Giver, and I definitely, it's good news that we're having additional crews working on the project, but just going back to the original point, you know, it is a public safety issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3410.229s">It</a> is a quality of life issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3411.79s">And</a> if we're going to do it, we should be doing it right. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3414.091s">So</a> if we're going to be ripping up the road, then we should be continuing the sidewalk all the way to place that road. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3419.934s">I'm</a> definitely in support of this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3421.874s">I</a> thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3424.236s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6950.177s">Councilor</a> Mock. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6953.559s">Councilor</a> Mock's actually struck upon an important point. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6956.32s">If</a> she's not gonna be here to give us an update and no one's gonna be sent from the department to give us an update, we should get some sort of a written update as to what's going on, if there are any changes that are happening, what are the vital metrics that we should know. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6972.534s">Because</a> we're being asked all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6975.036s">And</a> we should be informed by the administration if Marianne can't come to a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6980.72s">So</a> if you could please communicate that to her and her department that if they can't send someone, at least send us some sort of a written update.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=7343.022s">the</a> main point is clarification because it seems like there are definitely some inconsistencies from what we're hearing yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=7349.205s">So</a> if we could please actually form I guess a motion amendment that we have Marion specifically state towards in writing, if there are any inconsistencies that the city is, if the city has different rules than what are being implied by the state.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=7372.806s">I</a> would like to know, I'd like to know if the city is, if the city's rules regarding COVID are different from what the state guidelines are. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=7385.415s">Are</a> the city guidelines different from the state guidelines with regard to COVID?<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_iFHofazjCG4/2024-11-19_iFHofazjCG4.html">City Council 05-18-21</a></h2>

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1288.657s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1289.398s">I</a> also want to thank Councilor Matz for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1292.082s">As</a> I was preparing for the meeting, I was reading through the resolution and it couldn't help but bring a smile to my face because I remember the theater as a kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1300.294s">I</a> remember going and I actually remember seeing Jaws at that theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1304.93s">It</a> just brought back some memories of, you know, just being a kid and walking through Method Square and doing those types of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1311.174s">And</a> I never knew that Mr. Andre owned the theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1314.176s">So</a> I just wanted to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward and echo the sentiments of my colleague, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1321.561s">The</a> Andre family has always given back generously in time and donations. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1326.924s">And</a> this is a very fitting tribute. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1329.606s">And</a> I would also second the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1331.107s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1811.455s">Perfect.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1811.996s">That's</a> fine, I'm open to the amendment, sir, thank you.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2019.676s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2020.437s">I</a> was notified by a resident last week about the condition of the curbing down at the Freedom Way and McGlynn School. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2029.626s">And</a> they sent me a number of photos, I took a drive down by myself as well just to take a look. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2034.45s">And</a> I know back a few years ago, I believe the prior administration had started a project with regard to replacing the curbing at the McGlynn School and I believe <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2044.439s">It</a> might be finished, it might be partway finished. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2046.34s">I</a> know that there is extra curbing that's on the side of the road, but there's still plenty of curbing around the school that some of it's completely obliterated. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2055.562s">It</a> looks like it's just dust on the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2057.043s">So</a> I just wanted to get some sort of an update from the administration as to when that's going to be finished or if it's going to be finished. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2063.284s">It</a> doesn't look like there's enough curbing to finish the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2066.547s">but</a> it does need to be addressed and the company needs to be replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2070.79s">If</a> someone comes from outside of the city and they see our schools like this, it's a disgrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2074.973s">It</a> doesn't say much about what we're doing about our city and how we're treating our buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2079.896s">We</a> need to make sure we're safeguarding our buildings and our school properties for the future generations of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2085.58s">And</a> this is a problem that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2087.982s">So</a> at this point, I'd just like to move approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2091.044s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5090.974s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5091.714s">I</a> also want to thank the Barry and Sutherland families for coming down today and sharing your personal stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5099.24s">I</a> had the privilege to know <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5101.858s">Miss</a> Barry was a member of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5104.94s">And</a> she was always positive, always smiling. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5108.642s">I</a> remember the smile, always smiling. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5112.024s">And</a> you mentioned she was a gift. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5113.785s">And</a> she was a gift to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5116.406s">She</a> was always there, always giving back. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5119.688s">I</a> personally did not go to the Columbus school or any of the schools that she taught at, but my nieces and nephews did. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5126.351s">And</a> I always heard great stories about Miss Barry. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5130.122s">and</a> the work she did on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5132.542s">And</a> they would talk continuously about her. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5135.443s">And</a> during school community meetings, you'd always hear Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5137.723s">Barry's</a> name come up and the great things that were happening at the Columbus School. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5142.644s">And</a> I can't thank you enough for coming down and sharing your personal stories with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5148.665s">I</a> know they mean the world to me because I knew Jean and she was fabulous. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5153.546s">And</a> like I said, I never forget the smile and the positive upbeat attitude, which this community could use now more than ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5160.748s">And</a> I just want to thank you for coming tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5162.711s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=9147.606s">Because</a> I am hurt to think of all that Gene Berry did in this school system, in Medford, and some of the rest of us.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_8uC6Vq145lQ/2024-11-19_8uC6Vq145lQ.html">City Council 05-11-21</a></h2>

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=916.664s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=917.204s">Excuse</a> me. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=918.265s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=919.586s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Marksley for bringing this forward and Vice President Knight for his comments as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=925.251s">And</a> both Councilors are right. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=927.553s">There</a> needs to be a specific long-term plan for how we're going to repave roads throughout our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=934.771s">I</a> mean, each one of us, I'm sure year after year, has received countless calls with regards to potholes, just streets being ripped up after the winter from plowing, and you can only patch so long before you need to resurface an entire street. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=951.038s">Two</a> streets a year? <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=954.11s">It's</a> completely, it's just wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=956.111s">It</a> doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=957.372s">You'll</a> never get to a point where you're going to have new streets throughout most of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=962.234s">I</a> mean, two streets a year, you're lucky to get a neighborhood done in 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=966.897s">So</a> we need to do better in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=969.098s">The</a> capital plan, <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=970.999s">Vice</a> President Knight is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=972.06s">The</a> capital plan, it does not, there's really, there's not too much to address this. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=977.404s">It</a> needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=978.585s">I</a> mean, in many ways, these are quality of life issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=981.207s">When</a> people are in their neighborhoods and they're driving and they have potholes all over the place, it's just not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=986.792s">The</a> administration needs to do a better job. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=988.553s">There</a> needs to be a long-term plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=990.755s">And</a> if I may, Councilor Marks, if you mind, if I would amend the resolution to find out exactly what streets were paved over the past two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1002.276s">And</a> if we can find out, get an itemized list of how the chapter 90 funding was spent in the past year. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1011.62s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1053.498s">Yeah,</a> correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1055.439s">President</a> Caraviello, if I may add an amendment to get an update from the DPW as to if the pilot program for resurfacing streets with recycled asphalt will be put in the budget, in the upcoming budget.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1073.728s">And</a> if I may continue on that, <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1077.033s">I</a> think it was back in February this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1080.794s">And</a> what they basically do is they take the asphalt right there, and they grind the street down, and it goes into a truck and actually put new asphalt down. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1092.498s">You</a> are correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1093.178s">It's</a> half the cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1094.659s">And</a> even if they had just a pilot program, just try a few streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1098.72s">It's</a> better than nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1099.48s">And</a> there's some streets that are in dire need of repair, and this needs to be addressed now more than ever.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1261.663s">Thank</a> you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1262.363s">Thank</a> you, President Caballero. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1264.043s">And</a> I'd like to thank Councilor Marks for bringing that forward as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1267.544s">I</a> know during this pandemic, I've been trying to do a lot of walking. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1271.112s">through</a> various neighborhoods throughout our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1273.854s">And</a> Councilor Marks is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1275.474s">If</a> you take a walk through the neighborhoods, no matter what neighborhood you go to, there are stumps everywhere and there are raised sidewalks everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1283.119s">Trip</a> hazards beyond belief. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1285.86s">And</a> they need to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1287.781s">They</a> haven't been addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1289.968s">We</a> have not been given any type of a program that's going to address these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1295.911s">The</a> residents deserve better. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1297.452s">These</a> are trip hazards literally right in front of their house. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1300.774s">Someone's</a> going to get hurt. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1301.595s">And</a> unfortunately it sounds like someone already did.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2666.295s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2667.396s">Thank</a> you very much to you and to your staff for all your hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2672.075s">With</a> regard to the 12 plus vaccine, I believe you said next Tuesday?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2693.401s">Would</a> that be in the afternoon or at night? <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2695.142s">Do</a> we have the particulars?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2727.017s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2727.557s">And</a> how are the how are the kids being notified? <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2729.838s">Is</a> there a robo call going out or verse 911?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2772.612s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2773.133s">And</a> as far as the talk about the real talk series, that's, did you say that's made 26.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2832.965s">I</a> was just gonna say, with regard to the home bond program, so you said you're almost, I believe you're almost complete with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2839.007s">And</a> what type of vaccine was given out for that? <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2841.568s">I</a> know, I believe at first you said maybe a few weeks ago, Johnson and Johnson, but that may have stopped, right?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2918.984s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2919.364s">And</a> last but not least, when we talked previously, you had mentioned the members of the community that are hesitant to the vaccine. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2927.488s">And</a> I believe the state was possibly going to come in and help out with the program where they would almost go door to door. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2932.971s">Is</a> that still happening or is that going to happen?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=3402.182s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=3403.683s">Marion,</a> I have one last question I forgot to ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=3406.877s">So</a> I know we're doing outreach to our public school families. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=3409.959s">What</a> about our Catholic school or parochial school, St. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=3412.982s">Ray's,</a> St. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=3413.482s">Joe's?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=3413.882s">Are</a> we reaching out to those parents, those populations to make sure that they know? <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=3418.126s">Absolutely.</a> 
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=3482.927s">But</a> is the outreach being done from your office to St. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=3485.828s">Ray's</a> and St. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=3486.649s">Joe's</a> to those schools?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=3506.397s">So</a> I just wanna, so as far as, so is it a robo-call to everyone in the community? <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=3510.558s">I</a> guess it is that, is someone directly calling those schools saying these shots are available? <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=3515.44s">That's</a> my question.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4161.777s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4162.917s">Councilor</a> Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4164.298s">So</a> just to try to make sure I have this right. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4167.079s">So</a> the motion is to make the diversity director of human resources part of cap 19. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4175.602s">So</a> that would be joining the two positions, if I'm correct.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4348.149s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4348.97s">I</a> want to thank my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4350.09s">We've</a> had numerous meetings, numerous Committee of the Whole meetings on this topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4354.534s">And</a> we've had a lot of valuable discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4357.036s">And</a> I still like to go back and look at the metrics. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4359.319s">We</a> have 58,000, probably close to 58,000 people in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4364.021s">Probably</a> about 4,000 students around there. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4367.722s">Hundreds</a> of employees in our school system and in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4373.524s">We</a> are one of the largest cities in the Commonwealth by population. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4378.825s">We</a> have no one specifically in the school system that is responsible for diversity and inclusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4384.756s">It's</a> a piece of someone's job, but no one is not a person that's solely responsible for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4390.819s">Diversity</a> and inclusion within our school system and within our city should be a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4396.162s">Sometimes</a> an issue comes before this council that is as much timely as it is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4403.627s">Diversity</a> is just such an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4406.768s">I</a> wanna make it abundantly clear that in my view, it is time to move the diversity issue from talk to reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4414.85s">Raising</a> the reality of inclusion and equity is not a part-time effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4419.634s">It</a> requires the attentive focus of a full-time diversity officer who has time to see the issue at every level. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4429.322s">This</a> includes hiring practices to help make sure that the faces in City Hall reflect the faces of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4437.308s">And</a> it also includes the continual analysis of our municipal contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4443.481s">Who</a> are the companies that we have, that we contract with? <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4447.524s">What</a> is the percentage of contracts that the city has with minority businesses or businesses that are owned by women? <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4454.108s">We</a> have to move from talk to action. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4457.971s">I</a> want Mr. Osborne to know that my objection to the mayor's request is not a reflection on his abilities or his professionalism. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4466.066s">It</a> is about what the city needs, and it is time that we meet the need of diversity and inclusion head on. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4473.227s">And</a> the mayor's request does not do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4475.928s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_FOGKQdOAGpI/2024-11-19_FOGKQdOAGpI.html">City Council 05-04-21</a></h2>

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1847.864s">Okay,</a> thank you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1852.196s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1853.797s">If</a> you could, and I apologize, before I couldn't get a good view, but could you just show me what the flow would be like going into the driveway for someone that wants to get gas? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1863.161s">Yes,</a> sir, of course.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1886.696s">You</a> don't have any concerns with queuing that way? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1889.917s">I</a> mean, to me, it seems like you could kind of get into a bit of a log jam once you take that right to get in if you have multiple cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1896.078s">I'm</a> not questioning, but just so I'm clear, when you say that way, you're referring to the entrance? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1899.419s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1899.759s">So</a> when you go into the area where you're going to get gas, so you come into the driveway, you take that right. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1906.98s">I</a> mean, there are a lot of pumps, which is great, but if you have, I mean, sometimes <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1911.55s">get</a> a lot of customers, which I guess would be a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1914.151s">I</a> mean, I would imagine you'd get pretty jammed in there, no? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1917.111s">No,</a> no, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1917.671s">I</a> mean, it's a great question.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1990.93s">Do</a> you have that same kind of set up at your other locations? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=1993.051s">Yes,</a> sir.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2003.335s">If</a> I may, Mr. President, do we have anyone on the line from the administration that's answering questions?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2028.493s">Alicia,</a> my question will be, you know, when you take a look at the gas tanks that have, you know, proposed for BJs, how do they compare to the gas tanks across the street? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2042.481s">Are</a> they same size, same number of tanks? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2045.042s">I'm</a> just kind of curious.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2058.313s">Do</a> we have anything on file that we can look at?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2066.599s">To</a> me, I'm curious about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2070.443s">That's</a> just, you know, I mean, to me, there's a lot of <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2075.393s">I'm</a> not a gasoline expert. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2077.694s">I</a> mean, but I know there's a lot of gas in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2080.335s">I</a> mean, you're talking, what, I think between the three tanks, there are like 60,000 gallons worth of gas?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2089.86s">And</a> then I would imagine, if I'm correct, the gas station across the street is pretty sizable as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2095.677s">I</a> don't know what they have, but I would imagine it might be something similar. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2098.739s">So</a> I'm just curious as to what, you know, that gas station has across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2104.104s">And</a> I don't know, but I mean, I'm not sure what are the gas stations in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2107.566s">I'm</a> not sure how they set up, but I mean, that's, to me, that's just kind of curious about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2114.732s">With</a> regard to gasoline, so I have questions regarding gasoline delivery. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2120.236s">How</a> often will this be, will you be getting gas deliveries? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2123.619s">Is</a> that something that you would be able to answer?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2133.805s">One</a> time per day to fill up? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2134.986s">Approximately,</a> yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2136.227s">And</a> is that coming at a certain time?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2160.225s">And</a> if it's not at a certain time, is it going to be between certain hours? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2164.267s">Will</a> it be coming late at night or early in the morning?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2180.592s">So</a> is there, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2182.338s">So</a> one of my concerns would be, and we haven't heard from the neighbors yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2185.901s">I</a> mean, could there be a gas delivery at five in the morning? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2188.443s">Is</a> that something that could happen?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2214.422s">Are</a> these large tanker trucks that are delivering the fuel?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2228.272s">And</a> I'm just thinking with regard to the neighbors, you know, especially if you're going late at night, early in the morning, do these have diesel engines, these trucks? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2238.139s">You</a> know, diesel engines are usually louder, so.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2255.496s">Does</a> that make sense? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2257.216s">That</a> makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2260.937s">I'm</a> just trying to think of the impact it's going to have on the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2264.679s">And</a> I know, for me, if I lived in the neighborhood, I would have questions like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2269.721s">how</a> is it going to impact the residents? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2271.282s">That's</a> so, you know, quality of life issue, noise, traffic, you know, these are all things that, you know, I have questions about. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2280.408s">When</a> I look at a project like that, that's why I ask these types of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2283.751s">It</a> does have an impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2285.332s">As</a> minimal as you may think it seems, I'm not saying that you think it's minimal. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2291.216s">Some</a> people might think it's minimal, but if you live in the neighborhood, it's a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2296.339s">So</a> that's why I'm asking these questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2299.778s">Is</a> there a, so as far as the safety devices that are set up, I mean, I would imagine there's all kinds of safety devices within the pumps and whatnot.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2328.59s">We</a> buy the best that money can buy. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2333.994s">With</a> regard to the parking lot and the new plantings, which I think that's the vast improvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2341.218s">One</a> of the complaints I received is that at times the lot can be dirty, trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2349.124s">So</a> is there a maintenance plan for that parking lot? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2353.526s">Put</a> it this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2356.408s">You're</a> just saying that I think the plant things on Woodruff and the Woodruff side, they were in tough shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2362.713s">So</a> to me, when I hear that, that means that maybe they haven't been maintained. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2366.816s">They</a> have, you know, so therefore, you know, BJ's maybe hasn't been on the ball with regards to the maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2372.04s">I</a> mean, is there a maintenance plan in place where this is going to be, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2376.755s">maintained</a> on a regular basis, cleaned on a regular basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2380.518s">You</a> know, if you're putting down mulch yearly, can you talk a little bit about that?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2614.081s">So</a> do you have a maintenance plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2617.124s">Is</a> there something in writing a maintenance plan that BJ's has for this parking lot?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2622.309s">We</a> have an internal document. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2623.81s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2624.27s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2624.571s">Is</a> that something you can send to us? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2625.912s">It'd</a> be nice to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2628.173s">I</a> mean, like I said before, that's one of the complaints I get. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2631.116s">I</a> know when I'm walking through there, sometimes, you know, it looks like, you know, I'm not sure how often you have a street sweeper come through. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2640.003s">But</a> you mentioned, this is, I mean, for some people, this is their front yard. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2644.166s">And</a> they're literally looking at this all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2647.368s">So</a> therefore, you know what, it should be clean all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=2650.151s">That's</a> the way I look
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=5119.042s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=5120.102s">And</a> I also want to thank you for your presentation tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=5122.023s">I</a> appreciate you answering all our questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=5123.624s">You</a> were just talking about the fence. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=5126.545s">Has</a> anyone reached out to the neighbors to see what the neighbors would like for a fence? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=5130.627s">Because</a> I think they're the ones who are going to have to see it every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=5132.728s">Has</a> there been any discussion there with regards to what type of fence they would like to see?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=5205.354s">I</a> would think that, you know, as far as the fence goes, I would think that the neighbors should have, they should weigh heavily in the decision as to what type of fence should go there, because they're going to have to see it every single day. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=5220.901s">So</a> the way I look at it is they should have a, you know, a major, you know, role in that decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=5229.744s">As</a> far as having an opening, I would say that's a discussion with the neighbors as well, because that is going to create foot traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=5236.605s">I'm</a> not sure if that's what they want or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=5238.846s">And</a> I definitely want to hear from the neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=5240.486s">I</a> know that there's probably, I would imagine, some that want to speak on this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=5246.007s">But</a> I would think they should definitely have a role with regard to what type of fence is selected. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=5251.828s">The</a> other question I had was for the traffic engineer, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=5254.893s">And</a> I apologize if I missed this, because I was trying to take some notes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=5258.355s">When</a> was it, did you say you put traffic counters on the street? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=5261.056s">When</a> was that done?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=5291.945s">That</a> was my question. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=5292.945s">I</a> just wanted to make sure there were pre-COVID pandemic numbers.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=5297.948s">Okay,</a> thank you very much.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=5451.383s">Mr.</a> President, if I may ask one quick question, how big is the propane tank in the back of the lawn?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=5472.421s">No,</a> I appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=5473.461s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=5473.981s">I</a> mean, I'd rather you answer that.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=6123.135s">Mr.</a> President, can you put his microphone on? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=6125.195s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=6127.336s">Pat,</a> can you put his microphone on?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=7217.381s">Councilor</a> Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=7218.941s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=7220.922s">Thank</a> you very much for showing us the detailed drawings. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=7227.723s">Just</a> a couple of quick questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=7228.783s">So</a> do we know when the work will be performed with regard to the rest of the installation?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=7279.976s">And</a> in that trip, maybe Tim McGivin can answer this if he's on the call, but why one crew?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=7318.361s">Do</a> you know when that reevaluation will take place?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=7333.433s">As</a> far as do we know, so do we know why is this going to take place? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=7340.178s">Do</a> we know how long it's going to take place? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=7342.179s">I</a> mean, I would imagine it sounds like it's all over the map if we're not sure how many crews that are going to be doing the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=7349.565s">If</a> it's one crew, I'm hoping that the one crew is just short term.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=7363.036s">And</a> is it basically the number of people that can do details or is it actually a budget issue?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=7375.738s">So</a> it is truly a number of people that can never, officers available for details. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=7384.74s">Are</a> the residents being notified when the work's going to be taking place?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=7399.932s">And</a> will the work be taking place between certain hours?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=7423.133s">Okay,</a> so do you have any type of goal as to when this is going to be finally completed? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=7431.975s">I</a> know we've been talking about this project, I think for, it's quite a few years now.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=7511.479s">Okay,</a> and so, okay, so it sounds like it's one crew for the time being until we can free up more details to increase the number of crews.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=7528.977s">Please.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=7529.929s">By</a> all means, yeah.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=7583.021s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=7584.102s">No</a> further questions at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=7585.423s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=7586.024s">Councilor</a> Biz.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8115.491s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8118.434s">Councilor</a> Berco. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8119.715s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8120.456s">To</a> Councilor Morell's point, if I may, you said it's broom swept, is that what you mentioned?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8144.767s">At</a> any point in time, is there a source ever sent through a street sweeping crew?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8167.204s">Maybe</a> it's time to get the street sweeper out there on a more regular basis, especially people are gonna be biking and walking more often. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8174.906s">It</a> might be, I mean, I would think in the interest of public safety, it'd be best to have that go through on a regular basis, at least once a week, I would think, just to keep it clean and safe for everyone involved.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8195.047s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8196.187s">If</a> I may, I have to go back to the number of crews. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8199.889s">So</a> you were saying, I think, back last summer, at one point in time, you had three crews during the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8205.371s">Is</a> that correct?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8208.812s">Would</a> I be correct in saying that if you wanted this job that's starting again, or project, I should say, on April 20th, ideally, would you want to have three crews again? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8219.676s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8223.214s">So</a> I know occasionally when we have a lot of road work going on and construction work, sometimes there are details that if we don't have enough people to cover, we go outside and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8235.88s">Has</a> that been entertained as an option?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8243.463s">So</a> sometimes when we have major construction projects going on or various construction projects, we might not have enough people to cover the detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8252.088s">I</a> believe the city goes outside occasionally to have people cover those details. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8256.81s">Has</a> that been an option that the administration has looked at?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8292.688s">So</a> has that been done when you had your most recent meeting and decided to start the work on April 20th? <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8299.073s">Was</a> there any discussion to go outside for those details?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8332.998s">I</a> know this is not right, but I feel like the police chief's running the project now. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8338.851s">You</a> know, and I don't mean to say that, I'm not trying to be, I just, to me it seems like we should, this project has been going on for, I think, I've been on the council for, I'm in my sixth year. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8351.558s">I</a> think this project has been going on for at least four of those six years. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8357.1s">And</a> it just seems like the work needs to get done sooner than later. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8363.084s">I</a> feel like having one crew start on April 20th <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8367.29s">is</a> completely disingenuous to the people that live on that roadway. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8370.451s">I</a> mean, they have been putting up with construction on a regular basis for a long time now. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8377.713s">And</a> I would think it should be a major priority for this administration to really get this done. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8384.255s">And</a> what I feel like when we're starting off with one crew, I feel like the priority is not there. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8390.196s">And</a> I'm not sure if Tim, you can address this or Rob, if you can address this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8393.597s">I</a> mean, it just seems like there should be more <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8397.201s">There</a> should be more crews to really get this done.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8545.318s">If</a> I may, Tim, does the Mayor sit in on those meetings as well?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8560.16s">And</a> he's fine with the one crew working on this project?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8567.484s">And</a> he's fine with the one crew working on this project?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=8586.663s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12555.924s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12556.905s">I</a> also wanted to send my condolences to the Bruno family. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12560.948s">Mr.</a> Bruno is a great person. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12563.19s">I'll</a> never forget the day when I first won elections to the city council, my first time running. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12569.936s">It</a> was the first phone call I got the next morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12572.598s">He</a> called me, he congratulated me, he wished me well. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12575.629s">and</a> very, very supportive and love to talk about Matthew, love to talk about the issues, but he was just a really, really special person. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12588.98s">Someone</a> that is, you just can't replace. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12592.003s">I</a> mean, he's just a really special part of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12596.106s">You</a> always saw him with his grandkids and he was always having fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12599.809s">He</a> was always smiling, easy to talk to, and he will be missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12605.317s">tremendously</a> in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12606.718s">My</a> thoughts and prayers go out to his family. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12610.422s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6Dwt4KXgHTk&t=12610.802s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_0CWldZ_RYd4/2024-11-19_0CWldZ_RYd4.html">City Council 04-06-21</a></h2>
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=1261.104s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=1261.885s">And</a> thank you, Chief, for being with us here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=1264.646s">And</a> I apologize that it's a little bit late. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=1267.868s">And</a> I have a couple of quick questions, three questions that actually, I think you touched upon some of it when Councilor Scott probably was asking me questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=1276.214s">So</a> I apologize if it's a little repetitive. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=1279.096s">It's</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=1280.037s">How</a> many firefighters do we currently have? <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=1282.098s">How</a> many are retiring? <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=1283.159s">And</a> how many should we have?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=1324.609s">And</a> is the 124 is how many we should have?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=1344.678s">Hopefully.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=1347.759s">Without</a> getting too detailed because they know it's not a budget meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=1351.701s">How</a> many do you feel we should have?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=1399.03s">Chief,</a> thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=1400.03s">And</a> thank you to the men and women of the fire department.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2181.574s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2183.035s">And</a> I thank you for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2184.276s">I</a> was actually out on a walk this weekend and I did notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2187.813s">that</a> it looks like actually it's already pre-cut and it looks kind of almost like an S going all the way down Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2193.517s">So</a> the question I had and actually Councilor Scott, probably you just hit it in the last part of your comments was basically let's find out what's going on, but let's get the timetable. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2203.705s">Let's</a> make sure that we have a timetable that the residents have a timetable as to when the work is going to happen, how long it's going to take and when this job is finally going to be done.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2213.892s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2635.86s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5122.432s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5123.213s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Marks for bringing this forward tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5127.736s">And</a> I know Councilor Marks, you brought a number of resolutions regarding 5G before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5133.801s">And</a> I want to thank you both for all your time, effort, and energy that you put into this, because I know you put in a large amount of time and effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5141.828s">I</a> think the last resolution you put forward, there were at least nine amendments, which, you know, it was very detailed. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5149.874s">And</a> I thank you for your time advocating <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5153.068s">for</a> the residents and thank the residents for coming down as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5156.851s">You</a> know, technology is great, but if there are adverse health effects, you know, those need to be looked at and they need to be researched and there shouldn't be a rush to judgment. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5166.597s">I</a> myself have someone that I actually have a telephone pole right in front of my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5171.88s">It's</a> probably about 15, 20 feet from the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5174.181s">And</a> I know I wouldn't want it in front of my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5177.515s">You</a> know, I mean, from everything I read, it's questionable. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5181.296s">We</a> don't have the answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5182.916s">And</a> to vote on this, I mean, I don't feel comfortable on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5187.117s">I</a> mean, I know I wouldn't want to put it in front of my house if I didn't have those answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5192.679s">And</a> I feel like it's very unclear. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5194.179s">The</a> research is unclear. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5196.06s">And</a> it needs to be researched more. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5198.9s">And</a> like I said, if there's any type of health effects, negative health effects, they need to be researched. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5207.403s">You</a> know, I thank you for, you know, standing up and then fighting and I'm here with you and I support your motion, your amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5215.589s">So</a> I thank you for continuing this and bringing it forward and I'm with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=5220.712s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=7913.147s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=7914.287s">As</a> our budget season is quickly approaching, it is time to look at all of our various accounts to see where money is and how it's being spent and to make sure that we finish the year in good shape and start off the next fiscal year in good shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=7932.802s">Back</a> in 2010, then Mayor McGlynn signed a billboard agreement with Clair Channel. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=7937.834s">And</a> the agreement stated that Clear Channel would make a lump payment, an impact fee payment to the city in the year, in the 11th year of the agreement, which would be fiscal year 2021 of $250,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=7952.982s">And</a> I came across this through some research, basically after the budget was passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=7960.947s">And</a> when I asked the administration, I was told that this was not factored into the budget, <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=7967.176s">And</a> that came from the CFO. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=7969.698s">And</a> then I was forwarded on to the chief of staff, Dave Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=7973.54s">Dave</a> did tell me that they learned of the payment after the budget was prepared and therefore was not part of the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=7982.205s">And</a> at that point in time, I asked, well, how's the money being spent? <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=7986.368s">And</a> the explanation I received was that the city's current plan is to use it for one time unanticipated costs <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=7993.544s">and</a> emergency health safety costs that cannot be covered by the CARES or FEMA. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=7998.886s">For</a> example, let's see, there's an engineer that contacted the mayor's office in a panic that the road work at the bottom of Bedford High School is scheduled to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8008.37s">This</a> is back in August, that they didn't have enough, let's see, that the, was gonna be canceled due to not having necessary funds available. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8016.833s">And</a> the mayor was able to okay this by using these funds from, that they had from the, <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8024.258s">from</a> the impact fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8026.239s">The</a> section of Harris Park did not have fence, which the city staff were concerned about from a safety perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8033.503s">And</a> they were able to repair this using these funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8037.765s">They</a> used these funds for roading control in response to complaints received throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8042.927s">And</a> they also used it for road and safety, pedestrian improvements around the city, particularly around the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8052.796s">So</a> that was a plan for the funds, but as we approach the budget season, I'd like to get a full detailed listing of exactly how these funds were spent and how much was spent on each of these projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8067.268s">So</a> if we could get, so basically if I could get a detailed itemized listing of how the $250,000 was spent from the billboard agreements, and if we could send that to the CFO and to the chief of staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8082.432s">I</a> greatly appreciate and I move approval.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8143.525s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8144.705s">It</a> sounds like someone's been reading the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8147.246s">I</a> went by yesterday and the speed trailer is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8149.647s">It</a> is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8150.647s">So</a> that has been put in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8153.088s">Hopefully</a> it's effective and hopefully it's going to slow down traffic in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8158.13s">As</a> we know, traffic has been a major concern <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8161.311s">in</a> that Fells Ave neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8162.812s">And</a> we had a Committee of the Whole meeting there back, I think it was in November of last year that was well attended. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8170.697s">And</a> at the conclusion of that meeting, there was going to be a follow-up Committee of the Whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8175.16s">And</a> I would ask if you could please, if I could amend the resolution to request that we have a follow-up Committee of the Whole meeting with regard to all of the safety improvements that have been made <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8190.788s">potential</a> of additional improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8192.369s">I</a> know Councilor Mark said we've had some amendments in a previous resolution with regard to, I think it was, no through traffic, I think that's on particular streets, if I remember correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8205.456s">So</a> if we could have a committee of the whole to revisit this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8210.942s">I</a> greatly appreciate it.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8261.779s">KP</a> Law has been a point of conversation, I think, since they started doing business with the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8266.961s">And</a> I know that there is a, I believe it's a $5,000 a month retainer <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8271.474s">And</a> it's basically 60,000 for the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8274.715s">But</a> there's work that they do outside of their general month to month work. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8278.595s">We've</a> asked many questions about the 40B projects that they're working on. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8283.236s">We</a> don't tend to get too much information, but I know that they've been working on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8289.037s">Basically,</a> I think all of the 40B projects that have come about. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8293.598s">And</a> when I go through the detailed bills that we get from the CFO, I have not found any, <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8300.529s">KP</a> law invoices that have come through outside of the budget of $5,000 per month. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8309.702s">So</a> I've gone through, I can't find anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8312.104s">And</a> I know that various consulates have had many questions about KP Law since their inception into working with the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8320.529s">So</a> what I'd like to do is just ask that the administration give us basically breakdown of all the invoices outside of the monthly retainer, a breakdown of all of the invoices that have been paid <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8338.294s">And</a> basically what's outstanding, it seems like, from what I can tell, they've been doing work with us for over a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8345.277s">And</a> it seems like there are no invoices. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8348.098s">It</a> seems like the administration hasn't received any invoices to pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8351.739s">To</a> me, that's just, it's ludicrous. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8355.64s">I</a> mean, what company does work, it doesn't build a client. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8361.463s">I</a> mean, there should have been some sort of invoices that have come in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8365.928s">I</a> mean, I also like to add to further to find out where, where is that cost spend budgeted in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8372.689s">So</a> it just seems like KPI just seems like there's a really, it's a lot of, it's a big gray area. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8379.33s">When</a> you look at the budget, it doesn't look like it's budgeted for and from what I can tell, you know, it doesn't look like there are any invoices coming in outside of the $5,000 per month appropriation that has been made.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8426.826s">This</a> is vital. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8427.506s">We</a> need to know this. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8428.346s">We</a> need to know how much we're paying them. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8431.587s">You</a> know, what's outstanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8432.787s">I</a> still don't, I don't understand how a law firm does work. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8436.848s">It</a> doesn't build a client. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8437.708s">It</a> doesn't make any sense.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8528.591s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=9624.598s">You</a> just went through a 5G conversation, very nicely and tastefully said and done, and respectfully done.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=9725.432s">And</a> move an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=9726.572s">I</a> didn't mention his name.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=11505.781s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=11506.661s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Knight and Councilor Scarpelli for the awards. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=11512.926s">I</a> first met Al when I was a sophomore in high school, 1985. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=11515.648s">I</a> was on that team that won the GBL championship. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=11519.83s">And</a> I remember when I first met Al, it was a pretty intimidating situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=11524.614s">He</a> was a captain, but he was a leader. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=11527.836s">And</a> he could lead both on and off the field. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=11530.778s">Really</a> nice guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=11533.629s">When</a> you're on the team, you treat it like family. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=11537.712s">And</a> he was a great guy, a fierce competitor, great football player, offense, defense, he could do it all. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=11546.54s">He</a> kicked too. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=11547.701s">He</a> was a kicker at one point. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=11549.342s">And</a> he was just a great competitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=11553.165s">And,</a> you know, like Councilor Scarpelli said, I remember those days, Coach Bud Kelly, another great person. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=11562.648s">He</a> would always talk repeatedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=11564.409s">He</a> got blue and white running through the veins, and no one had more blue and white running through their veins than Al McDougal. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=11570.713s">You</a> know, he was just a great person and he won't be missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=11575.415s">So,</a> Captain Al, my thoughts and prayers are with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=11580.498s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Palacio. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=11581.438s">Councilor</a> Marks.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_ilBXW43EmQ8/2024-11-19_ilBXW43EmQ8.html">City Council 03-30-21</a></h2>

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2497.626s">Thank</a> you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2498.986s">And</a> if I may add as well, as someone who lives up in Fulton Heights, this is really the only bus route that is really easily accessible to all residents in Fulton Heights. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2512.585s">When</a> you look at that bus at 710, it cuts right up, right through the middle of the heights. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2518.334s">Easily</a> accessible, seniors want to take it, they can walk to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2522.781s">If</a> they need to walk to the 100, that's a long way to walk down to 710. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2527.912s">you</a> know, the Fellsway or up to Highland Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2530.553s">So</a> this is a route that I feel is a necessity, the 710. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2536.135s">You</a> know, this wasn't even a service reduction, it was a service elimination, which is the worst. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2542.498s">You</a> know, I know with COVID, you know, people probably aren't commuting as much, but there still needs to be options. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2549.26s">And</a> I feel that pulling away the 710 or pulling it out of the neighborhood, it just really does a disservice to anyone that lives in that neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2557.348s">I</a> believe the MBTA is getting, I think about, I thought I heard about a billion dollars in pandemic relief. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2564.076s">That's</a> a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2565.337s">And</a> I know that there's plenty of routes that have been eliminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2568.04s">I</a> mean, I know 325 and 326 here in Medford have been eliminated, but <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2575.1s">From</a> what I hear, from what I've seen in the past, anytime a route is eliminated, it's really hard to bring it back. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2581.524s">And</a> I feel that the 710 needs to be brought back, and it needs to be brought back sooner than later. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2587.128s">You</a> talk about the MBTA assessments, and we've talked about that numerous times. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2591.831s">This</a> city is assessed millions of dollars on a yearly basis by the MBTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2597.557s">and</a> we need to get millions and millions of dollars year after year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2602.562s">It's</a> a service reduction in my eyes, it's absolutely unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2607.947s">The</a> MBTA needs to bring this line back into service. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2612.892s">Like</a> you said before, it really covers, there's necessities that a lot of seniors need. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2617.776s">I</a> mean, it takes you to stop and chop, it takes you to Wegmans, Lawrence Memorial Hospital, Wellington Station. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2623.436s">I</a> mean, these are places where people need to go and now more than ever, this bus needs to be in service and ready for people to take so I just wanted to, at this point I guess move approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2636.326s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2637.187s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_YjIKMi7y7_Q/2024-11-19_YjIKMi7y7_Q.html">City Council 03-23-21</a></h2>

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=780.913s">Yeah,</a> absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=781.773s">And</a> as far as the two in a nutshell, who's responsible for like coordinating this and putting it together? <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=789.516s">Would</a> this be you?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=824.767s">No,</a> no, that makes sense it as far as the last questioning it. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=828.09s">You</a> mentioned I think, you know, working to, I think, trying to <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=835.768s">just</a> looking at my scribble notes here. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=837.67s">As</a> far as I believe you said we need to do more work with reaching out to some of our more diverse community. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=844.095s">Did</a> you say you're going that we're beginning to do some outreach or comment more on that.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=892.704s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=893.485s">And</a> one last final question. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=894.705s">I</a> just thought of this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=896.426s">Right</a> now is City Hall open? <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=898.446s">Is</a> it? <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=899.427s">I</a> know City Hall is open. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=900.287s">But</a> as far as the number of employees, is it restricted to 50% or something like that?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=908.194s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=908.574s">Is</a> that going to be changing anytime soon? <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=910.496s">Or</a> is that if you could just have any on that?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=920.382s">Okay,</a> no problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=921.423s">Thank</a> you so much for your help. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=922.464s">And</a> now they can be a hard work to both you and to your department. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=924.906s">Appreciate</a> it.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2555.853s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2556.913s">And</a> I'd like to thank my colleagues for asking some great questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2562.208s">I</a> thank Chief Buckley for his leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2565.009s">And</a> also thank the woman and men of the Medford Police Department for all the hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2571.131s">I</a> think especially over the past year with COVID, it's amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2576.994s">And</a> I know the number of calls that I'm looking through this report, it's really amazing to look at the data, look at the increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2584.637s">I</a> know there's a slight dip this past year, but I think probably a lot of the calls were a lot more challenging as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2591.461s">with</a> COVID and it's, you know, it's amazing how, you know, you put your own safety and well-being on the line every day, you know, in a normal day, and then you put COVID into it as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2602.949s">I</a> know it's been a very challenging year, but I want to thank you for your leadership and all your hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2608.613s">And</a> thank you for this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2610.594s">This</a> is really, I mean, I love to see data and this is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2614.176s">You</a> can look at this over the past three, four years, and you can really see <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2618.798s">the</a> uptick in the number of calls and it's, you know, I haven't had a chance to really read it yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2625.021s">I</a> may have just received it when I came to the meeting, but I know I'll be reading it over and I'll definitely be giving you a call probably with more in-depth questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2633.965s">I</a> also wanted to thank Detective Stanton, especially this domestic violence piece in the back of the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2641.468s">It's</a> really good to take a look at this documentation to see what we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2647.005s">And,</a> you know, it helps answer a lot of questions that sometimes people might have. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2651.528s">And,</a> but Chief Buckley, if I may, really quick, and I know this is just because, like I said, I haven't had a chance to really digest this report yet, but when you look at this report, do you see, is there like a number one issue or number one concern or top one, two, three list of things that you would be concerned about or think need to be addressed?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2943.638s">Chief,</a> that was very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2944.658s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2945.258s">I</a> appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2946.239s">And</a> thank you to Rob for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2949.24s">I</a> deal with a lot of this type of work where I work during the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2955.202s">And</a> a lot of time, effort, and energy goes into stuff like this here. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2959.844s">And</a> you can tell. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2960.824s">And</a> the report, just by going through it, <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2965.073s">I</a> mean, it tells a story and, you know, about the hard work that you in the department go through on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2970.577s">So</a> I just want to thank you for your leadership and your hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2974.901s">And</a> like I said, I'm going to go through this more thoroughly and I'll be calling you with some additional questions, but thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=2982.066s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4580.324s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4581.545s">And</a> I missed what you said before. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4582.706s">Did</a> you say how many police vehicles?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4610.552s">No</a> problem, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4611.492s">And</a> when did you start, when did the DPW start maintaining the police car, police fleet?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4649.617s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4650.238s">And</a> last but not least, do you have any major concerns? <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4654.081s">What</a> would be a major concern regarding the DPW that you think might be in the horizon or might need to be addressed?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4706.025s">Very</a> good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4707.386s">Good</a> luck with your shot tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4708.946s">And</a> once again, thank you to you and your department for all your hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4712.708s">Appreciate</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4713.289s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=4713.609s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1907.147s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1908.068s">Through</a> you to the chief of staff, I think, so we're gonna have pre-budget meetings as well or no?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=1939.931s">So</a> if I may, to the chief of staff, so is it just a matter of finding the time?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2065.848s">If</a> I may really quick, I think that's true. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2068.049s">I</a> think I know from, I think I know kind of what a council appears is trying to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2073.252s">And</a> I think that's kind of like when we had the Lawrence Memorial update meetings, we passed the original resolution, but that same resolution would come up every time that they were going to be on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2084.657s">So</a> I'm thinking that <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2085.919s">You</a> know, I mean.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2100.966s">But</a> I guess through what Councilor Bears is saying is how would the general public know that they're going to be here?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2114.123s">I</a> understand that, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2115.244s">But</a> when they get this agenda on Friday, they get everything that's going to be on this current week. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2121.067s">If</a> that information is not on this agenda, no one would know that they were ever going to be here to present. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2125.589s">That's</a> all I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2126.25s">I</a> mean, I agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2127.11s">I</a> want them here, believe me, and I want them to present. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2129.852s">But</a> the general public wouldn't know they're going to be here if it's not on here again. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2133.274s">That's</a> all I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2135.975s">I</a> think we're all in agreement.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2141.889s">Exactly.</a> 
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2455.26s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=4991.192s">Right,</a> I don't think so either.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=5206.736s">Mr.</a> President, I reviewed the records. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=5208.577s">They</a> appear to be in order and I move approval.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_8GLOO-_Tbro/2024-11-19_8GLOO-_Tbro.html">City Council 03-09-21</a></h2>

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5660.765s">Yes,</a> member Uso. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5662.587s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5663.708s">Could</a> you just ask that whoever is taking minutes to note that our student representative, Colin Bailey is actually in the meeting.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=5951.066s">Motion</a> to approve.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=11530.545s">So</a> I don't expect that many of these questions have answers yet, but two questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=11538.046s">One,</a> Somerville is finally bringing their students back and they are mandating if you wanna come back, you will be getting COVID tests. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=11547.608s">And</a> their attorneys have said that that is legal. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=11551.249s">And</a> as we approach the scenario where <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=11554.518s">One,</a> most of our students are not getting COVID tests, and we may have got quite as many students packed in or more into the same spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=11565.284s">Have</a> we contemplated mandating tests if you want to remain in any kind of in-person instruction?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=11645.628s">I</a> just want to sort of play that out a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=11649.511s">I</a> know families, and they've reached out to me and probably many members, that they selected hybrid after much deliberation around the risks that they're willing to accept and the benefit that they get by sending their kid in. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=11665.959s">That</a> is a completely unrelated to many families, a completely unrelated deliberation to going full-time with all the kids in the classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=11678.544s">So</a> I would just say that while I understand the need to solve the cohorting problem as described around attendance, and of course that makes sense to me, frankly, you know, the challenges around attendance we've been talking about since before even school started and the fact <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=11694.878s">the</a> systems couldn't handle a lot of the coding that we needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=11698.079s">But</a> I will say that there are going to be families who will confirm hybrid. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=11705.323s">And</a> then the day we are told that they have to be full time, you can fully expect they will be in Court D or they will be waiting for the police to show up to take their kid to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=11715.467s">And</a> I literally saw that and heard that exact sentiment on Facebook. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=11720.558s">You</a> know, families that were willing to deal with the risk of being in a class with two or three other kids, because some of those classes at the high school, you know, you've all looked around, sometimes it looks like there's nobody in there at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=11735.646s">It's</a> not the same as being in a classroom with twice or more kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=11740.549s">And</a> I just, I think we need to be prepared that we're going to be looking at a huge bump in cohort D. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=11749.91s">Yes,</a> a huge bump in cohort D and be prepared for that because I think as certainly as a member, I will support families in their desire to do that because the decision to be hybrid is unrelated to the decision to be full-time in-person with all the classes.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=11959.205s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=11959.625s">And</a> my second question, whatever it was, was a super easy one, I hope. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=11964.468s">And</a> as we <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=11967.785s">anticipate</a> having to send more kids in. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=11971.266s">I</a> heard today from two different parents who send their kids into the high school with their own personal hotspots because the internet is just not capable. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=11979.51s">So</a> whether it's one and a half or two and a half times as many students that are all gonna be on the internet at the same time, I hope we are already freaking out frankly to figure out how we can have sufficient internet for
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12150.144s">Are</a> we saying that, you know, over the summer as the entire planet tried to buy Chromebooks and other devices, and those of us that had the resources went out and spent $1,000 on a MacBook Air for our kids, so that there were in fact enough devices available for everybody else, that $1,000 investment, if I send my kids a Chromebook to dad, here's a $300 Chromebook instead? <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12176.217s">I</a> mean, that's really, <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12177.557s">can't</a> be the message, because I'll be angry as a parent.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=12187.686s">Is</a> my audio really audible?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13301.328s">I'm</a> understanding this to be the you know the <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13304.773s">what</a> we did in person, the pieces of paper, where you would write the motion and say who voted for what.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13336.663s">Oh,</a> sorry, a quick, sorry, more quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13340.084s">I</a> just want to make sure we, are we keeping a separate sheet for executive session votes so that we don't accidentally post that to the public?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13568.496s">I</a> believe that it's really appropriate to read all of the text. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=13571.637s">I'm</a> concerned that the summarization.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15103.331s">Thank</a> you, ma'am. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15104.412s">I</a> just wanted to, I sent this out to the committee a week ago, which is not the normal procedure, but I wanted everybody to have a chance to actually look it over. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15112.697s">I</a> also did wanna say that this resolution that I wrote was an attempt to give us something to work from or to react to, rather than getting us together with a blank piece of paper and trying to draft a frankly technical document <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15128.839s">from</a> thin air. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15130.92s">Many</a> of the elements of this are not things that I feel strongly about and are in fact meant to get us to deliberate and to get to a place where we're comfortable with a final product. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15142.683s">So</a> I appreciate Member van der Kloet's alternate version, which takes a different approach to many of the elements. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15149.165s">And</a> I look forward to the conversations around how to bring them together. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15152.506s">I</a> guess this is what conference committees are like between the Senate and the House. <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15156.988s">We</a> have to
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ta9ruAXAWFc&t=15160.876s">And</a> obviously all the members will have all the opportunity to tear them both apart or whatever, so we can get to something we like.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=493.444s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=494.165s">And</a> I want to thank Councilor Knight for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=496.186s">It's</a> a resolution that I definitely support. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=501.529s">And</a> I think, you know, it's not too early to think about budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=503.931s">We</a> need to be talking about budget and the sooner the better. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=508.013s">You</a> know, we received our Q2 budget update, let's see, a few weeks ago and Councilor Knight's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=514.457s">The</a> basically a forecasting, I think a five to $8 million structural deficit. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=519.34s">Now</a> more than ever, we need to be working with the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=522.662s">The</a> administration should be working with us to let us know where the city stands with regard to the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=530.687s">The</a> quarterly updates are good. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=532.689s">I</a> mean, we get to take a look at the data or some of the data and we get to know kind of where we're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=537.612s">It's</a> a little bit of a roadmap. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=539.494s">but</a> we really need transparency from the administration now with regard to the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=545.744s">And</a> we need to have up-to-date information as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=551.9s">No,</a> the budget is not only a fiduciary responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=557.142s">It's</a> good government. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=557.962s">We</a> need to make sure that we're on top of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=560.583s">We're</a> coming into a really, really tough budget year. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=563.084s">We</a> all know it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=564.405s">And</a> we need to have pre-budget meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=567.266s">It's</a> something that everyone on this council supports. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=570.747s">The</a> administration was going to work with us last year on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=573.988s">We</a> need to make sure we're working on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=575.669s">I</a> know COVID happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=576.99s">We</a> need to make sure we're working on this now. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=579.531s">If</a> you take a look, <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=581.378s">And</a> I believe the request was, let's just meet with the major departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=586.76s">Let's</a> meet with the DPW, the police department, the fire department, just to see what is the budget going to look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=593.723s">If</a> you take a look at last year's budget, which I believe was about $185 million, 36 million was a DPW, 14 million, the police department, 14 million, the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=604.928s">That</a> takes you to about $64 million, I believe about 35% of the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=610.383s">We're</a> only asking to meet with four departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=613.525s">I</a> don't think that's too much to ask for. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=615.726s">And</a> if you throw in the school department, which I think is really important to meet with a finance person from on the school side, then you're probably talking about 68% of the budget, but we're only asking for four departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=628.507s">You</a> know, the pre-budget meetings are really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=631.568s">To</a> me, I think they need to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=634.049s">So</a> President Kavya, I'd like to ask you, have you received any update from the administration as to pre-budget hearings or pre-budget meetings with the department heads? <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=644.234s">Is</a> there any type of timeline on that?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=682.26s">at</a> this point, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=684.581s">And</a> I thank you for reaching out on behalf of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=687.461s">I</a> appreciate the attempt. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=688.622s">I</a> find it hard to believe that they haven't, and I'm not saying I don't believe you, but I have a hard time thinking that the administration hasn't talked budget yet and here we are in March. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=698.904s">I</a> mean, the budget hearings, when you think about it, they're probably going to be sometime maybe early June. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=704.265s">So</a> I would think they need to be talking about budget now, and we need to be part of that conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=709.327s">If</a> you take a look at the school side, Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Locke, you on the school committee, you remember this, we had pre-budget hearings. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=717.429s">We</a> met with the department heads in February, March, April. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=720.95s">By</a> the time you got to the budget, there were no surprises. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=725.558s">We</a> need to make sure that's happening on the city side as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=728.519s">So</a> thank you for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=730.639s">I</a> support this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=731.819s">I</a> second the resolution and I would hope that the administration will work with us.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=741.961s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=742.241s">I</a> appreciate you for doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=745.042s">And</a> like I said, this is really important and we need to make sure we're on top of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=749.763s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1308.928s">Thank</a> you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1309.969s">And</a> thank you Councilor Knight for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1311.869s">It's</a> something I truly support. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1313.69s">I</a> think, especially when it comes to budget, it's good to see data and good to see what's coming in with regard to tickets and how they're being, you know, how they're being resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1322.194s">The</a> only thing I would ask if I may, through the chair to Councilor Knight, is it okay if we stagger these so we would get a report <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1330.873s">at</a> the end of May for like early June, just so we have like data for us going into the budget, would you be amenable to that?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1355.148s">And</a> I understand because it'd be nice to get something. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1359.79s">I</a> just would like to see, if we're looking at budget meetings in June, that means that we probably, the latest report we probably have is something that had much data. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1369.933s">And</a> that gives us two months of data that we're not looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1374.255s">So</a> that's why I'd like to get, I think from a budget perspective, we're looking at the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1379.256s">It'd</a> be nice to see something that as of like May month end in June, so we can kind of, <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1384.904s">make</a> more sense of the numbers in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1386.585s">So</a> that would be a suggestion that I would like to see or an amendment or a B paper, whatever you prefer, to have, you know, May data going into the budget.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1446.78s">So</a> if we get, so if we could have like data, you know, so if March could be like a second quarter cutoff.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2375.612s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2376.573s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Biaz for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2379.676s">I</a> agree wholeheartedly with everything that my colleagues have mentioned so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2384.34s">This</a> is a problem that's been going on for years, unfortunately. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2388.499s">When</a> I was in the school committee with Councilor Scarapelli, we were on the school committee for six years, and this is something that we battled with since day one. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2396.804s">Every</a> year, the charter school would have a ton of cash on hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2400.366s">They</a> would literally have cash on hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2401.667s">They</a> would pay for projects with cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2403.708s">Meanwhile,</a> we would scrap trying to figure out how we're gonna pay for different departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2410.132s">We</a> would go with no department heads, no supplies. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2413.734s">I</a> mean, this has to stop at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2416.632s">and</a> the state really needs to get involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2418.872s">And</a> what they really need to do is sit down and come up with a permanent solution to this problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2424.894s">It's</a> not fair that every year, you know, our local schools get hammered over the head because we don't have the funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2435.075s">We</a> could always use more funding, yes, but this is a key component to the formula, to our funding here locally. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2440.997s">And,</a> you know, to lose a million dollars, if not more, <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2443.932s">And</a> it happens year after year after year, it needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2449.355s">Our</a> state legislators need to do something about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2451.857s">This</a> is just wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2454.538s">And</a> Councilor Biarzi, thank you for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2457.42s">And</a> I support 100% move approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2460.481s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2921.019s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2924.252s">Recently,</a> Anthony Bonner, a longtime Methodist resident, probably for about 40 years, lived in the Washington Street Park Street area. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2932.778s">And</a> a longtime resident, someone very dedicated, not only to the community, but also to outside of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2941.103s">He</a> was a member of the Shriners Club, or he was a Shriner, I should say. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2945.386s">He</a> was actually a member of the Fire Brigade Unit, the Aleppo Shriners. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2949.789s">He</a> was a Mason, he was someone who loved his family. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2952.907s">a</a> very family oriented, had many kids and grandkids, and he will be missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2960.112s">So</a> I just wanted to offer our condolences to the Bonner family and offer also offer my thoughts and prayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2967.698s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3555.431s">Councilor</a> Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3556.151s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3557.031s">I</a> also want to thank Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3560.612s">I</a> think it's good to have that option available. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3563.873s">And</a> I think if we follow the Board of Health and the CDC guidelines, and if I know Mary Ann O'Connor, she's going to want to make it as safe as possible, it should be an option. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3576.017s">Not</a> everybody has to take it, but it should be an option. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3578.537s">But</a> I just want to say thank you, Councilor Scarpelli for bringing that forward.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4488.5s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, I want to thank Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this forward I feel like this is kind of like a project that will never end. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4495.067s">We've</a> been talking about it for years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4497.169s">And,</a> you know, it's kind of gone away for a little bit but now it's coming back. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4502.008s">And,</a> you know, you need to get an update, you know, from, from every source with regard to the timing, what's going to happen, who's going to be inconvenienced next. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4511.63s">And,</a> you know, the, the residents should have the opportunity to basically, you know, ask questions and they're impacted the most. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4520.731s">This</a> is a major project and we need to get some answers and we need to get an update from every source. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4526.092s">So</a> Councilor Scarpelli, thank you for bringing this forward tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4529.373s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=5535.332s">You</a> own them outright. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=5536.093s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=5536.733s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=5536.954s">That</a> was my, that's, that was my big question. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=5539.035s">So</a> we own at the end of the lease. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=5541.717s">Perfect.</a> <h2><a href="../2024-11-19_CEBUcuE3cuo/2024-11-19_CEBUcuE3cuo.html">City Council 02-23-21</a></h2>

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=1774.196s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=1775.416s">I</a> received a number of calls over the past week regarding pickleball. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=1779.977s">Pickleball</a> is gaining a lot of popularity. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=1784.638s">It's</a> been around for many years, but I think in our area, it's gaining popularity. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=1789.239s">And</a> from what I've been told, it's gaining a lot of popularity with our senior residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=1796.05s">similar</a> to tennis, but not quite like tennis, it's similar to tennis. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=1801.433s">And</a> like I said, it's become very popular. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=1805.555s">But</a> currently our parks are lined for pickleball. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=1809.297s">So</a> what this resolution is, is actually it's an attempt to basically have our parks lined for pickleball use. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=1820.573s">I</a> watched a meeting that was held by the administration last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=1823.034s">It</a> was an update with regards to our parks and open space. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=1826.755s">And</a> I believe one of the courts at Duggar Park is going to be lined for pickleball sometime in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=1832.977s">And</a> it was also recommended that when Carr Park is reconstructed or renovated, that they will have some sort of a pickleball court for use. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=1844.627s">know,</a> if you take a look at the city of Medford, you know, we have many parks, many parks throughout our community, and all different sections of the city, all different neighborhoods, and we pride ourselves on our parks and open space. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=1856.71s">And,</a> you know, so what this resolution is, it's basically a proposal that all of our tennis courts be lined to retrofitted so that they can be used for pickleball. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=1867.252s">The</a> way I look at it is this would open up use for pickleball and make our our <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=1878.451s">it</a> would give the availability for people to play pickleball in any neighborhood, not just have to go to one particular park. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=1884.573s">And</a> one of the people that he did talk to, he had also mentioned that, they felt that there should be more programming for seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=1891.774s">And</a> I think this is a great opportunity to have programming for our seniors and to have pickleball throughout the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=1898.556s">So</a> when I asked that my Councilors, <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=1901.957s">support</a> this resolution, and I know Councilor Scarpelli has a few words to say about this as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=1907.918s">So</a> at this point, I'd turn it over to my council colleague, Councilor Scott.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2157.571s">If</a> I may, really quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2160.782s">I</a> believe there may be a few people that may want to speak on this issue on the call. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2165.585s">Councilor</a> Knight.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2596.59s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2599.592s">So,</a> each of us has received many, many calls I think throughout the years, each and every one of us with regard to potholes, streets that are in disrepair. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2610.56s">And</a> this year is a program that President Caraviello and I learned about last year at a conference. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2618.666s">And</a> what it is, is it basically takes recycled asphalt, and actually they use it to pave the street again. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2626.405s">There</a> are numerous benefits to the process, shorter construction times, it's easier to use around catch basins and manholes and water valves and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2636.437s">It</a> lowers engineering and traffic control costs as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2640.281s">Last</a> week we received an update from a CFO for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2646.425s">to</a> say the least, the 2022 city budget is going to be a challenge. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2652.329s">So</a> this option that myself and my colleague are putting forth tonight, I think it's just a way to think out of the box to see if there's some way that we can work together to move forward and get some of our streets paved at a reasonable cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2666.077s">The</a> city is struggling for money and revenue, but I think this might be an option to pave our streets or at least <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2675.923s">come</a> up with a pilot program, even if we try doing this to a few of our streets, we should at least try. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2680.986s">And</a> so it's just a cheaper alternative to paving our streets where we currently pave them. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2687.671s">So</a> I actually have additional information for anybody that wants to see it, they can make a copy. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=2694.015s">But</a> at this point, I would ask for your support and I move approval.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=400.474s">Actually,</a> if you could just clarify, what service are they actually providing to the customer?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=413.272s">Okay,</a> so do we know the duration of the project?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=421.035s">Two</a> or three days, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=422.015s">And</a> what's the impact to the residents that live in that area?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=440.462s">The</a> residents going to be notified?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=448.011s">Will</a> they be notified when the work is being done?

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=1061.317s">And</a> if I could add that as an amendment.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=1316.706s">Councilor</a> Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=1318.187s">Thank</a> you, president. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=1321.06s">Councilor</a> Caraviello for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=1323.221s">This</a> is something that definitely needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=1325.623s">We</a> need to receive some sort of an update, but specifically if I could amend the paper to get the timing of the project and when it will be complete, I think that will go a long way in trying to figure out how we can resolve the situation.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2100.016s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2100.856s">I</a> want to also thank Vice President Knight for putting this on the agenda tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2105.178s">This</a> has been a continuous issue, an absolutely continuous issue that has gone on for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2113.022s">You're</a> right, we worked out an ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2114.322s">We</a> have an ordinance drafted. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2115.363s">It</a> passed its first reading, and soon we'll have something in place that has some teeth in it that can help us manage this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2122.006s">But</a> for the time being, this does need to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2125.507s">And</a> it's gone on far too long. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2128.234s">As</a> my council colleagues have mentioned, it's a safety issue, but I think one of the big things is it's a quality of life issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2134.779s">For</a> anyone that lives in that neighborhood, this is a quality of life issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2138.581s">They</a> get up, they have to see this every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2141.083s">One</a> of our residents sent me a video once, it was on fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2144.526s">It</a> was literally fire pouring out of the box. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2147.448s">You</a> shouldn't have to see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2148.849s">I</a> mean, you shouldn't have to look out your window and see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2151.731s">Trash</a> everywhere, things backed up, more outside the box than in the box. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2157.776s">It's</a> ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2158.496s">It</a> needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2159.997s">I</a> asked, I agreed with my colleagues that the code enforcement or someone from the building department needs to contact the owner and really take some action here and make sure that this gets resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2170.063s">But</a> vice president, I thank you for bringing this forward tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2172.945s">And</a> I second the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2174.606s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3637.156s">That's</a> correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3642.517s">So</a> I make complete support of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3644.178s">I</a> know that I offered the original resolution years ago to bring on Todd. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3650.981s">He's</a> done a fabulous job. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3652.762s">I</a> know he's super busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3656.523s">He's</a> always representing the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3659.524s">It's</a> good to have someone at the table that's representing the city on various projects come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3664.006s">Todd's</a> done that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3664.747s">He's</a> done a great job at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3666.808s">I</a> know I've talked to him numerous times just to make various traffic improvements <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3672.685s">within</a> each of the neighborhoods in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3674.946s">And</a> traffic is a real quality of life issue throughout our community, no matter what neighborhood you live in. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3679.908s">And</a> I think it would definitely be good to have someone on board that can help out. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3685.73s">And</a> I move approval, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3688.891s">I</a> second that motion, Mr. President.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_DNuiAY3aRNM/2024-11-19_DNuiAY3aRNM.html">City Council 02-09-21</a></h2>

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1915.613s">Thank</a> you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1917.295s">My</a> thoughts and prayers go out to the Moshe family. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1919.577s">I</a> grew up with Mike and I've been to Victor's many times throughout the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1924.843s">And</a> actually I was talking to my mom just the other day and she was telling me how Mrs. Moshe passed away. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1933.112s">just</a> a remarkable woman and I know you always hear about the food and it's just a great place to eat and great family atmosphere and a big part of our community, although it was right over the line at some level. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1947.741s">So</a> my thoughts and prayers go to the Mosher family. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1951.663s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1952.724s">And</a> thank you Councilor Knight for bringing this forward.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2137.86s">Thank</a> you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2139.581s">Thank</a> you, Vice President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2141.942s">I</a> also want to go on the record of supporting this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2144.143s">I</a> think this is something that's important and it's about providing access to everyone in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2150.166s">I</a> think it will benefit anyone that is hearing impaired, but I think it would also benefit the many people at home that are watching, especially in this day of COVID where we're required to wear masks. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2162.065s">it's</a> going to hopefully help with that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2163.985s">So,</a> you know, I think closed captioning will definitely benefit many people throughout our community and I move approval.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3131.845s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3132.766s">I</a> also want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3135.948s">Of</a> course, a very, very important issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3139.029s">Our</a> community has suffered tremendously. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3143.792s">I</a> think we all know someone who's probably had COVID or unfortunately has passed away from COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3148.98s">We</a> have a high level of COVID-19 in our community, and we have a lot of senior citizens in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3155.549s">And</a> of course, we're getting calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3157.191s">People</a> want to know what's the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3159.294s">And</a> I agree with Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3160.456s">We</a> should be getting weekly updates from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3165.123s">You</a> know, Mary Ann O'Connor has done, she's been working, I know, night and day, probably 24-7. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3171.344s">And</a> I know she's come before us before and given us updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3174.685s">But</a> we really need to make sure we're getting updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3177.366s">Councilman</a> Marks is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3178.766s">People</a> do watch this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3180.666s">A</a> lot of senior citizens watch this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3182.547s">So</a> a lot of times they get their news through this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3186.367s">And</a> we need to know what the message is. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3188.168s">We</a> need to know the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3190.422s">So</a> therefore, when we talk to people, we can distribute that plan as well, make sure that our community knows what's going on, what's the plan, how are we going to move forward as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3202.352s">I</a> have a number of questions, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3204.154s">So</a> if the council wouldn't mind me amending the resolution as well, I greatly appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3209.658s">And</a> I think Councilor Marks already mentioned, you know, do we have plans to host a vaccination site similar to the one of the first responders that was held at the Andrews Middle School? <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3219.246s">So</a> I think Councilor Marks already mentioned that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3222.628s">But</a> my next question would be, I guess, <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3225.538s">You</a> know, has the Method Board of Health or the Health Director been in contact with our local pharmacies or healthcare providers to partner with them to vaccinate residents in phase one, part one of phase two and beyond? <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3240.645s">Has</a> there been any contact with the Board of Health or the Health Director with these pharmacies or healthcare providers? <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3248.468s">Have</a> they contacted Lawrence Memorial Hospital and worked through them, Hallmark Health? <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3255.218s">However,</a> Vanguard, has there been any contact there? <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3260.199s">And</a> one of the other things that, you know, one of the other questions I guess would be, you know, how many vaccine doses are allocated to Medford each week by the state? <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3275.304s">But</a> one of the other questions I guess I have is also, <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3279.622s">If</a> somebody is a city employee, let's take a look at our city employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3283.925s">If</a> a city employee gets sick, do they have a special sick bank for COVID related illness? <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3291.569s">I</a> think that's something that needs to be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3293.63s">And</a> then maybe that's something we could get back from our human resource director. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3299.173s">You</a> know, when people get the vaccine, a lot of people that next day, especially after the second shot from what I'm hearing, there's sometimes not healthcare effects. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3309.728s">people</a> covered under special sick bank time so they can be out. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3316.273s">We</a> want to make sure we're encouraging people to get the vaccine. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3321.776s">Let's</a> make sure that if they get the vaccine and they get, there's an adverse effect or allergic reaction that they cover. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3329.622s">So</a> I'd like to get answers to those questions as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3331.903s">So</a> I respectfully like to amend the resolution if my council colleague wouldn't mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3337.107s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3900.316s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3901.177s">I'd</a> like to begin by just saying this is no reflection on our acting city solicitor, Kim Scanlon. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3909.144s">Kim</a> does a remarkable job. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3910.505s">She's</a> always there to answer questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3911.987s">I</a> have called her numerous times. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3913.328s">So</a> I don't want this to reflect fully on her. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3916.551s">It</a> has nothing to do with her. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3918.753s">But</a> what I want to do is I believe that we need <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3923.373s">We</a> need a line item in the budget, the city council does, to hire an attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3930.455s">And</a> this is basically to help us with our weekly work. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3933.036s">I</a> mean, if you take a look each week, I think more and more when we talk about these issues, we're talking about issues that have legal implications. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3943.078s">There's</a> all kinds of legal type questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3945.519s">And</a> we really need an attorney that's going to be able to help us out with these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3949.78s">I</a> think anybody that's watched the beginning of the meeting until now, we passed three ordinances earlier tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3957.703s">They</a> passed their first reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3959.484s">Three</a> ordinances, and all of them took a tremendous amount of work and time from Kim Scanlon and our legal department. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3968.567s">And</a> they also took the help of KP Law. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3971.268s">I</a> mean, KP Law has helped us with a number of different ordinances that we passed last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3977.151s">With</a> KP Law, you get a different attorney for, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3982.405s">all</a> the different issues that you're working on. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3983.906s">So</a> we need consistency. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3985.726s">We</a> need someone that actually can come in, help us with our work. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3990.068s">We</a> do a lot of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3991.589s">And</a> we need to make sure that it's someone that can work with us week in and week out to help us push our ordinances forward, answer any type of legal questions that come up during our meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4003.494s">And</a> I think it's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4005.875s">We</a> need consistency and guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4008.536s">You</a> know, and the city council will benefit from its own attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4012.737s">I</a> firmly believe in this, I believe this may have been on last year, I'm not sure if I offered it, but it might have been offered by one of my colleagues as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4018.84s">But</a> I really believe that this needs to be part of our upcoming budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4022.822s">So</a> I'd ask respectfully that my council and our colleagues support this, and I move approval.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4579.882s">Thank</a> you, President Caraviello, and I want to thank Councilor Knight for bringing that forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4583.183s">I</a> think it's important that we get more detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4586.504s">I</a> did notice that same thing, that the items in those accounts are rather large, and we haven't seen any particular breakdown with regard to those items. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4595.365s">So</a> I thank him for bringing that forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4598.546s">President</a> Caraviello, I just wanted to ask you really quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4601.666s">So</a> with your amendment, is that specifically an update <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4606.012s">for</a> current spend for this fiscal year, meaning since July.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4730.765s">of</a> so many, the pandemic has caused significant financial hardship to so many. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4735.909s">One</a> of the basic needs of all people is for housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4738.632s">And</a> for so many, this basic need has been undetermined by the possibility of eviction. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4744.832s">Among</a> the attempts to address this need have included the state's pause on evictions that expired on October 7, 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4752.278s">Also,</a> the CDC, Centers for Disease Prevention and Control, established a federal moratorium on residential evictions that I believe will expire on March 31, 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4760.825s">The</a> purpose of my resolution is to prompt a City Council discussion with an eye on passing an ordinance requiring property owners who are serving tenants an eviction notice to include with it a notice of tenants' rights and resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4775.828s">This</a> type of notice would include a description of the various rights of tenants and a list of resources that they may be able to utilize. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4783.47s">All</a> too often, tenants are unaware of their rights and do not know that there are resources available to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4789.832s">Stability</a> requires many things, but first among them is knowledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4795.133s">I</a> ask the council to support this resolution and to focus on a discussion of this subject at a committee of the whole meeting or a subcommittee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4805.237s">I</a> move approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4805.998s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4978.156s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4979.377s">This</a> is a simple request. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4981.037s">We</a> passed the home rule petition on September 22nd, 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4986.12s">And</a> I'd just like to get an update as to if the administration could basically provide an update as to the progress of the home rule petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4996.285s">And</a> if they could provide the following, the date that it was signed by the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5003.562s">the</a> data was sent to the State House, and who the home rule petition was sent to. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5010.788s">If</a> the administration could please update us on those matters, I'd greatly appreciate it.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=617.997s">And</a> that's what I was thinking as well, that it would go to one of those two spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=621.939s">And</a> if I can make it as part of the committee to report that they either go to the Historical Society or the New History Room within the Medford Public Library. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=635.085s">And</a> the other question is, if these funds are approved, when do you foresee the work beginning with regard to the archaeological dig and the work on the <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=646.87s">the</a> Grove Street Wall and the Slave Wall.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=667.838s">This</a> calendar year, do you know specifically, would it be around the summertime or?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=696.757s">Okay,</a> thank you, Mr. Carr.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=699.439s">You're</a> welcome.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1559.146s">My</a> correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1560.026s">If</a> I may, my amendment was to, that either go, the artifacts either go to the Medford Public Library History Room or the Medford Historic Society.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1574.813s">Either</a> or.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=2196.171s">Thank</a> you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=2197.253s">And</a> I want to thank my colleagues for bringing this forward as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=2200.82s">You</a> know, I think back to when this process first started a while back and it got off to a rough start, but then <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=2207.618s">You</a> know, as a council, we really kind of worked with the hospital and the residents to bring this back on, as Councilor Scarpelli said, back on the rails. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=2216.163s">And</a> actually, we had monthly meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=2218.484s">And</a> those monthly meetings were well attended when we had people in the chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=2222.486s">And</a> it was good back and forth between the residents, the council, and the hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=2228.149s">And</a> that went really well. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=2231.371s">You</a> know, and I can't thank enough the members of the CAG, the Community Advisory Group, for all the work that they did representing the neighborhood and for the councils for asking all of their great questions through the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=2245.199s">And</a> it is sad to hear that, you know, maybe things have gone off the rails a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=2250.383s">And</a> I think now more than ever, the hospital really needs to engage with the community <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=2257.767s">with</a> the community advisory group. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=2261.331s">And</a> if there's going to be a second iteration of that group, and there are going to be new members, I think it's important that there is a back and forth, and there is a constant dialogue between the hospital, between the community group, and between the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=2276.686s">Now</a> more than ever, when things, when the project is, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=2282.617s">nearing</a> its point of completion. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=2285.178s">And</a> you're really, I think, going to start to see a lot of quality of life issues that impact that neighborhood on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=2291.08s">And</a> the hospital needs to come to the table and communicate with that community advisory group and the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=2298.063s">And</a> I'm really interested to hear and get an update tonight as to what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=2302.845s">But</a> I really, really believe that now more than ever, we need to make sure that the hospital is engaging with the residents to make sure that we can ensure a good quality of life up in that neighborhood when this comes to completion. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=2319.271s">Thank</a> you, President Caraviello.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3228.593s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3229.76s">Councilor</a> Felkel. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3230.8s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3232.06s">And</a> I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3233.321s">I</a> had to step out of the room for a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3234.541s">So</a> if this question has already been answered, I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3237.441s">But</a> first and foremost, thank you, Mr. Fuller, for your presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3241.422s">And</a> I had a couple of quick questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3242.962s">You</a> had mentioned the soft opening and great surgeons from Tufts Medical and OrthoCare and ENT and Gastro and additional specialists. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3251.704s">Do</a> you have a date like when you would think that this facility will be fully operational with all of these new specialties?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3276.094s">So</a> after this coming March-April, you'll start to see things really ramp up?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3281.378s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3281.758s">And</a> I know there was a question earlier about the branding of this site, you know, people calling it <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3287.712s">Lawson</a> Memorial Hospital, LMH, Circle Health, Hallmark Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3294.176s">Has</a> there been any progress with regard to the branding? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3296.897s">I</a> know we talked about before, I think you mentioned it might be called the medical village. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3301.8s">Is</a> there any discussion as to what the end result is or is that still being talked about?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3340.834s">Do</a> you have any timeline with regard to when that name would change?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3899.613s">I've</a> received calls from residents in the neighborhood about the traffic at the top of Fell's Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3905.414s">And</a> when you approach the top of Fell's Ave, if you're heading down towards Fern Road, that side of Fell's Ave, there are some signs there that say, basically, drive slow, children, school bus, stop ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3922.337s">And</a> at one point in time, there was a crosswalk in front of, I believe it was 185 Fern Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3928.118s">And</a> you can see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3929.89s">It</a> just never got painted again. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3931.671s">It's</a> faded out and it's a section of the road where really you need some sort of I would think crosswalk because that's where the road really widens when you go towards. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3944.076s">Fells</a> Ave or if you bear left, you're gonna go towards Hickory Ave and towards Oak Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3948.7s">So</a> there's a really wide point in the road there that is a... Can be a problem when people cross. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3954.204s">So</a> in the interest of public safety, if we could please have a crosswalk installed by the DPW in that vicinity. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3961.75s">I</a> think that the police could probably weigh in and the traffic engineer as to where it would be best. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3968.576s">But</a> in that section, there used to be a crosswalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3971.518s">So</a> if we could have a crosswalk installed <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3975.523s">in</a> that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3976.144s">I</a> greatly appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3977.106s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4163.89s">Councilor</a> Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4164.87s">Thank</a> you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4166.091s">And</a> I just also wanted to thank Councilor Marks for co-sponsoring this with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4169.893s">And</a> Councilor Marks stressed a point that I think is something that we really need to do, and that's the follow-up, and that's the committee, the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4178.637s">So</a> I definitely agree that we need to do that sooner than later. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4181.619s">Ian,</a> if we could also, I think when Councilor Marks maybe mentioned this a few weeks ago, I just want to reiterate that we need to do robocall as well on that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4190.983s">just</a> like we did with the first one for that same list of streets, same list of residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4197.326s">It</a> would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4197.906s">We</a> had a great turnout at that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4199.206s">It</a> was very productive, and I'm hoping and thinking that this meeting will yield the same results. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4203.928s">So</a> thank you.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_lQjJdcfTNfk/2024-11-19_lQjJdcfTNfk.html">City Council 01-19-21</a></h2>

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=441.185s">Seconded</a> by- If I may, Vice President Caraviello? <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=444.128s">Councilor</a> Felke, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=444.928s">If</a> I may, really quick, and I want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward and supporting it 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=451.033s">On</a> the B paper, are we asking for any specific information, Councilor Bears? <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=454.656s">It</a> just says update. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=455.456s">Are</a> we looking for a number of properties, total balance? <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=459.6s">Is</a> it just, do we want to define this more?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=472.662s">Yeah,</a> if you wouldn't mind, if we could just be a little bit more specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=475.985s">I</a> just wanna make sure we get back the data that we want and not get something that is convenient for them to pull. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=482.971s">So</a> yes, if we could get, let's see. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=488.597s">Yeah,</a> if we could just find out the balance, how many properties are late. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=495.417s">How</a> many people owe penalties, interest, as much data as possible, but those are some specific things that I could think about.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=504.383s">Yes,</a> if I may. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=506.224s">If</a> Councilor Bears is okay with that.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=510.166s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Bears.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=563.539s">Yes.</a>

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=971.238s">Thank</a> you, President Cavioli. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=972.218s">I</a> also want to echo the sentiments of my colleagues and congratulate Officer Botts and Officer Kelly on their retirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=981.003s">Wish</a> them well in their retirement and good luck and thank them for their service. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=984.784s">I</a> mean, when you think about it, three decades in one job is really amazing, especially a job as dangerous as this. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=992.428s">And</a> we thank them for their service, their commitment to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=996.63s">throughout</a> the years and thank you to our first responders for finding the woman who was missing last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1004.958s">So</a> thank you to our first responders and congratulations to Officer Butts and Officer Kelly on their retirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1011.724s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1226.591s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1227.592s">One</a> of the most important responsibilities we have each year is to review and either pass or reject the city budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1235.773s">You</a> know, tonight I offer this resolution to shed light on a process that I think is somewhat flawed. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1242.238s">You</a> know, every year we meet in June with the city of Medford department heads to discuss their budget and discuss the proposed budget for the upcoming year. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1253.547s">More</a> often than not, it's our only formal meeting that we have with department heads throughout the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1261.074s">And</a> I think more often than not, <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1263.803s">Those</a> meetings become more, we're asking questions probably that are more than just budget related questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1268.805s">Sometimes</a> they're policy questions and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1271.566s">So</a> this here tonight is basically a proactive approach that I'm asking President Caraviello if in the upcoming months of February, March, April, and May, if you could schedule pre-budget hearings with each of our department heads to go over their current budget, <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1298.14s">To</a> take a look at the goals and objectives to see if they're accomplishing <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1302.852s">what</a> they've said that their goals and objectives are for this current year. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1307.494s">So</a> basically, it's a proactive approach, and it gives us an opportunity to ask department heads questions that sometimes aren't even budget related. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1317.04s">So</a> it's to hopefully streamline the budget process when we discuss the budget in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1322.603s">So</a> I think that we have to pass this budget, or actually pass or reject this budget each year. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1332.278s">This</a> is really large, and we need to make sure that we have all the information that we need to make that decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1340.605s">And</a> I think meeting with department heads more than once a year is something that we should be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1347.04s">Me</a> meeting them once a year to have a quick budget meeting in June, to me, doesn't cut it. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1352.162s">So</a> I think that what we need to do is budget meetings so we can actually have a nice conversation that is full of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1360.126s">And</a> if there's items that we need to follow up on or they need to follow up on, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1364.348s">We're</a> not doing it last minute in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1367.609s">So</a> therefore, I would ask if you could please schedule budget meetings, maybe two or three a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1376.332s">Starting</a> in February would be ideal. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1379.493s">So</a> I would respectfully ask for my colleagues to support this and I move approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1386.655s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2220.393s">Thank</a> you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2222.114s">Recently,</a> I received calls from residents regarding the C-Click Fix program. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2228.017s">For</a> many people that might not know, that's a program that we use to basically, the residents can enter into any type of issues that they're having, and then they're assigned to the appropriate department head where hopefully they can be resolved in a timely fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2245.005s">Recently,</a> I was notified that <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2249.418s">The</a> issues that were logged by a number of residents were basically cleared out and deleted. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2257.993s">So</a> they no longer appear on the list of outstanding issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2260.775s">And</a> from what I'm hearing, this is the second time that this has happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2264.298s">I</a> think when the previous administration crossed over to the current administration, they cleared out C-Click Fix. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2270.742s">And</a> then when recently, I think they may have an upgrade or something, and they did the same thing, they cleared out issues again. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2278.248s">So</a> what they're doing is basically they're clearing out issues that have never been resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2285.193s">And</a> I think one of the reasons why it was closed was because it was a seasonal issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2289.837s">It</a> may be an issue that couldn't be dealt with because the weather was getting cold. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2293.621s">But</a> from my opinion, that doesn't mean that the issue's gone away. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2298.485s">And</a> I think that's what's happening now is we're losing, there's really no transparency when something like this happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2305.311s">Because</a> if you're just deleting issues because maybe you can't <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2310.09s">take</a> care of them in the wintertime, that doesn't mean that the issue's gone away. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2314.052s">That</a> means the issue still exists, it should still be in the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2318.594s">And</a> then what happens is they get this email back saying that it's a seasonal issue, and then they ask the person, I believe, if it's been resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2329.899s">As</a> far as I'm concerned, that's the city's responsibility, is whether or not an issue's been resolved, because the ticket's been assigned to someone in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2338.926s">So</a> if we could please get an update from the city administration as to what's going on with CClickFix. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2346.568s">If</a> issues are being deleted, why?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2384.512s">Councilor</a> Knight, if you wouldn't mind, what time did that email come in at?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2447.24s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2448.161s">If</a> I may, if I could also amend my resolution to find out what it means when they say fit method and our needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2458.229s">So</a> I guess C-Click Fix needs to work differently in Medford than it does anywhere else. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2462.072s">So</a> I would like to know if they could please specify what that means. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2467.397s">Because</a> I think there's a lot of uncertainty right now as to C-Click Fix, how it's managed, <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2475.333s">how</a> it operates, when you're deleting issues that haven't been resolved, I have a problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2482.438s">Basically,</a> you're saying the issue doesn't exist anymore when it does.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2881.301s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2883.773s">On</a> the motion by Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2887.934s">Thank</a> you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2889.334s">I</a> just want to thank all my colleagues for their support on this here. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2893.155s">And</a> Councilor Knight mentioned, I think, an important part about data-driven decision-making. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2900.256s">And</a> if you don't have the systems in place to give you that data, the decisions aren't going to be, you're really not going to be able to use it as a tool. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2909.938s">And</a> you're right, Councilor Marks mentioned it before about using it as a tool. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2913.121s">It's</a> important to have that tool available. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2915.443s">And</a> Councilor Scarpelli, you hit it on the head. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2917.645s">With</a> regard to resources, if it's not managed properly, it's not going to help anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2924.461s">So</a> if you wouldn't mind, if we could also schedule committee the whole with the administration to actually, if it's training fine, but to learn more about the new system, that would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2933.25s">And</a> to find out what we can get out of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2934.892s">It</a> would be nice to know if there's any type of reporting that we can get out of this system. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2939.316s">I</a> know when we first went to see quick fix, I asked about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2942.199s">They</a> said there was nothing, which I find hard to believe, but I would hope. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2946.052s">Well,</a> I would think that there should be some sort of reporting that we can access to see what's being done, what's not being done, what's being resolved, what we can use, how we can look at the data, what type of calls are coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2958.98s">And</a> it'll really help with the budget process at the end of the year when we take a look at that and see all the work that's been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2968.327s">I</a> know there's work that's getting done. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2970.708s">But</a> I also know that it needs to be managed correctly and if we're just closing tickets for the sake of closing tickets, it's not very transparent and it doesn't mean that the issue goes away. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2981.07s">Thank</a> you everyone for your support, and I move approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2984.612s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3001.481s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3043.934s">Thank</a> you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3046.296s">This</a> is a pretty simple resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3047.837s">It's</a> basically to have Committee of the Whole meeting to receive an update from Republic Parking with regard to the parking program. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3056.083s">and</a> have them answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3058.651s">any</a> questions that we have, but also to provide a financial update with regard to the program to basically see what kind of money's coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3066.695s">And</a> I think it might be best, um, you know, basically maybe if people, maybe if the Councilors could send you questions and maybe you could forward them to, uh, before you schedule the meeting so they can come prepared to the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3080.263s">But</a> it'd be nice to get a nice, uh, receive a financial update from Republic parking.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3292.231s">My</a> goal is to make it, you know, financial update. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3294.652s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3295.053s">And</a> I put answer any parking related questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3298.295s">So</a> it's, you know, if the Councilors do have questions, because sometimes there's questions about parking policies when they ticket, uh, sometimes there's questions about who they hire, what's their turnover rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3309.161s">Um,</a> so these, these are questions that I want to make sure that they are, <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3312.843s">able</a> to answer, so that's why I opened it up to the financial update and the parking-related questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3318.486s">I</a> want to make sure that councilors have the opportunity to ask any questions that they want regarding the parking program.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3569.228s">Thank</a> you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3571.009s">I</a> do agree with this resolution 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3573.812s">People</a> lost their lives on that day, and these actions should be condemned.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3581.438s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3943.825s">I</a> believe it's transparency.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4028.971s">Mr.</a> President Caraviello, thank you, Councilor Knight, for bringing this forward, and thank you for your persistence in getting these reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4034.577s">I</a> did the same thing, I scrolled through and I did notice that there were a number of large numbers in these accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4042.364s">And</a> if the councilor wouldn't mind me amending this, I'd like to know why these papers did not come to us for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4052.508s">Once</a> it goes over a certain amount, it's supposed to come to us for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4055.309s">We</a> did not see any of these papers. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4057.67s">So</a> if the councilor wouldn't mind me amending the resolution, I think that's something that we need to know specifically why these did not come to us.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4389.681s">Thank</a> you, President Caraviello, and I thank Councilor Knight for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4392.743s">And</a> I think, you know, hearing all my council colleagues talking about Mr. McGillicuddy, and you hear the words like volunteerism, community, family, and that's what he was all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4404.33s">I</a> grew up with his daughter, Karen, went to high school with her, and she was a fabulous person. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4409.031s">And</a> I never knew Mr. McGillicuddy until later on in life, until I got involved in elected politics. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4415.572s">And</a> he's someone that you always found helping out, always volunteering, always doing whatever he could do to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4423.474s">And</a> he will be missed, and thoughts and prayers to him and his family.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4988.383s">Thank</a> you, President Calvi. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4989.424s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4991.586s">And</a> I basically agree with all the comments that my council colleagues have made. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4997.651s">You're</a> not going to find a better person than Karen. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=5000.273s">Fabulous,</a> does a great job, very knowledgeable. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=5002.275s">So</a> I just want to say congratulations and wish her well. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=5004.817s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1081.169s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1082.147s">And</a> I'd offer that as a B paper.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1087.871s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1616.045s">Thank</a> you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1617.686s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks, for bringing this resolution forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1620.608s">This</a> is before. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1623.449s">When</a> President Caraviello and I were going back and forth with regard to issues or meetings that need to be scheduled in January, sent him a list of meetings that kind of were <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1637.101s">related</a> to last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1638.141s">And</a> I said, you know, this, in one of these, actually, this was part of the email that I sent to President Caraviello saying we need to make sure we stay on top of this and schedule meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1646.785s">So</a> I would hope that that's going to be coming up soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1650.847s">I,</a> as someone who lives in that neighborhood, have noticed they have made some improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1656.989s">There</a> has been some striping that has been done, signs that have been added, but of course there's more work to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1663.732s">You</a> know, so it'll be interesting to get an update from the administration with regard to short-term and long-term solutions, what's been done, what needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1672.098s">And</a> if I could amend this as well to, that we have a reverse 9-1-1 going to the residents, the same residents basically that we sent the reverse 9-1-1 to when we had the original committee, the whole meeting back in November. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1688.59s">That</a> meeting was well attended. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1690.171s">It</a> was, <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1692.957s">It</a> was nice to actually have that many residents there and talking about the traffic and the issues that are happening in that neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1699.278s">And</a> I know we promised them that we would follow up. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1702.159s">So</a> if we could have a reverse 9-1-1 going out to those same residents, so they know that we're on top of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1709.541s">And</a> if they have any questions, they can ask those same questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1712.502s">And</a> Councilor Marks, if I may, are we going to invite the same people, same department heads as we did last time?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1721.799s">No,</a> no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1723.28s">On</a> the, when we have the updated, when we have the committee of the whole to update. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1727.322s">That'd</a> be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1728.703s">Excellent</a> idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1729.364s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1729.604s">So</a> if I could, if I could amend it as well to invite the department heads that we invited last time. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1735.468s">And</a> if we could all, if we could have the chief of police was invited last time, but if he, if he cannot make it, <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1742.392s">If</a> we can have Sergeant Hartnett, someone from the Traffic Enforcement Division. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1747.817s">Someone</a> really needs to be there to represent the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1751.421s">So</a> if I could amend that to have those people invited, that'd be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=1756.185s">Councilor</a> Marks, thank you for bringing this forward and I would second that motion.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2963.645s">Oh,</a> no, no, I'm good, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=2965.346s">No,</a> no, I'm good, thanks.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3637.087s">I'm</a> all set. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=3637.528s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4478.268s">Thank</a> you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4480.389s">I</a> have known Steve Puccini most of my life, especially growing up with him close to 45 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4487.491s">And</a> I know he's been active in the community through Medford Community Soccer. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4492.533s">So</a> I know he's going to. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4495.868s">be</a> a really a positive impact to the CPC committee and I'd move approval.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_y31vTPCB2oY/2024-11-19_y31vTPCB2oY.html">City Council 01-05-21</a></h2>

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/y31vTPCB2oY&t=1914.625s">Thank</a> you, Vice President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/y31vTPCB2oY&t=1917.667s">And</a> thank you, President Caraviello, for bringing this resolution forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/y31vTPCB2oY&t=1922.011s">We</a> haven't really talked about 40 Bs in a while, and this is a concern, especially if legal fees are mounting. <a href="https://youtu.be/y31vTPCB2oY&t=1929.518s">So</a> I thank you for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/y31vTPCB2oY&t=1931.46s">If</a> the council or President Caraviello, if you wouldn't mind, is it possible to amend the order of resolution to actually have the, I know you asked if I think it was the total legal costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/y31vTPCB2oY&t=1944.298s">The</a> current legal cost, if we could have that by actual 40B, how much we've been charged, and actually how much the city has paid to our representatives, which I believe KP Law is representing the city on each of these. <a href="https://youtu.be/y31vTPCB2oY&t=1957.864s">So</a> if we could get that broken down by property, by each 40B, how much the city has been billed and how much we've actually paid out in legal fees to KP Law or <a href="https://youtu.be/y31vTPCB2oY&t=1971.269s">whatever</a> legal team is representing the city in this matter.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13240.782s">And</a> that's a clarification I'd like to receive. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13243.223s">I</a> think if I could amend the paper further to find out who approved the event originally and <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13250.706s">Who</a> requested the modifications to the event? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13254.548s">I</a> mean, from what I could tell from the research I did, I think the tickets went on sale in October, and the event was, I believe it was December 4th, I think this past Saturday.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13268.436s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13269.376s">And</a> the event changed, I think, right beforehand. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13271.358s">So</a> if we could get some clarification on that, I'd greatly appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13275.48s">I</a> thank Councilor Bearst for bringing this forward and move approval.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13374.876s">While</a> I'm on the council floor, it would be okay to suspend the rules and take a few resolutions out of order.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13512.032s">It's</a> just wide open. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13512.673s">There's</a> one, I believe, handicapped spot in front of Zero Governors Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13518.935s">Two</a> the most, but I know there's at least one.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13526.899s">It's</a> basically just, for me, it's just public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13529.5s">It's</a> just, from what I'm hearing, it's just out of control.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13534.752s">Yeah,</a> so cars have specific spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13537.413s">Right</a> now it just seems like it's a free for all.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2477.776s">Oh,</a> you're closing the fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2479.339s">Okay,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2480.881s">And...</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2483.806s">I</a> kind of, I guess, have a more specific question because I know we had a lot of discussion in our prior meetings about KP Law. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2491.308s">How</a> did those numbers look so far with regard to Q1, what was budgeted versus what was actually spent? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2498.99s">I</a> know there's a lot of projects going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2500.51s">I</a> know we've had a number of meetings for different ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2504.491s">We've</a> had different attorneys from KP Law helping us with each of those projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2508.332s">And</a> I believe they're also helping out on the 40B front as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2511.513s">So</a> I was wondering if you could just kind of comment on that as to where we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2515.119s">Are</a> we in line with what we have budgeted for that specific expense to KP Law?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2562.738s">So</a> if I'm correct, 40 Bs are outside of the $60,000 contract? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2565.08s">The</a> $5,000 a month retainer, yes.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2575.762s">Okay,</a> so can we get a breakdown of that if someone else wants to offer that? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2580.928s">So</a> if I, on the motion of... <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2583.512s">Vice</a> President Caraviello to seconded by Councilor Knight to get a breakdown of the fees so far paid to KP Law under the $5,000 a month contract and with regard to any work that's done, for example, like 40 Bs outside of that.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2610.409s">And</a> if I may, more specifically, Alicia, have we paid any claims in excess of $5,000 this calendar year that did not come before the council for approval?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2628.342s">I</a> apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2629.923s">Any</a> claims against the city in excess of $5,000?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2644.947s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2645.287s">Could</a> you please actually vice-president. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2651.75s">If</a> vice-president Caraviello, if you wouldn't mind, if we could have an amendment to the paper to get a breakdown of all claims that have been paid over $5,000 since January 1st, 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2666.628s">Anything</a> pending? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2669.85s">Seconded</a> by Councilman. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2685.858s">They're</a> all amendments. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2689.639s">And</a> if I may, last but not least, and this is for <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2694.769s">Dave</a> Rodriguez, Chief of Staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2696.03s">I</a> believe Council Knight has asked repeatedly since January 1st for a breakdown of consultants that the administration has hired. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2704.217s">Are</a> we gonna get that breakdown of the consultants, who's been hired, what they're doing, how much they're paid? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2713.585s">It</a> seems to have fallen upon deaf ears. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2715.147s">I</a> know it's a request that's been made numerous times by this council and we have yet to receive any type of documentation.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2738.156s">It</a> was a breakdown of consultants that were hired? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2741.618s">In</a> what they're doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2743.079s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2743.64s">And</a> how much they're being paid?

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4773.243s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4774.785s">Last</a> month we approved a number of papers that came to us from the mayor to <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4779.95s">funding</a> to fix various HVAC issues throughout the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4784.154s">I</a> believe the total amount of the funding we approved was approximately about $800,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4787.756s">The</a> ongoing problems with the air quality throughout our district concerns me not only as a city councilor, but also as a parent. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4796.343s">I</a> have two students, two of my kids are in the Medford Public Schools, two are at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4802.31s">And</a> like many kids, many of their peers throughout the district are accessing the curriculum virtually five days a week because our buildings are not ready to handle the entire student body yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4816.713s">For</a> many students, the schools are a safe place. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4823.415s">They</a> get their food on a daily basis from the Metropolitan Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4827.136s">The</a> emotional support, the health services that they might not actually have at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4831.477s">And</a> I know that the custodians and the buildings and grounds people at the schools have been working really hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4839.019s">And</a> I know the teachers have had the literally Herculean task of trying to teach virtually each day. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4847.421s">And</a> that's not easy, and they've had that task. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4854.269s">We've</a> appropriated the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4855.531s">I</a> think it's time that we get some sort of an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4857.393s">It's</a> been almost two months. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4859.156s">And</a> I know I did have an opportunity to review some of the air quality reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4864.162s">And</a> it looks like they've made some progress at, I believe, the elementary schools, which is promising. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4869.309s">And</a> to that I say thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4872.413s">But</a> I know that there's, it seems to me when I did a quick analysis of the reports that there are, I know I have numerous questions regarding Medford High School and the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4883.817s">And</a> I know David Murphy from the, I believe he's the new superintendent of finance on the school side, is actually on the call tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4892.099s">And</a> I thank him for joining us. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4894.3s">And</a> I believe he's new, so I also welcome him to the Met with Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4898.041s">So</a> if he could just give us an update with regards to what they're doing with regard to the funds that we sent. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4905.184s">Give</a> us a progress update as to what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4907.525s">I</a> have some further questions, but I'd love to hear an update from him. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4910.866s">If</a> you could please unmute him, that would be great.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5708.75s">Yes,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5709.451s">If</a> I may continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5710.271s">As</a> far as the reports go, I've received many calls from parents <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5716.066s">basically</a> asking where can they access the reports? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5718.807s">Now</a> you said they're online. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5719.988s">Can</a> you, I'm not sure if you're able to, and I don't mean to fine tune this to death, but I mean, as far as, are you able to share your screen and show us where these reports are? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5729.492s">Because</a> I've received numerous calls from parents and they can't find them.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5798.462s">Um,</a> so, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5799.483s">Because</a> I've received numerous calls from, uh, from parents saying they can't find their reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5804.187s">They</a> want to see the reports and you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5807.447s">To</a> me, this process really, really needs to be transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5810.848s">And</a> I know that word's used a lot, but this here needs to be transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5815.809s">I</a> mean, we're talking about the health and the safety of our children, of our teachers, our students, our staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5824.85s">I</a> mean, we need to make sure that this stuff is out there so people can see it, and they can access it, and they can make their own decisions and ask educated questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5835.612s">You</a> know, because this is just important. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5838.253s">I</a> mean, this is important now more than ever.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5859.122s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5859.682s">So</a> I have some further questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5861.343s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5864.167s">So</a> when I look at the reports, and I did actually see some of the school committee meeting last night, I noticed I think one of your priorities, which I think is good, is that the vocational school goes back to school sooner than later, especially because the seniors are nearing the end of their, before they graduate, they need to make sure that they're ready to graduate and they're certified to do things they can do and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5887.314s">But</a> when I look at the reports, it looks like the vocational school, if I'm reading this correctly, <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5893.381s">It</a> looks like it hasn't been tested yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5894.762s">Is</a> that true?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5984.61s">Thank</a> you, I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5986.091s">So</a> when I look at the, so I know there were reports that came out previously. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5989.775s">I</a> believe it was maybe mid-September. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5992.318s">And</a> when I looked at the reports, I believe mid-September, I don't think at that time the vocational school was tested. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5998.724s">I</a> don't think that the Karen Theater was tested. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6001.306s">And</a> I don't think any of the three cafeterias at Medford High School were tested either. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6006.031s">When</a> I look at this report here, the most recent one, it looks like that the, like we said earlier, it didn't look like the vocational school was tested. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6015.176s">It</a> looks like the Caron Theater was tested, but it still doesn't look like any of the cafeterias were tested. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6020.018s">Can</a> you confirm that?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6250.524s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6251.405s">Mr.</a> Murphy, so I'm going to go back to the Caron Theater here. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6255.387s">So</a> when I look at my report, to me I'm looking at this and it says the required ACH is 4.0 for the Caron Theater and the actual ACH is 2.97. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6265.612s">So</a> therefore it fails. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6270.354s">Now,</a> I'm under the impression that that space is still being rented every Sunday. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6280.703s">have</a> the people that are renting that building have they been notified that they're in a building where the equality is not really up to par.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6343.38s">When</a> I look at my calendar, okay, it says that these reports were issued on the 20th of October. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6349.945s">So</a> if they were issued on the 20th of October, that means that last weekend, the district knew that the county theater failed, it's the equality, but yet there were still people in the building, utilizing the building, renting the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6365.458s">I</a> mean, is the city negligible for something like that? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6369.469s">And</a> to me, it doesn't seem we're putting health first. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6374.41s">We're</a> still allowing people to rent the building that maybe technically shouldn't be rented.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6430.553s">So</a> when you say there's additional, so you're saying that they added HEPA filters to the counter theaters?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6450.273s">So</a> now the HEPA filters that are there, has the data been tested since the HEPA filters have been added?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6487.634s">So</a> as far as the, I know it's the local church is actually renting the space. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6500.081s">Have</a> they been notified? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6500.961s">Have</a> they asked any questions as to whether or not the building is safe or ready to be used? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6506.164s">So</a> we have not reached out to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6508.426s">The</a> school system has not reached out to them at any point in time.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6523.756s">And</a> we haven't communicated with them anything from MPS?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6537.272s">To</a> me, I would think that the equality is something that should be communicated, but that's just me. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6541.334s">Moving</a> on to the cafeterias. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6543.195s">The</a> cafeterias haven't been tested. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6544.715s">Where</a> are students eating during the day? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6546.136s">There</a> are students in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6547.276s">Could</a> you please comment on that?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6569.059s">So</a> I mean, as we move forward, it is New England, it's getting colder. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6573.442s">So</a> I would imagine even when it starts to rain or snow, eating outside is no longer going to be an option. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6578.666s">So</a> as far as eating in the cafeteria, we're putting in HEPA filters, which are great, and I'm sure that's going to improve the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6586.492s">But</a> how do we know that if the cafeterias have not been tested yet, how do we know that we're putting enough HEPA filters in? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6595.675s">I</a> mean, to me as a parent, that's a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6597.235s">I</a> feel like it's a gamble. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6598.276s">Well,</a> we'll throw three or four and hopefully it does the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6601.196s">I</a> mean, you know, parents deserve answers to these questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6605.397s">And</a> I feel like, you know, and I understand it and you're frustrated. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6608.398s">I</a> think everyone's frustrated with it, but you know, we deserve answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6613.299s">And</a> I feel like, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6615.239s">So</a> a lot of these questions really, I feel like we're guessing at, you know, with regard to the answers.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6649.199s">And</a> the cafeteria is going to be tested at some point?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6673.397s">I</a> mean, when I look at my report, unless I'm missing it, I don't think I see the cafeteria.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6703.129s">So</a> as far as, so as I moved to the report, I also noticed that, <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6710.142s">the</a> nurse, the nurse's office, that from what I can tell, if I look at this report, it looks like it doesn't look like any of that space passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6722.137s">Am</a> I correct?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6725.982s">You</a> are correct.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6745.778s">And</a> have those rooms been retested with HEPA filters?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6761.501s">Do</a> you think we should be retesting the nurse's office?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6816.492s">bathroom</a> safe at the high school?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6837.443s">Did</a> you say many?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6842.625s">Am</a> I correct in saying that most of the space that's being utilized now by the students that are actually going to Medford High School are in the science wing?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6884.103s">If</a> I can ask you a question going back to the beginning, why were the buildings tested so late? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6890.57s">The</a> very beginning, we knew this was an airborne illness back in April, back in April of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6898.199s">And</a> I don't think anyone came in to test anything until August. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6902.52s">That's</a> not a formula for success, that's just too late. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6907.444s">I</a> mean, there are other school districts throughout the commonwealth that are back to school and they might not have their buildings at full capacity, but they're able to utilize their buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6916.952s">I</a> would think that if we're out front, we started testing in the springtime. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6921.676s">You</a> know, when a lot of these companies probably had more capacity to, you know, give us more resources, we probably wouldn't have the opportunity to maybe get in front of this and actually, you know, get our kids into school if their parents are okay with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6937.784s">So</a> can you tell us a little bit about why this started so late? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=6944.083s">And</a> this might even, this might even, this I think actually predates you, but if you could please answer that question.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=7044.556s">If</a> I may, does the, does the board of health have any type of input as to, you know, the cafeterias being tested or not being tested, the bathrooms, that type of thing? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=7055.491s">I</a> mean, have they, have they given any input during this whole process?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=7106.71s">I</a> still think at the end of the day, when you look at the cafeterias, I mean, I know you're talking about a formula, but I would think that these things need to be retested at some point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=7115.854s">You</a> know, as a parent, you want the, you know, the comfort of knowing, okay, you know what, they tested it, they retested it, it's finally up to the point where it passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=7124.677s">And</a> I feel like, you know, I know you're saying, well, they have a formula and it shouldn't pass once we have these HEPA filters in, but I would think that, you know, I mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=7134.212s">You</a> want to retest after the HEPA filters to get the comfort knowing, OK, you've got a good reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=7140.176s">We're</a> ready to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=7140.957s">We</a> can put our kids back in the classroom or back in the cafeteria or back in the Vogue, wherever it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=7147.761s">But</a> I would think that there needs to be retesting at the end of the day.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=7195.965s">I</a> mean, I just, I know at the end of the day, as a parent, I want to make sure that the buildings are safe for my kids to go to school and for everyone's kids to go to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=7204.627s">And</a> I like to see numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=7205.647s">I</a> like to see metrics. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=7206.628s">I</a> like to see that the testing is being done and that these areas are actually passing the test. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=7211.249s">That</a> means a lot to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=7213.029s">I</a> mean, I don't want to just assume that, you know what, they've worked a formula and it looks like you're going to be able to eat lunch today and be safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=7221.075s">And</a> I don't think the option should be in February eating on a snowbank because you've got to eat outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=7225.998s">I</a> mean, we need to make sure that these buildings are tested, the air quality's there, it's at where it should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=7234.504s">And</a> that as parents and as residents and as taxpayers, people feel safe about the buildings.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=7292.602s">Okay</a> so we'll say it's we'll say they're just not ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=7297.285s">As</a> far as the HEPA filters go, do you have enough HEPA filters for the high school and all the other schools? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=7302.57s">I</a> mean, I have a concern that we're going to be just rolling these things around in and out of rooms.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=7363.388s">Is</a> the goal to basically have fresh air without opening a window?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=7409.926s">As</a> far as the, can you say with any confidence that kids will be back <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=7418.315s">Can</a> you say with any confidence that you think kids will be back at Medford High School by the end of the year?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=7430.011s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=7430.111s">I'm</a> not sure if my colleagues have any other questions.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9922.072s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9923.173s">Alicia,</a> one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9925.253s">When</a> you mentioned about the CARES money and how some of the funds are reimbursed, some things are reimbursable and some things are not reimbursable and how things have flip-flopped. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9934.277s">What's</a> the process? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9935.057s">Does</a> the federal government notify you through like bulletins or how do you get notified about that?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9959.061s">So</a> you like just submit questions back and forth?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9989.934s">Thank</a> you for your answer on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=9991.596s">And</a> if I get one final question for Dave, Dave, with regard to the Curtis Tufts, is that, I've been told that they're using fans down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10000.305s">Is</a> that true? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10000.866s">Do</a> they have HEPA filters at the Curtis Tufts?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10031.378s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10033.28s">I</a> thank you for answering all the questions tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10035.001s">I</a> know they're not easy, and I know you're all there. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10038.324s">But</a> there are many concerns throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10041.507s">My</a> council has great questions, and I appreciate the answers that you gave. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10046.992s">And</a> look forward to hopefully another update soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10050.796s">So</a> I thank you very much.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10079.133s">Dave</a> Rodriguez.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10086.552s">Thank</a> you, Dave. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10087.573s">I</a> appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10089.074s">Quick</a> question. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10089.554s">I</a> noticed recently, I think the mayor released an update video with updates that were going on in the city, and there were some good things on there, but there was no update with regard to the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10103.682s">I</a> mean, that is part of the city, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10105.723s">I</a> would think that that should have been part of that presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10108.865s">Am</a> I wrong?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10143.67s">Yeah,</a> well, I would think that a comprehensive update would be comprehensive and involve the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10150.337s">And</a> the school, when you think about it, the budget that comes before us is a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10155.181s">And</a> it's a big part of our city, the Medford Public Schools is part of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10159.265s">And</a> I would think that that update should have been included. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10163.356s">Like</a> I said, there were some good things in there, but there needs to be updates on everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10167.417s">And</a> I mean, sometimes it's bad news, but there should still be an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10172.178s">The</a> parents of the residents of the city deserve an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10175.099s">And</a> I think that that should have been included, and I would hope that that's included in the next update.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10486.48s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10487.04s">We</a> have a number of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10488.02s">You</a> have Councilor Morell, Councilor Bears, Councilor Knight, Councilor Morell.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10534.154s">Okay,</a> I'll try to unmute you, Ann, one minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10536.895s">Oh,</a> there we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10537.535s">Ann,</a> you have the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10545.975s">I'm</a> sorry.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11968.02s">Okay,</a> so Clerk Hurtubise, he sent me a message saying he needed clarification on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11974.544s">Clerk</a> Hurtubise, are you okay with that?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11982.018s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11984.762s">One</a> minute, please.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12202.722s">Robert,</a> I guess the question the councilor tonight is asking is how much money is in the affordable housing category.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6295.969s">And</a> I asked the city solicitor today if she could be present tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6299.071s">She</a> said she could not. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6300.492s">But</a> we can try giving her a call if you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6302.133s">We</a> can take a brief recess. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6303.553s">I</a> can try getting her on the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6305.675s">Is</a> that what the council would like to do?

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9520.196s">You</a> are correct.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9522.877s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9525.39s">And</a> if I may, I thank Councilor Morell for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9529.633s">And</a> I know a number of councilors, Councilor Marks, in particular, and myself, I've brought up numerous resolutions about the 325 and the 326 bus for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9537.658s">I've</a> been a passenger on that 325 and the 326 for probably <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9545.803s">Probably</a> just about 20 years now, and like Consular Marks mentioned, these bus routes have become more and more popular pre-pandemic than I've ever seen since I've been taking them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9559.373s">And</a> one of my biggest concerns is when they said they were going to temporarily suspend service, that they would never bring service back. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9569.08s">That</a> seems to come to fruition now, and I did give Representative Donato a call today to talk specifically about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9577.569s">And</a> he basically told me the same thing he told Councilor Scarpelli, and that is that the MBTA lied to him and to the whole entire state delegation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9585.839s">It's</a> very unfortunate. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9587.34s">I</a> know he is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9589.883s">Representative</a> Donato and the rest of the state delegation is fighting to bring this bus service back, the 325 and 326. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9598.209s">I</a> know they're working hard at it, but it's very unfortunate that the MBTA has done this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9605.354s">And</a> I think knowing the MBTA, when we try to bring it back, they're not just going to bring it back, they're going to probably want all kinds of proof that ridership is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9613.379s">And</a> that's a piece I think that's going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9617.082s">Probably</a> we had to prove because right now ridership is low due to the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9622.163s">So</a> Councilor Scarpelli, I like the idea of scheduling a subcommittee to look at this and bring in the state delegation and bring in the MBTA and ask really good solid questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9635.166s">And</a> really getting them to commit to a timetable as to when they're going to bring things back or when they're going to reevaluate. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9644.728s">But</a> this needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9647.188s">And</a> it needs to be addressed sooner than later. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9649.649s">So,</a> Councilor Morelle, thank you for bringing this forward tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9652.431s">And</a> at this time, I would call upon Councilor Bears.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12225.63s">That's</a> enough, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12226.891s">That's</a> enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12228.69s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12231.733s">We've</a> debated this, I think everyone's had three times by now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12235.196s">What</a> I want to say is this, and I'll be the final word on this, and that is that I have met with <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12244.838s">We've</a> gone back and forth all over the phone with Marian O'Connor, with Kimberly Scanlon, and we're doing everything that we should be doing, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12252.601s">I</a> have made sure of that, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12255.202s">So</a> what I will be doing now, and I'll tell you this much, is I will be meeting with them again because maybe we'll have a committee in the hall about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12266.606s">That's</a> what we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12267.586s">But</a> I mean, I have gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12270.627s">spent</a> a ton of time going back and forth with each of the department heads, making sure that plexiglass goes up, making sure that everybody's seated in the right spot, working with Patrick Gordon to do all the technology piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12284.014s">This</a> has not been an easy task, but <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12286.855s">If</a> I go back at the past meetings, everybody was pretty much on board with getting back in chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12292.777s">So</a> what we have been doing is we've basically been following the rules that have been put in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12298.98s">So</a> with that being said, to get us all on the same page, we can meet with our department heads again. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12306.023s">But</a> to tell you the truth, there are some cities and towns that are meeting, actually, and having the public here as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12312.666s">Now,</a> I've been told by our city solicitor that we can't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12317.498s">Okay,</a> the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12320.99s">I</a> do have that, and I can send that to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12323.652s">But</a> with that being said, the opinion was that the room's got 25 people in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12329.276s">If</a> 30 people show up to the meeting, we can't kick people out of the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12332.798s">And</a> therefore, we would be limiting speech and be limiting participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12337.961s">So</a> it would be a violation of the open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12340.323s">And</a> that's why we're here tonight, and the public is coming in through Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12344.446s">That</a> is the reason I got from the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12348.148s">So</a> with that being said, that's where we are with that, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12352.992s">So</a> we have a number of people that want to ask questions on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12355.875s">I</a> will call on that now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12356.916s">William</a> Navarre, name and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12360.419s">You</a> have a minute and a half.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16821.543s">If</a> I may, I know as the president, I don't comment on too much and I pretty much preside over the meetings, but I just want to say that I believe emphatically that black lives matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16834.673s">However,</a> I do have some serious concerns about the council's authority to approve or disapprove putting a flag or banner on city hall property. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16843.079s">There</a> are no guidelines in place regarding which flags or banners are permitted. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16847.87s">And</a> I do need that this I do believe that this needs to be established outside City Hall is a pride flag that went up. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16855.172s">I</a> don't think it went up with a council vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16857.053s">But</a> I want to support that flag too. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16858.974s">And</a> I personally understand its significance to the LGBTQ community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16863.331s">as</a> a father of a gay child. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16865.593s">But</a> what happens next week if a petition is made to fly a straight pride flag? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16870.777s">Because</a> yes, they do really exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16873.259s">I</a> don't believe it's within the council's purviews to choose which flags are raised without pre-existing guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16880.425s">The</a> city council has no jurisdiction whatsoever over City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16884.928s">We</a> have no jurisdiction, absolutely none. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16888.413s">As</a> a city council, we don't even have control over the thermostat in city council chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16893.057s">And</a> that's a serious statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16894.959s">So</a> we have no control over the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16897.461s">But</a> I just wanted to just issue that small statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16901.685s">But</a> we do have a number of resolutions before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16905.929s">The</a> first one was offered by Council of Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16910.578s">And</a> I'll read it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16911.398s">Whereas</a> systemic racism is an ongoing public health crisis that necessitates urgent action and whereas statements of solidarity and support can begin to address the history of racism and discrimination in our community and whereas residents of Medford have requested <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16927.533s">that</a> the city take this action now. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16929.896s">Therefore,</a> be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the city of Medford will hang a banner reading Black Lives Matter on the front of City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16939.685s">That</a> was offered by Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16941.687s">Does</a> that resolution have a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16944.89s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16946.071s">Second</a> by Councilor Morell.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17025.481s">Councilor</a> Bears, I don't think yours had a second because they specifically said- Mr. President, the record still reflects, Mr. President.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17036.564s">Okay,</a> so Councilor Pietrangelo, there was no second when you mentioned your resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17043.006s">I</a> asked for a second, there was no second. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17045.527s">That</a> has been reflected in the minutes as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17048.148s">And</a> then at that point, I believe maybe Councilor Knight spoke next.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17068.1s">The</a> clerk does not have it in his notes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17069.821s">And</a> I don't remember that part either, because I don't, I specifically stated- Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17076.487s">Excuse</a> me? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17076.787s">Gentlemen,</a> point of order.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17083.292s">Okay,</a> so that means that Councilor Marks' resolution would come up next. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17089.017s">Could</a> you read back the resolution, Councilor Marks? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17091.679s">I'm</a> sorry, Clerk Bernabe.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17160.239s">Can</a> you restate that, please?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17168.185s">I</a> mean, I think that is something that could be done.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17187.19s">Point</a> of order, Councilor Knight.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17217.179s">Councilor</a> Bears, I have in my notes here that <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17220.896s">There's,</a> I have nothing, so what happens is my notes here, I usually write down, it says offered by Councilor Bears, and I usually put slash in whoever makes the second. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17229.922s">I</a> have no slash, I have no second. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17231.944s">And</a> then I have Councilor Marks, he made his resolution and it was seconded by Vice President Caraviello.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17315.17s">Yes,</a> five in the affirmative, two in the negative, the motion passes.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=23464.571s">There</a> are certain things that we talked about tonight that actually have to be done by a certain date.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=23519.183s">I</a> wasn't stating rules, but what I'm saying is there are a boatload of things that have to be discussed in committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=23526.165s">I</a> asked, I asked clerk Herbies, I think probably two weeks ago, and he sent me the list of everything that's in committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=23533.408s">So</a> there's quite a few things in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=23535.189s">We</a> will meet on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=23536.11s">I</a> promise you that.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=698.612s">So</a> the paper, as far as I'm concerned, the paper is not in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=704.674s">I</a> would ask that it be tabled and put on the agenda next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=708.556s">As</a> far as Councilor Knight's question about meeting with the administration, I have sent emails off to the Board of Health Director earlier today. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=718.34s">I</a> talked to Patrick Gordon earlier today. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=724.322s">There</a> were very brief conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=727.677s">My</a> opinion is this, I know we need to get this done. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=731.698s">We</a> need to pass a budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=733.218s">We</a> are against really hard time, a tough deadline now. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=738.939s">So</a> we need to get this done. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=740.84s">We</a> need to work together. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=743.88s">But</a> in my eyes, Zoom needs to be a component of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=748.581s">It</a> absolutely needs to be a component. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=751.682s">At</a> the past three budget meetings that we had or attempted to have, this morning I believe, I'm sorry, <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=760.166s">But</a> an hour ago, we had 189, close to 200 people on the call. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=764.73s">Last</a> night, it was close to 90. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=767.132s">Saturday</a> morning, 50 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=768.913s">50</a> people jumped on the call on Saturday morning to listen to a budget hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=774.177s">I</a> have to be honest with you, in all my years of city government, I've never seen that much interest in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=779.382s">It's</a> nice to see people are involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=782.484s">They</a> want to be part of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=784.306s">That's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=785.307s">I</a> love it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=786.379s">And</a> I'm happy that everyone attended. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=789.422s">It's</a> unfortunate that we couldn't have the meeting, but I'm happy that everyone attended. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=793.085s">And</a> so I don't mind personally meeting with Vice President Caraviello, the mayor's office, you know, Marian O'Connor, Patrick Gordon, to see if this is something that can happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=805.295s">But</a> I will state again, Zoom has to be part of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=810.74s">And</a> more than willing to- <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=814.995s">Councilor</a> Marks, I think I heard your voice.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1229.292s">So</a> I did hear back from the chief of staff today. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1234.055s">So</a> I believe what we're going to do is meet on Saturday with, I think it's going to be police, fire, DPW, and then <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1245.274s">The</a> next meeting will probably be probably next Monday and probably do committee on Tuesday and maybe next Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1254.538s">I</a> haven't kind of got that far yet as far as the scheduling piece goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1258.55s">As</a> far as getting it to City Hall, I'm working on that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1263.254s">And</a> as far as budget books, I've been told we should receive a budget book Thursday afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1272.401s">One</a> of my concerns is if we don't get a budget book, <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1276.215s">until</a> Thursday night, is that going to give the council enough time to review to take up police fire in DPW, which is kind of like the big three on Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1287.084s">So</a> that's my concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1288.385s">I'm</a> kind of wrestling with whether or not, you know, if we don't get that budget book, I mean, I want to make sure to me, the way I look at it is this, especially if we're going to be looking at a budget, we want to make sure that the council has enough time <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1301.1s">to</a> look at the budget for those departments that we're going to meet with on Saturday to process the information and ask, you know, good questions and have a good, you know, truthful discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1311.994s">You</a> know, if we get the budget book, you know, late, that's not going to be beneficial to anyone that's involved in this process.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1320.223s">Point</a> of information.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1348.558s">And</a> that's my concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1349.539s">So</a> I, to be, to be honest with you, I apologize for interrupting. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1353.721s">I</a> don't know yet if that Saturday is going to be police fire and DPW that I think needs to probably be juggled around because of the, uh, the timing of the book. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1363.366s">It</a> doesn't really make sense to have three big departments, you know, and we have minimal time to review. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1369.429s">So,</a> so I completely hear what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1373.511s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=3921.511s">Thank</a> you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=3923.172s">I</a> bring this resolution tonight because I have received numerous emails regarding the 325 and 326 bus routes. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=3931.837s">This</a> is a, it's actually also a bus route that I take on a daily basis when I'm working. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=3937.02s">And</a> I know Councilor Mark says too, we're longtime riders and there are many, many people that depend on these bus routes on a daily basis to get to and from <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=3949.635s">Boston,</a> and they're very convenient to the people in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=3953.817s">And</a> there are many members of our community that depend on these bus routes on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=3960.74s">Now,</a> I've received messages that they're being eliminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=3964.141s">I</a> also received a phone call today from Representative Donato, who told me they were being temporarily taken out of service. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=3971.665s">He</a> did tell me, actually he assured me that <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=3975.467s">that</a> they would be reinstated in mid-July, which to me, it felt better about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=3983.496s">But</a> still with that being said, I know the MBTA has been trying to eliminate these bus routes for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=3992.606s">I</a> know they tried to eliminate them twice before. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=3996.87s">And</a> we fought back actually at one point with the help of the clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=4000.992s">He</a> helped us out with it and we were able to maintain those bus routes and keep them servicing West Medford and North Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=4012.478s">And</a> like I said, these are important bus routes. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=4015.28s">I</a> just wanted to make sure that they're not eliminated completely. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=4019.274s">I</a> know the MBTA has been trying to eliminate them. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=4022.175s">I</a> know Representative Donato says it's temporary. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=4024.997s">But</a> to me, I still have concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=4027.098s">It's</a> the MBTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=4028.318s">I</a> know they're trying to save money. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=4029.539s">I</a> just want to make sure they're here for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=4031.58s">And</a> that's why I wanted to hear from a representative from the MBTA that could explain further. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=4038.883s">I</a> know that ridership has been down during COVID-19. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=4042.765s">But</a> I still have concerns that they're going to be eliminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=4047.608s">So</a> that's why I bring this forward tonight.

<a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=957.349s">The</a> answer, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=959.13s">While</a> the pavement condition index, the PCI project is set to begin this summer, the mayor has asked the DPW commissioner and city engineer for a list based on their experience of sidewalks that are in the most need <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=972.87s">of</a> replacement, the sidewalks to be replaced and selected by using the following criteria in no particular order. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=981.992s">One,</a> age of the request. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=984.092s">Two,</a> condition of the surrounding sidewalks and driveway aprons. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=987.593s">Three,</a> geography, an attempt is made to spread it out equitably throughout the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=998.677s">Part</a> B to the question, if there is a list, what percentage of the work on this list is being done with this $500,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1006.963s">The</a> answer, it depends on the on the ground conditions for each sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1011.347s">The</a> hope is to stretch the work as far as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1014.389s">Last</a> year, the city was able to replace 232 sidewalks of varying lengths under the current contract in 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1022.976s">Part</a> C, is there a priority list? <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1025.378s">The</a> answer is yes, based on the criteria above. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1028.616s">Part</a> D, when will the work take place? <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1030.957s">Answer,</a> upcoming construction season. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1034.639s">Number</a> three, Councilor Morell offered an amendment requesting answers to the following questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1041.062s">A,</a> can the administration please clarify what phase three is and are there additional phases? <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1047.805s">B,</a> does the administration anticipate making another request for funding sidewalk repairs and to when does that carry us? <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1056.43s">The</a> answer is, <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1057.857s">that</a> this is the second part of a two-year contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1061.16s">Sidewalk</a> repair replacement is constantly needed and subject to availability of funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1068.547s">Number</a> four, Council appears off an amendment requesting answers to the following question. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1073.632s">How</a> does this project in its funding fit into the COVID-19 impact on city finances? <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1078.837s">And</a> does this funding request need to be pared back? <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1082.702s">Answer,</a> the administration is currently working on understanding the extent of COVID-19 we'll have on our city finances for current and future fiscal years. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1092.485s">A</a> request has been put forth to complete a current contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1096.767s">The</a> city's finance team believes that this is within our capacity at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1103.149s">Question</a> five, what is the current free cash balance? <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1106.19s">The</a> answer is approximately $12 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1109.697s">Number</a> six, what is the city's current bonding capacity? <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1113.76s">The</a> answer, the city is authorized to borrow up to 5% of the equalized values in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1119.525s">City</a> is currently borrowing less than 1% of the EQB. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1124.309s">The</a> city's borrowing capacity currently exceeds $500 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1129.673s">So</a> those are questions that the administration, well actually these are the questions and answers, the answers from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1138.293s">At</a> this point in time, I'll recognize Councilor Marks.

effective immediately and shall remain in effect until rescinded or until the state of emergency is terminated, whichever happens first. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=519.385s">Okay,</a> thank you for listening to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=523.213s">So</a> as we move forward, and I open up the meeting tonight, I'd like to, before we move forward with the meeting, this week, the city lost one of our, someone actually very special to our city, and that is Joe McGonigal. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=544.085s">For</a> those of you that don't know Joe McGonigal, <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=546.534s">He</a> was a city clerk from 1967 to 1996. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=550.976s">That</a> spans four decades, almost 30 years of service to our community in that one capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=562.683s">And</a> for those that knew Joe, he was a pretty <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=567.119s">uh,</a> you know, pretty amazing guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=569.26s">I</a> mean, I didn't get to know him till after he retired his clerk, but, uh, very nice man, uh, active in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=577.304s">And,</a> um, I think we should, uh, start this meeting, uh, you know, by having a moment of silence for him. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=583.662s">But</a> I just think that he should be recognized for someone who served as long as he did. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=588.744s">That's,</a> you know, from 1967 to 1996 is a very long time and he was very committed to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=596.628s">And</a> so I think we should start off by having a moment of silence for him. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=601.109s">But</a> I would first also like to recognize Vice President Caballero.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4320.399s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4321.821s">As</a> Councilor Caraviello noted, we actually talked to the representative, or representative at the MMA conference. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4330.287s">And</a> it's definitely, I think, something that we should pursue. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4333.149s">And</a> that's why we're recommending a pilot program, thinking that this would be a nice idea to try out on some of our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4341.555s">It</a> would definitely save the city some money. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4345.137s">And</a> it definitely has some benefits as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4348.179s">I</a> mean, if you take a look at the number of streets that we're repaving each year, we're very limited to what we can do with the funds that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4355.062s">So</a> this is kind of an out-of-the-box, kind of thinking out-of-the-box type of solution where we could do something with the recycled asphalt. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4365.067s">And</a> there's definitely some benefits to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4368.249s">It</a> uses in-place materials that are already there in front of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4372.452s">They</a> actually do it all right there, recycle it right on site. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4375.474s">And</a> like I said, it saves money. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4377.255s">It's</a> a shorter construction time to actually repave a road. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4381.297s">And</a> it's easier to work around catch basins, manholes, water valves, and other type of things that you'll find in the middle of the street when you're repaving a road. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4391.143s">And</a> it also lowers the engineering and traffic control costs as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4395.725s">So</a> this is an idea that we wanted to bring forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4397.986s">We</a> think it would be beneficial to our community and actually save the community money as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4403.088s">So</a> at this point I'd like to move for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4407.67s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4717.134s">Yeah</a> that If I may I think there'll be a pretty big capital cost to buy that machine I think the best thing in my own speak for Councilor caviar, but I think we would agree in this I think through the pilot program if we could pick out You know a handful of streets that this probably bring in a rep from one of these companies because I'm sure there's many that do it and actually talk to them and <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4738.115s">and</a> see, well, what type of streets will this work on? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4740.68s">And</a> then pick a handful of streets, come up with a pilot program, and just resurface those streets with recycled asphalt. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4747.785s">And</a> then, of course, get a price. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4749.467s">So</a> I mean, get a price beforehand. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4750.988s">But</a> see how many streets we could do. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4754.231s">Try</a> to figure out if we could have like a, the mayor has some sort of a budget for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4758.895s">And</a> then see what we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4760.236s">And</a> it's definitely more efficient, I think, in lower cost than what we're doing now. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4764.66s">We</a> have very limited funding, chapter 90 funding for street repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4768.604s">So</a> I think this would hopefully allow us to do more streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4772.987s">just</a> make our money go further, so I think developing a pilot program around this would be something that would be beneficial.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5032.595s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5035.016s">And</a> this here is another solution where it's just a more efficient solution, where it's not going to cost as much money. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5045.72s">Because</a> with a lot of these trip sidewalks, trip and fall sidewalks, it's just an edge that pops up. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5051.963s">So</a> what they do is they literally cut the edge, flatten it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5055.304s">They</a> don't have to replace the whole panel. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5057.165s">It</a> doesn't take days, it literally takes probably hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5062.288s">The</a> sidewalk's not out of service, it's not costing you as much money because you don't have to replace the whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5067.031s">You</a> don't have to worry about someone destroying the cement when it's trying to dry. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5070.614s">So</a> it's definitely more efficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5072.655s">It's</a> a concept that's used in other communities, Cambridge, Quincy, Newton, Lowell, Salem, Swampsford, Haverhill, Westfield, Peabody. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5081.539s">So</a> that's just some of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5083.8s">They</a> use this, I guess, at Gillette Stadium as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5087.222s">And</a> they use it at different colleges, BC, UMass, Lowell. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5093.865s">So</a> there's a bunch of colleges that use this as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5096.507s">So</a> it's definitely more efficient for our community, and it would save the community money as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5101.33s">So</a> I'd just like to move the paper forward at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5105.033s">Move</a> for approval.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4769.946s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Caraviello.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4786.32s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4788.702s">As</a> we all know, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4791.527s">Our</a> fine city has become a very popular place to rent, buy a home, or raise a family. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4796.63s">Being</a> only five miles north of Boston, Medford is a very desirable location with great schools, direct access to Boston, and access to a lot of green space. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4807.216s">We</a> also know that to buy a home in our community, it takes a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4812.039s">Homes</a> that once sold for $300,000, $400,000, $500,000 are now selling for $600,000, $700,000, $800,000, if not higher. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4818.609s">And</a> I know as I walk and see people throughout the community, this always comes up as an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4824.974s">And</a> a lot of people ask, well, where will the kids that are growing up today in our city, will they be able to afford to buy a home here in our city, a city that we all love? <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4834.561s">And</a> that really becomes a really tough question to answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4838.945s">And</a> if you go online, you'll see many articles regarding the housing crisis, not only in Boston, but also in the greater Boston area, but here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4848.531s">Tonight,</a> I ask my colleagues to support this resolution that I offer tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4852.293s">I</a> firmly believe that it's time that we establish an affordable housing trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4857.436s">Although</a> the concept is not new, there are many communities throughout the Commonwealth that have shown increased interest in forming their own municipal housing trust funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4869.262s">In</a> 2005, the state legislature passed the Municipal Affordable Housing Trust Fund law to simplify the process of establishing local housing trust funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4878.391s">Since</a> the law passed, 98 communities in Massachusetts have established Municipal Affordable Housing Trusts, raising the overall total number of communities with housing trust to approximately 109. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4893.162s">Examples</a> of what a local affordable housing trust can do include provide financial support for the construction of affordable homes by private developers, both for-profit and not-for-profit, rehabilitate existing homes to convert to affordable housing, increase affordability in new housing development projects, develop service municipal land or buildings, preserve properties faced with expiring affordability restrictions, <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4923.139s">and</a> support rent assistance for low and moderate income households. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4928.565s">What</a> funds can local housing trusts use? <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4932.189s">The</a> sources of funding can vary. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4934.692s">You</a> can use community preservation CPA funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4938.335s">They</a> can use inclusionary zoning payments, negotiating development fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4943.372s">developer</a> fees, the municipality's general fund, tax titles and sales, payments from special bylaws and ordinances, cell tower lease payments, private donations, that's to name a few. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4958.504s">But</a> it seems like in most communities, CPA funds are definitely, you know, what's used I think most of the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4965.09s">So</a> in your package tonight, I included a boil plate template of some draft language <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4971.147s">that</a> we could use to establish a Municipal Affordable Housing Trust Ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4975.353s">Now</a> this is an extant stone. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4977.433s">I</a> mean, what I'd like to see is us as a committee meet to actually work through this ordinance and actually develop something that's gonna benefit our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4989.196s">There</a> are many resources that we can use to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4993.977s">So</a> this is just a boilerplate template of what we need to do and what one would look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4999.978s">So</a> at this point, I would ask my council colleagues to support this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=5005.36s">And</a> I would ask that we move this <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=5008.14s">to</a> the committee the whole and the reason why I don't want it to go to ordinance committee or I wish for it to go to committee the whole as I think this is a great learning opportunity for all of us over the next you know I think during this term there's going to be a lot of issues that come before us with regard to zoning with regard to housing and I think it's important that we all work on this together because I think this is going to benefit our community we should all have a say in this so at this point I would ask <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=5034.957s">my</a> council colleagues to support this, and if you could move this to Committee of the Whole for further review and debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=5042.305s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=5237.532s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Caraviello, and thank you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=5240.853s">Those</a> are just options. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=5242.553s">I'm</a> not recommending that we do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=5244.914s">Like</a> I said, this is a boil plate. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=5246.754s">It's</a> something to look at to get the conversation started. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=5250.135s">That's</a> why it would go to committee of the whole to actually go through those list of options of what's available to us, not holding us to anything here. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=5257.976s">Nothing's</a> etched in stone here. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=5259.577s">This</a> is just some of what other communities have used. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=5262.097s">I</a> just literally went through a list of things that I saw in the research that I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=5266.838s">But</a> I'm not saying we have to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=5269.779s">I</a> completely understand your concern and it's valid, but I was just laying it out there as options of what other communities have done. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=5278.782s">But</a> by no means am I saying that anything is final here. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=5281.963s">This</a> is boilerplate, sample language, sample ideas, that's all it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=5286.825s">My</a> goal tonight is basically just to get everyone on board of You know moving this to committee the whole so we can talk about it and work through and build an ordinance of our own That's basically the goal for tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=5297.829s">There's</a> no specifics as to what I want to do here with regard to You know how we would spend the funds or obtain the funds or anything like that So, thank you.

Okay, so on the motion of Council of the Night, to move the Medford City Council meetings from Tuesday night <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4920.23s">to</a> Wednesday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4924.093s">Seconded</a> by Councilor Scarpelli.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4940.887s">That's</a> a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4941.988s">I</a> am not entirely clear on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4943.229s">I'd</a> have to check. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4944.41s">One</a> minute, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4946.992s">I</a> don't think so either. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4960.396s">I</a> believe this is a simple majority.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4973.752s">Have</a> some remarks.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5027.374s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5060.157s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Knight.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5064.14s">Yeah,</a> I don't see anything in the rules either. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5065.882s">So</a> this requires a simple majority, but I, I, <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5071.194s">If</a> you don't mind me speaking from the chair, I would think something, this is a momentous vote because we're really changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5076.939s">And</a> there have been great arguments made on both sides with regard to moving it and not moving it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5084.727s">So</a> there have been some great arguments here. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5086.989s">Some</a> that I didn't even think of. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5087.97s">So</a> parking was one of them, which I thought was a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5094.396s">You</a> know, you come in on a Wednesday night, you come in on a Wednesday night, it is tough to find a spot and you have to go across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5100.322s">And</a> sometimes when there's major issues being discussed, you know, parking can be a challenge. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5105.668s">I</a> would think that something like this, though, should move to committee just to kind of flesh it out some more as to <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5111.955s">You</a> know, if it doesn't move to Wednesday night, maybe we should look at suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5116.658s">Maybe</a> we should look at the rules a little bit more and, you know, see if there can be changes made to make the process more efficient.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5131.269s">So,</a> actually, Councilor Marks.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5187.873s">That</a> is stated in the rules of the city council.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5192.755s">That's</a> not... That is not a rule. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5195.156s">It's</a> a simple majority, but a change of this magnitude, I would think, should go to either committee of the whole or subcommittee for further vetting.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5214.839s">So</a> there is a motion from Consular Knight?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5217.28s">Consular</a> Knight, would you like to keep that motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5219.781s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5220.541s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5220.962s">So</a> on the motion of Consular Knight to move the Tuesday night meeting to Wednesday nights, seconded by? <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5227.685s">Second.</a>

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=5819.769s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=5823.551s">This</a> is a very frustrating issue, without a doubt. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=5828.254s">When</a> we offered this resolution back a couple of months ago, I think it was a smart thing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=5833.938s">Tap</a> the brakes, hit pause, let's take a look at all of our spending with regard to the library, the police station, the fire station, the potential build-outs of the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=5845.746s">And</a> during that time or since then, we met numerous times. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=5850.614s">And</a> as I look at this, I think we're at a point where we do have to make bold decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=5859.478s">They're</a> not easy decisions to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=5861.86s">I</a> mean, I know I want a fire station just as much as anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=5865.201s">I</a> think we all do. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=5866.602s">We</a> all want a police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=5867.863s">We</a> all want a fire station. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=5868.803s">We</a> all want new facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=5871.925s">These</a> issues aren't new. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=5874.366s">But</a> I think many times, bold decisions need to be taken, and they need to be made. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=5879.602s">You</a> know, if you take a look at a debt exclusion, you know, that might not be a popular idea, but when you look at it, it's something that's available in the toolkit, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=5888.004s">It's</a> something that, you know, we need to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=5892.686s">We</a> need new state-of-the-art facilities, without a doubt. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=5897.567s">I</a> mean, do we need a new police station? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=5899.587s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=5900.127s">We</a> need a fire station as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=5901.248s">We</a> need all new fire stations, to tell you the truth, because they're all in really bad condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=5906.689s">But</a> we need to start at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=5908.25s">We</a> need to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=5910.95s">And,</a> you know, in my heart, I mean, I believe that, you know, that's something that we need to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=5915.851s">We</a> do need to look at that exclusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=5917.251s">Not</a> a popular answer, I'm sure, but it's something that we need to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=5921.732s">You</a> know, and if it comes up to a vote, when it comes up to a vote and it fails, then we need to find another direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=5928.093s">But</a> I think what we need to continuously do, and I know what I will continuously do, I will continuously advocate for a training tower. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=5935.674s">I</a> will continuously advocate for a new fire station <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=5940.347s">improvements</a> or additional, if we can build, we should really have a long-term plan to replace all of our freight stations. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=5947.071s">That's</a> what's really needed at the end of the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=5949.573s">I</a> mean, we have some very old buildings that have some very serious issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=5955.637s">And</a> I think, you know, long-term planning, long-term capital planning needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=5961.4s">So</a> I just wanted to, you know, just <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=5964.998s">offer</a> my opinion on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=5966.219s">I</a> know it's not an easy one. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=5967.52s">I</a> understand your frustration, Mr. Buckley. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=5971.664s">You're</a> not in an easy position either. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=5973.645s">I</a> completely understand that.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6993.709s">Just</a> because you mentioned the timing, and I understand the bid process does <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7000.375s">take</a> time. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7003.016s">But</a> what's the, do you know as far as like when they, someone's awarded the bid, someone starts the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7009.119s">Do</a> you know, have you done any research as to how long this will take?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7036.772s">But</a> I mean the actual work. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7037.893s">So</a> like when they would actually come in and like, you know.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7130.882s">I</a> didn't hear you say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7133.484s">Councilor</a> Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7134.405s">So</a> if this did come to a vote tonight, and if the vote failed, when does it come up again? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7138.567s">Next</a> week. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7139.268s">90</a> days. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7139.508s">90</a> days?

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7706.09s">I</a> mean, I definitely, as a former member of the school committee, I know that <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7711.977s">Playground</a> is in tough condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7713.438s">The</a> flooring there is apparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7715.959s">I've</a> done it many times, and I know it desperately needs to be replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7719.52s">So</a> I'm glad that you went through this effort to actually get the funding, to request the funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7726.963s">Like</a> I said, with three kids that went through that school, I know that playground takes a beating. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7731.464s">And</a> the ground there is in a tough shape, so this desperately needs to be done.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8361.366s">Councilor</a> Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8362.186s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8363.587s">As</a> I stated earlier, this is a bold decision, but it's a tool in the toolkit that we should take a look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8369.95s">We</a> should take a look at all of our options. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8371.391s">It's</a> a healthy exercise to go through. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8374.043s">So</a> it would be good to actually see the wording from City Solicitor Romley. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8378.886s">But</a> I think one of the most important things is that we do have public meetings and get public input. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8385.65s">And</a> also, educate the public as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8389.172s">So</a> the public fully knows what does this mean to them? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8392.594s">What's</a> the impact on them? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8395.296s">What's</a> it gonna mean to their tax bill? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8398.134s">These</a> are things that we need to look at, but I think in the interest of transparency and open government, we should have public meetings with regard to this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8408.482s">But</a> I think education is key in educating the public as to what the impact is going to be on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8415.308s">So,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8416.629s">Councilor</a> Lungo-Koehn.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=4114.597s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=4115.517s">I</a> reviewed the records. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=4116.477s">They</a> appear to be in order and I move approval.<h2><a href="../2018-02-28_cWHRmg4nTSM/2018-02-28_cWHRmg4nTSM.html">Medford City Council 02/27/18</a></h2>

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=621.651s">Yes</a> I do, Mr. President, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=623.852s">We</a> had a subcommittee on zoning on February 6th, 2018 at 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=629.807s">And</a> the members of this subcommittee are myself, Councilor Knight, and Councilor Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=635.809s">The</a> purpose of the meeting was to review all papers assigned to the subcommittee of zoning and ordinances and to review zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=642.172s">So</a> at the beginning of this term, Mr. President, you decided to split these former zoning and ordinance subcommittee to two separate subcommittees. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=652.195s">One</a> was zoning and one is ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=654.216s">So</a> what we did is we actually just went through the papers that were in committee and we moved <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=660.462s">Papers</a> 16555, 16660, 16705, 17542, 17094, 17321, and 17320 to the subcommittee on ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=662.244s">Papers</a> 16-359, 16-338. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=679.695s">16,</a> 6, 2, 6, and 16, 6, 6, 6 are staying in the zoning subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=685.517s">Uh,</a> we also, I talked about, um, inclusionary housing and mixed use housing and the committee members are going to be doing some research, uh, or have been doing research over the past couple of weeks, uh, to, um, to present, uh, at a meeting, um, next week.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2592.35s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2594.21s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2595.731s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2597.031s">Thank</a> you, Chief Sacco. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2599.212s">I</a> find everything to be very alarming. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2604.734s">As</a> a father of three kids in the Medford Public Schools, I always feel that my kids are safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2611.804s">And</a> now I see something like this today, and I feel they're safe, but I have concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2616.928s">And</a> I think they're very valid concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2619.57s">You</a> know, as far as, you know, when we notify police about an incident like this, do we have a clear policy as to when? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2626.555s">I</a> mean, to me, there should be a clear, you know, I watch the commercials, I hear it on the radio, I see it on TV. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2633.059s">See</a> something, say something. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2634.901s">I</a> tell my kids that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2636.602s">You</a> know, and I think it's a good theory to go by. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2639.464s">Because</a> I think, you know, we need to, <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2641.328s">keep</a> law enforcement active and engaged in what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2644.57s">To</a> me, this is a clear case where see something, say something should have been the appropriate choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2656.478s">Do</a> we have a clear policy that says in this situation, there's some sort of ammunition and I'm no gun expert, but there's some sort of weapon that we contact the police.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2671.841s">Yes,</a> I have.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2719.509s">What</a> I would like to see is I would like to see the school committee work on a clear policy.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2733.603s">But</a> I think the parents as well, because if you're going to notify the school committee, that's going to go out to the general public. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2739.564s">So</a> the general public should hear from our school leader, the superintendent saying, this is a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2744.226s">This</a> is what's been found. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2745.386s">This</a> is what we think is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2748.767s">I</a> mean, getting input from the chief as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2751.448s">I</a> think, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2753.148s">You</a> know, I understand that there are probably certain issues that are minor, that maybe not everyone needs to know about, if there's a fight in the playground or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2760.893s">But</a> something like this, where there's a piece of ammunition that's found, you know, within the school building, that that's a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2768.558s">And</a> that's a concern that many people have here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2770.659s">There's</a> many people that are watching at home that have this concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2773.801s">And</a> I know all of us behind this rail have the same concern.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2888.798s">Mr.</a> Superintendent, I would honestly like to see you, the police chief Sacco, and the <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2894.501s">the</a> mayor and the school committee come together and formulate a policy as to, you know, when, you know, to actually put a policy in place, when should the police be contacted about an issue like this? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2905.748s">Because</a> I think there needs to be a clear definition, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2909.051s">I</a> mean, I'd like to see that.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2912.433s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2913.113s">Now,</a> the Thursday night meeting, which I know I've received a ton of calls about, I believe that's going to be at the high school.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2919.377s">I</a> would respectfully ask that that be held here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2922.199s">I</a> think it's, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2924.264s">from</a> being a former school committee member, having meetings at the high school, the acoustics are really, they're not great. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2930.509s">I</a> think you, my guess is you're gonna have a lot of people at this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2933.852s">I</a> think that it's better situated to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2936.033s">You</a> have microphones, you have, people will be able to actually hear the dialogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2940.577s">This</a> is an important topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2942.258s">It's</a> an important issue that people wanna know about. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2944.6s">They</a> wanna know what happened, when it happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2946.521s">They</a> wanna see a timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2948.163s">I</a> think that if you try to have a meeting like that in a library or the superintendent's conference room, <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2952.694s">I</a> really think that's probably not the best way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2955.576s">I</a> think having it here at Chambers is the best venue to have the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2961.76s">I</a> think it seats more people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2963.301s">And</a> I think, like I said, the acoustics are much better. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2965.383s">I've</a> been to budget meetings up at the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2967.964s">And</a> if you're sitting in the back, you really have no idea what's going on up at the front, just because the acoustics are not great.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3037.564s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3039.886s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3040.966s">With</a> regard to the sweep of the schools, <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3043.456s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3044.076s">With</a> regard to the sweep, uh, regarding the other schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3046.778s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3047.359s">Uh,</a> now you said that will be done in the near future. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3049.44s">Is</a> that going to be done on the weekends? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3051.161s">Uh,</a> just because, I mean, we're asking that they begin tomorrow and they start doing it all. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3058.046s">So</a> we sweeping schools while kids are in the schools.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3168.912s">I've</a> done a little bit of research myself on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3172.214s">And</a> if you go online, there's videos. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3175.397s">I</a> think the City of Waltham has a video on it as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3179.561s">And</a> they do a good job of basically describing what it is and what you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3184.545s">And</a> they walk you through the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3188.53s">From</a> what I can see, it seems like it's a good program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3190.95s">I</a> think it's something that we should really look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3193.411s">If</a> it's something that you support, I really think that we should probably be moving in that direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3201.292s">You're</a> our expert with regards to law enforcement, and I think that- I don't know about expert, but- But I do feel that you really are our expert when it comes to law enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3211.874s">You</a> talk to people in other districts, and I know Superintendent Belson, you do as well, but I think that this is something that <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3218.364s">In</a> my opinion, this is something that the school committee should really consider. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3223.687s">Looking</a> into Alice, I know it doesn't happen overnight, but I think maybe we should look into it and probably by the fall, by the next school year, it's something that we should implement. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3234.833s">So</a> if we could, and I'm not sure if you could possibly add that to your agenda for Thursday night, but I think it's something that should be considered.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3481.612s">Well,</a> I mean, I think it's something that should be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3484.174s">I</a> think the school committee should seriously consider it, at least at the high school level, maybe even the middle school level. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3492.598s">I</a> understand there's concerns at the elementary school. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3495.021s">I</a> get that, but I think, especially if it's something, Chief, that you're a fan of, I would think that it's something that should be considered. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3502.467s">I'd</a> like to see that part of a future school committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3506.711s">I</a> think it's something that they should look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3509.933s">With</a> regard to the McGlynn staff.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3513.676s">Now,</a> I believe you said you may possibly meet with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3517.475s">Is</a> that something that's going to happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3519.376s">I</a> mean, is there a demand there?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3527.263s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3528.203s">Well,</a> I thank you for answering all my questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3532.206s">That's</a> all I have for now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3535.349s">Like</a> I said, I'm a big fan of see something, say something. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3538.771s">I</a> think that should have been the first thing, the first approach that you should have taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3544.316s">I</a> thank you for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3545.837s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8663.95s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8664.971s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8665.451s">So,</a> uh, when, when will people officially know maybe the city clerk where the meeting is going to be? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8672.854s">I</a> strongly feel it should be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8675.305s">in</a> these chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8676.146s">I</a> mean, is it definitely going to be here, or? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8678.487s">Oh,</a> it's up there.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8709.517s">Can</a> we do a reverse, can we do a reverse 9-1-1?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8920.829s">There</a> was a matter earlier tonight, the Committee of the Whole, to review a open meeting law complaint. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8930.858s">And</a> we found that the complaint was not valid.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8941.315s">Yes,</a> and the city solicitor will be writing up a response to the person that made the claim to, I believe, the Attorney General's Office.<h2><a href="../2018-01-30_nMlCJNUIswQ/2018-01-30_nMlCJNUIswQ.html">Medford, MA City Council - Jan. 30, 2018 [Livestream] (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=1860.897s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=1862.198s">Thank</a> you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=1863.659s">I</a> will actually read this so everybody can hear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=1866.721s">Whereas</a> the City of Bedford has long been a municipal leader in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in environmental stewardship, including creating the first municipal climate action plan, erecting the first municipal scale wind turbine in the state, installing solar panels in energy efficient LED lighting, among other initiatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=1887.553s">Whereas</a> the city of Medford is blessed with nearly one-third open space with its 8.6 square miles, including the Mystic Lakes, Mystic River, and Wrights Pond, which provide valuable habitat for wildlife and recreational opportunities for residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=1904.327s">Whereas</a> millions of non-biodegradable plastic bags are used in Medford each year, creating litter, polluting our streets, parks, and waterways, harming wildlife, and potentially causing harm to human infants. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=1916.637s">Whereas</a> plastic bags are difficult to recycle and frequently contaminate material and damage equipment used to process items collected through the city's single stream curbside recycling program. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=1929.68s">Whereas</a> reusable bags are considered to be the best option to reduce waste <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=1935.602s">and</a> litter, protect wildlife and conserve resources, and that many inexpensive and convenient varieties are increasingly available and used by Medford residents and visitors, whereas a number of businesses in the city have already taken affirmative steps to encourage the use of reusable bags by their patrons. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=1956.048s">Whereas</a> 61 cities and towns in the Commonwealth, including neighboring Somerville and Arlington, and nearby Cambridge, Boston, and Melrose have enacted ordinances governing the use of plastic bags in their communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=1968.134s">Be</a> it resolved that the City of Medford, working with the Medford City Council, the Energy and Environment Health and Law Departments, the Energy and Environment Committee, SEEM, Student Environmental Advocates of Medford, <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=1982.2s">the</a> Medford Chamber of Commerce and city merchants and its citizenry create an ordinance that will govern and ultimately phase out the use of plastic bags at all points of sale in the city to decrease damage to our environment, reduce litter and waste removal costs, and improve public health without being detrimental to conducting business in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=2009.515s">Mr.</a> President, if I may. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=2012.037s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=2012.678s">Tonight</a> I offer this resolution because I believe it is an important issue that has a deep and lasting negative impact on our city, its residents, and our environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=2022.367s">There</a> are many reasons why we should ban plastic bags. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=2025.529s">I'll</a> name a few but there are plenty. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=2028.772s">Plastic</a> bags create a major litter problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=2030.974s">Visual</a> blight when they blow into trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=2033.095s">They're</a> the third largest type of litter from land-based sources found on U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=2037.017s">coasts.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=2037.878s">They</a> pollute our oceans, rivers, and landscapes. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=2042.061s">Plastic</a> bags are a hazard to marine life, seabirds, animals. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=2046.952s">Plastic</a> bags do not biodegrade, and although they do fragment through mechanical action and photodegradation in the presence of light, these processes are slow, taking an estimated 200 plus years to complete. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=2061.037s">Polyethylene</a> bags are made from non-renewable fossil fuels. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=2065.218s">The</a> over 100 billion plastic shopping bags used each year in the United States are made up of the estimated equivalent of 439 million gallons of oil. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=2075.338s">Plastic</a> bags clog storm water drains. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=2079.123s">They're</a> consumed in extremely high volumes. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=2081.746s">Consumers,</a> more often than not, do not recycle plastic bags. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=2086.453s">Plastic</a> bags contribute to overburdened landfills. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=2090.778s">While</a> researching this issue, and I mentioned this earlier, plastic bags are banned in over 60 plus cities and towns in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=2098.4s">Plastic</a> bags are banned in over 40 countries. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=2101.46s">It</a> is time that we add our city to the list of the 60 plus cities and towns that have ordinances that ban plastic bags. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=2109.742s">Recently,</a> I was approached by individual residents, organizations, and students <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=2114.185s">with</a> regard to offering a resolution to banning plastic bags in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=2118.447s">At</a> Medford High School, we have a great program called the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=2124.649s">Within</a> the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility, we have seen student environmental advocates of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=2133.012s">This</a> group has been working hard on this issue and other environmental issues along with the Energy and Environment Committee as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=2141.478s">Surveys</a> have shown that plastic carryout bags are used for approximately 12 minutes and then discarded. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=2149.223s">With</a> that being said, we need to evaluate if we as a community value the use of a plastic bag often used for a few minutes more than protecting our environment from the devastating long-lasting effects of plastic bags. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=2166.338s">As</a> a father of three children, it is my hope to leave this community a better place for our children and our grandchildren. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=2172.844s">This</a> is a start. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=2174.526s">Let's</a> use this resolution tonight as a launching pad to develop a city ordinance to ban plastic bags in the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=2181.393s">I</a> thank you for your time and I respectfully ask my colleagues for the consideration <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=2187.992s">And</a> I believe that we should move this to the subcommittee on ordinances, where we can have an ordinance developed and designed. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=2195.574s">And</a> if I may, Mr. President, I'd like to amend this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=2200.616s">And</a> I'd like to amend it until we actually get an ordinance in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=2205.097s">I'd</a> like to see the city set up plastic bag recycling stations in each of our public buildings, City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=2211.399s">the</a> library, we can come up with a list. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=2213.641s">But</a> I think that we should do that to actually at least get the ball rolling until we actually have a formal ordinance in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=2221.786s">At</a> this point in time, I know there are a number of people that would like to speak on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=2226.51s">If</a> I could bring up Rubia, who is from the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=2232.434s">for</a> Medford High School, and she has a number of packets that she'd like to give out as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=2237.316s">She's</a> from the Student Environmental Advocates of Medford.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=3996.399s">Do</a> you want to speak if we so if we made this seems to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=4002.265s">a</a> little discussion, I guess, as to where they should go next. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=4006.806s">And</a> I know for me, one of the big pieces of this resolution in coming up with a final resolution and adopting resolution is to make sure there's involvement from the different groups that are here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=4020.189s">Because</a> a lot of these people here tonight are on the front lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=4023.25s">They</a> have experience in this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=4026.031s">They've</a> researched this already. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=4027.891s">So</a> I want to make sure that they're involved, and that's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=4034.316s">I</a> think at this point the best bet is why don't we <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=4039.216s">move</a> it to Committee of the Whole, get input from, actually no, let's do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=4043.837s">I</a> think the best thing is, let's go to City Solicitor Romley, let's get a draft first of what we think it should be, what he thinks would be a good way to start, I guess, looking at other resolutions, or other ordinances, I guess, from other cities, and then we'll push it to Committee of the Whole to have, I think, probably the Council weigh in, and then, <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=4064.454s">I</a> want to make sure there's plenty of community involvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=4069.896s">There's</a> a lot of groups here, a lot of people here that are interested in something, that are interested in the ordinance, but I want to make sure that we're starting off with something. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=4077.978s">And</a> I think if we all get into a room, we're just throwing thoughts and ideas around, it could get kind of messy. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=4082.199s">So</a> I'm thinking if we start off with getting some sort of a draft resolution, <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=4086.52s">from</a> the city solicitor, and then from that point, we can get together and bring in the groups and the council as well to give input.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=4131.082s">Yes,</a> that would be the that would be the point of bringing it back to community the whole because I want to make sure that each consulate gets to weigh in. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=4138.283s">But</a> I want to make sure that the residents get to weigh in, especially, you know, rubia and the students at Bedford High School that have been working on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=4145.085s">I</a> mean, I believe you've got a number of you had a petition that went out as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=4150.106s">So</a> a lot of people are interested in this and it needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=4153.166s">But</a> I want to make sure there's plenty of community involvement.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=4167.996s">And</a> that's what this is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=4169.157s">There</a> are a lot of people that want to weigh in on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=4171.959s">But</a> I think we need to start somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=4175.721s">So</a> I think if we have a draft. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=4178.484s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=4179.004s">So</a> I mean, I think we have a bunch of people in a room just firing ideas around. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=4182.368s">I</a> think that might get kind of messy. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=4183.63s">So</a> I think if we have some sort of a draft resolution first and then we can make adjustments and changes, that would probably be the best. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=4190.538s">Every</a> ordinance goes through three readings. <a href="https://youtu.be/nMlCJNUIswQ&t=4192.68s">Absolutely.</a>

Burke on Thursday, December 28th, regarding the purchase of a trackless plow for the Department of Public Works to better clear sidewalks during the winter months, we will be purchasing one for $130,545. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5596.94s">The</a> machine is called the Holder, and it is made in Canada. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5600.743s">The</a> local dealer for this machine is in Chelmsford, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5604.125s">The</a> machine will have a snowblower attachment, a power reversible plow blade, and a dump body and a sander unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5610.969s">So</a> happy to say that this issue sounds like it's being addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5615.652s">Mr.</a> President, if you wouldn't mind, if we could get just a further answer with regard to the timing on this, when we should actually see this piece of machinery here in our city and when we could actually see, may possibly see it in service. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5633.733s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5635.115s">Councilor</a> Lungo-Koehn.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6511.468s">some</a> sort of contact or some way to reach out to ways he's done it in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6514.87s">And</a> this is definitely something that I think we should definitely push in his direction, have him look into. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6520.693s">It</a> definitely needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6522.294s">It's</a> amazing what that app has done to our city streets in our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6527.837s">And</a> while we're on the topic, just to mention really quick, tomorrow night at the Lawrence Memorial Hospital School of Nursing is our next <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6536.281s">community</a> police meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6537.322s">I</a> just wanted to bring that up, but I thought it was appropriate to bring it up now, since we are talking about this issue here, and a lot of issues like this here are discussed during that type of meeting.<h2><a href="../2017-12-19_iFIQoDUm-og/2017-12-19_iFIQoDUm-og.html">Medford, MA City Council - Dec. 19, 2017 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

Hassett Drive. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1809.105s">The</a> address is 101, but you can see it's the building is boarded up, but in the lower half of the building towards the basement, there is a board. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1818.49s">The</a> boards have fallen off the building and the windows are broken and the whole bottom half of the building is exposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1825.453s">Anyone</a> can get in there, kids, homeless people, I mean anyone has access to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1829.735s">So</a> it's a bit of a safety concern that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1832.736s">So</a> if we could have the administration reach out to the landlord of that building to have that boarded up immediately, I'd greatly appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1840.838s">And</a> if I could further amend the paper to basically get some sort of an update from the landlord as to <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1848.581s">what</a> they plan to do with the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFIQoDUm-og&t=1849.742s">I</a> believe it's going to be a hotel, or at one point we were told it was going to be a hotel, but maybe get an update on the timetable.<h2><a href="../2017-12-13_qZO7pLjaumo/2017-12-13_qZO7pLjaumo.html">Medford, MA City Council - Dec. 12, 2017 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=751.136s">So</a> I mean, I think it's interesting, and I think it's definitely, I definitely like notifying more people. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=756.478s">I</a> think that's a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=758.339s">I</a> just have, I guess, some concerns that there's like unintended consequences here. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=762.08s">So</a> for like the local person that's trying to make a home improvement, put a deck on the back of their house, and they need a variance. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=769.423s">Maybe</a> they're too close to the property line. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=772.244s">So</a> if they have that type of a situation, that person is going to have to notify <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=780.09s">everyone</a> within that 400 foot?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=809.522s">That's</a> my concern, because I definitely like the idea of making sure that we notify more people. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=814.303s">But</a> I guess I'm worried about once you get into the neighborhoods, if you're doing something to increase the value of your property. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=822.646s">Maybe</a> you're putting on a deck. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=824.106s">You're</a> doing some sort of home improvement, and it's not that major. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=831.702s">You</a> know, there's a concern, I think, that you're adding a cost to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=837.183s">And</a> there's just a little bit of a concern there. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=840.523s">So</a> I think for big developments, this is something that's definitely needed and warranted. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=848.305s">I</a> mean, I think it's definitely something that would benefit the whole neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=852.606s">But</a> for someone that's doing a small type of home improvement, I have some concerns there. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=862.748s">my</a> colleague wouldn't mind if we could amend this maybe just to projects that have to go through site plan review. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=867.852s">And</a> I'm not sure if that makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=869.293s">Maybe</a> you could weigh in on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=870.755s">But</a> I'm just thinking that if we're going to have local, my concern is that if we're going to have local neighbors that want to make an improvement and add cost to that and add more red tape to that, I think that's a little bit of a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=883.185s">So</a> I'm just thinking if maybe we could have this apply to any type of <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=888.329s">project</a> that requires site plan review, maybe that's the direction we should head in. <a href="https://youtu.be/qZO7pLjaumo&t=892.452s">And</a> that's an amendment to the resolution that I would offer if my colleague is willing to accept that.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=3246.935s">No,</a> I think it's a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=3248.316s">So</a> the total project has to be $10,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=3253.059s">Is</a> the total budget for that piece $25,000?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=3321.944s">And</a> as far as in the other cities and towns that you've talked to, that small piece of the budget that was allocated to small projects, is that something that's been successful?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=3333.532s">Good.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=3333.912s">Sounds</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=3334.292s">I</a> like it.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=3936.482s">Councilor</a> Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=3939.004s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=3939.885s">One</a> quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=3940.565s">So</a> as far as those projects go, those urgent projects, what would be an example of an urgent project that would be eligible for this type of funding?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=3970.276s">So</a> like something that was maybe <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=3973.047s">potentially</a> going to be developed, but the city had the option to buy it and prevent development, something like that?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=3980.576s">Okay,</a> thank you very much.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=4146.935s">Councilor</a> Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=4148.035s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=4148.976s">Mr.</a> Kearns, just a couple of quick questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=4150.557s">Can</a> you just tell us a little bit about the water leak, the cause of the water leak, when it happens?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=4391.162s">It</a> sounds like there's two parts to the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=4394.287s">As</a> far as replacing the main, putting in the new hydrant, how long will that take?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=4428.743s">So</a> when they're actually installing the new main, what can the residents expect as far as will they be without water periods during the day, I imagine?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=4458.109s">So</a> I actually took a ride down the street the other day just to kind of check out the situation and view it firsthand. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=4464.713s">And</a> there's markings all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=4467.555s">Actually,</a> at one point, the street looks like it comes up on a mound. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=4471.978s">It</a> looks like something's going on underneath.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=4496.893s">Is</a> there any concern, so when you connect that main on Douglas, that's connecting then to?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=4531.805s">I</a> mean, it sounds like, I mean, it's almost 100 years old, so it sounds like the whole thing probably should be replaced, but thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=4537.908s">Okay,</a> thank you, sir.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=5183.419s">Thank</a> you Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=5185.361s">I</a> want to thank Council colleague for bringing this forward tonight because I think this is an issue that is coming up more and more throughout our community and if I could just amend the resolution to also include Tainter Street, Everett Street and lower Fulton Street as well between <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=5201.937s">Salem</a> Street and Webster Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=5204.638s">That</a> whole area, that whole block, there's a lot of cars down there with out of state plates. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=5211.202s">And</a> it's an issue that really needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=5214.103s">And</a> I believe it's happening in other sections of the city or other neighborhoods of the city as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=5219.606s">But</a> it's a resolution that I certainly support. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=5223.007s">So</a> I second the resolution.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=5338.931s">Mr.</a> President, I have a small edit that I could review with the clerk, but other than that minor edit, everything looks fine and I move that the records be approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGpYlC7_Nvc&t=5351.555s">As</a> amended.<h2><a href="../2017-12-14_hpwDO7TBAHE/2017-12-14_hpwDO7TBAHE.html">Medford, MA City Council - Nov. 28, 2017 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

I think a lot of our <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=1720.292s">departments</a> to stretch with regard to resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=1722.453s">And</a> I would, I really don't, um, like the fact that we're going to put a resource towards building this list if this might not even pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=1730.778s">So,</a> um, I, I, I agree with my colleague, uh, Councilor Knight on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/hpwDO7TBAHE&t=1735.641s">So</a> thank you.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4419.761s">Thank</a> you Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4420.602s">I</a> just want to say good luck and congratulations on your new role. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4424.344s">I</a> had the opportunity, we bumped into each other down in Haines Square on Saturday morning at Modern Hardware and you were talking to George and introducing yourself so it looks like you've hit the ground running. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4436.134s">which</a> is good to see.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4561.41s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4562.791s">This</a> issue is recently, actually, it's gotten better. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4567.913s">They</a> put up a DPW with the assistance, well, it passed the traffic commission, and they put up a do not enter sign from 7 to 9 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4576.376s">in</a> the morning, and that's helped out tremendously with regard to the traffic that flows down Brackett Street onto Andrew Street and all the surrounding streets, and it has significantly lessened the traffic on Fulton Street in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4588.82s">You</a> know, it's impossible to do constant nonstop enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4592.385s">So</a> there are people that do take that, depending on which way you're coming down Elm, they'll take a right or a left to go down Brackett. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4600.016s">So</a> I'm just basically asking that if we could have a no right hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4605.444s">If</a> you come and ask north of Elm, no right-hand turn sign and no left-hand turn sign if you're going south down Elm. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4614.567s">So</a> just to prevent people from going down Brackett Street in the morning between 7 and 9 a.m., so just asking if the DPW could put up those signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4623.351s">And</a> of course, if you could send this before the Traffic Commission first for their approval and their advice as well.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4656.525s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4658.246s">I</a> believe you may have skipped a resolution, though.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4663.066s">OK,</a> perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4663.486s">Sounds</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4665.207s">Yeah,</a> so throughout the last few months, I've received a lot of calls with regard to the police station, the progress that's been made. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4672.031s">And</a> I know the administration has been working hard with the chief of police and the Medford Police Department with ongoing meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4679.676s">with</a> regard to the future of the police station in that project in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4684.277s">So</a> I just think, you know, we've already appropriated some money and I know we're going to be appropriating money in the future to build a police station, that it's fair that we at this point in time ask for an update with regard to the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4696.58s">Any</a> information that we can receive in, you know, timeline as well I think would be beneficial to all of us just because I know that I'm receiving calls, I'm sure many members have been receiving calls about this issue as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4708.762s">So</a> if we could receive some sort of formal communication from the administration, just updating us with regard to this issue, or committee of the whole meeting, if that's the way members would like to go, I think that's fine too. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4720.111s">So,</a> I move approval.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4871.215s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4872.015s">I</a> received a call from a number of residents down on Windsor Road regarding it's a divot. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4876.658s">It</a> looks like it's actually maybe some trench work that was done before in the past and it's sunk over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4882.781s">So</a> if we could just have the DPW go by and just try to fill that in. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4887.083s">to</a> level the surface in the interest of public safety.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4915.022s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4916.083s">I</a> received a number of calls from people in this neighborhood or residents in this neighborhood asking about placing a stop line on the ground next to the stop signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4925.971s">This</a> is a, it seems like with the <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4929.802s">So</a> many people using Waze now, the app that sends people through neighborhoods that, you know, there's increased traffic and there's a lot of kids in this area that traverse back and forth to the Roberts Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4941.95s">And</a> so this is a safety issue that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4944.372s">So</a> if we could have a stop line placed on both ends of that street in the matter of, in the interest of public safety, I'd greatly appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4955.92s">And</a> if we could actually forward this to the Traffic Commission for their approval as well.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5880.642s">Do</a> you know how much it would cost to totally rehabilitate the carriage house?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5904.11s">So</a> I've only been on the council for about two years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5906.751s">And</a> during that time, we talked about the Brooks Estate a little bit here and there, but this is, I think, the first time that something's come before me to appropriate money for the Brooks Estate. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5920.659s">And</a> I would agree with Mr. Warren. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5922.76s">The</a> way I look at this, this is an investment. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5925.522s">If</a> we own it, we should embrace it. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5928.188s">And</a> we own it, and we should be embracing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5931.19s">This</a> is a project that I think that's good. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5933.571s">I</a> think, in my opinion, there's a lot of potential here. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5936.372s">There's</a> a lot of potential. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5938.573s">I've</a> scanned the business plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5939.854s">I</a> think that was the master plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5941.995s">I've</a> seen that before. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5942.875s">And</a> I think that there's a lot of potential with this property. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5948.798s">It's</a> a long-term investment, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5950.099s">But</a> if we own it, we should be investing in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5952.28s">It</a> doesn't do us any good to let it rot away in the woods. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5956.842s">As</a> time goes by, it only becomes more expensive to fix it. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5960.364s">So</a> it's an investment that I think we should be making. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5962.526s">I</a> second the resolution tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5966.328s">And</a> thank you for your time.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=829.418s">Councilor</a> Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=830.299s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=831.419s">I</a> just want to go on record of supporting this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=834.34s">I</a> think it's a good resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=835.921s">Zoning</a> is one of the most important responsibilities that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=839.917s">you</a> know, on the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=841.137s">And</a> it's something that, uh, we need to make sure that we have the opportunity to attend these meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=846.739s">Um,</a> especially when you have major developments, uh, that are going in, uh, people call us, they want answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=852.581s">And,</a> uh, so we should, uh, you know, have the opportunity to attend those meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=856.363s">And</a> if the meetings occur at the same time, then something has to give. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=859.744s">So</a> I think that, uh, then moving, uh, the zoning, uh, board moving those meetings to another night, I think would be ideal for everyone, uh, in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=870.393s">But</a> I also believe that, and I mentioned this before in the past, they shouldn't be held in the room across the hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=877.017s">Zoning</a> board meetings should be held here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=879.418s">If</a> you go to a zoning board meeting, it's ridiculous that people have to stand in the hallway to find out what's going on, especially if it's a big issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=887.983s">They</a> can't even hear the presentation that's being put on by the developer. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=892.105s">You</a> could be in support or non-support, but you still can't hear the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=897.909s">And</a> that doesn't do, <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=899.472s">That</a> doesn't benefit anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=901.133s">So</a> really, in my opinion, they shouldn't be held in that room. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=904.935s">They</a> should be on a night other than Tuesday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=907.317s">And</a> I'm hoping that when we have the legislative software that's going to be installed hopefully soon, we'll have those meetings on tape, and people will be able to watch them 24-7. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=919.845s">And</a> a lot of the documents will be accessible 24-7 as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=925.348s">So</a> I support the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=926.429s">I</a> second the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=928.51s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=1392.895s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=1394.136s">I</a> had mentioned earlier that I believe that the Zoning Board of Appeals meeting should be held in Alden Chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=1400.56s">It</a> should be held in City Council Chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=1402.942s">I'd</a> like to have a resolution that the Zoning Board of Appeals meetings be held in Alden Chambers.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6304.749s">Councilor</a> Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6306.61s">If,</a> if, if I may just really quick, it is the first Wednesday of the month tomorrow, November 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6311.971s">Uh,</a> that means it's time for the monthly community police meeting at the Roberts elementary school. <a href="https://youtu.be/hcZI56w1erc&t=6318.445s">Everyone</a> is welcome, no matter what neighborhood you're from, 7 p.m., Roberts Elementary School, monthly Method police meeting.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3351.693s">Hello,</a> hello. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3353.214s">My</a> name is John Falco, and I'm a candidate for re-election to the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3357.216s">I</a> am currently in my first term. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3359.697s">I'd</a> like to begin by thanking the Medford Ward 6 Committee for hosting this event tonight, and I'd also like to thank each of you for being here tonight as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3367.661s">My</a> wife Jackie and I reside at 123 Fulton Spring Road with our three sons, John, Joey, and Jack. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3374.544s">All</a> three of my sons attend the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3377.993s">I'm</a> currently an assistant vice president at an investment management firm in Boston and have over 25 years of finance experience in both public and private global organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3389.077s">The</a> city of Medford provides a welcoming home to people from all over the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3393.338s">I'm</a> proud to live in a city that embraces diversity and inclusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3398.48s">As</a> a first term city councilor, I have advocated for issues that I believe benefit all of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3404.794s">I</a> believe in a transparent government that supports the men, women, and organizations that are the backbone of our community, our schools, our police, and our fire departments, arts and cultural organizations, and citizen-led groups in an effort to increase transparency and community involvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3421.808s">I</a> led the effort to purchase legislative software which will increase transparency by providing 24-7 on-demand access to all public meetings and documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3432.492s">As</a> a parent, I know firsthand the value of small class size, improved technology, special education services, infrastructure improvements, and new program offerings, which is why I continue to advocate for additional funding to support the educational needs of our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3450.778s">My</a> commitment to public safety is unwavering. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3453.359s">I</a> implemented neighborhood community police meetings to cultivate engagement between the residents and our police officers in the interest of building stronger neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3463.262s">I</a> have also supported a new police station in turnout gear for our firefighters, and will continue to advocate for additional resources, equipment, and staff to protect our police and fire departments and Public Works employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3476.427s">As</a> we all know, traffic throughout our city is a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3479.743s">that</a> continues to have a negative impact on the quality of life for all residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3484.207s">The</a> first resolution I offered was that the city hire a traffic engineer to study this significant problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3490.053s">Week</a> after week, I staunchly advocated for this position because I believe it will aid in improving public safety and the quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3499.045s">Through</a> this hard work and determination, a traffic engineer was finally included in this year's budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3504.327s">I</a> supported lowering the speed limit to 25 miles per hour in the interest of public safety, but I know there's more work that we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3511.64s">My</a> resolution to hire an outside consulting firm to conduct a zoning needs analysis began the dialogue among my colleagues about this real critical issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3520.902s">Our</a> zoning has not been reviewed in 50 years, and a complete assessment is needed to guide future smart and responsible development. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3529.784s">I</a> have been and will continue to be proactive in protecting our neighborhoods from oversized irresponsible development, whether it be in North Method, South Method, Wellington, West, Hillside, <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3542.525s">I</a> also supported extending the demolition delay on historic properties from 6 to 18 months because I am committed to protecting the integrity of our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3552.834s">I</a> continue to advocate for more resources in our Office of Community Development to support current and future business owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3559.84s">I</a> am committed to making these areas more welcoming with improved lighting, safer and cleaner streets, and a beautification program that includes public art. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3570.463s">With</a> its access to Mystic River and new management of the Chevalier Theatre, now is the time to revitalize Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3577.305s">I</a> will continue to advocate for the creation of walking paths from Hormel Stadium to Medford Square as part of this revitalization. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3585.507s">Medford</a> is changing, but it's important to remember that we need to maintain what we already have. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3590.509s">I</a> believe it is critical that we maintain our schools, city buildings, <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3594.897s">in</a> parks. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3595.537s">We</a> need to repair and pave our streets and sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3598.398s">We</a> need to maintain all of our investments, old and new, for current and future generations of Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3605.4s">We</a> also need to think about environmental sustainability for the next wave of Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3611.182s">I</a> was the only city councilor to support municipal aggregation, and I'll support it when it comes up again. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3616.243s">And</a> I also supported charter review. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3619.584s">Medford</a> continues to be a great place to live, work, play, and raise a family. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3625.223s">With</a> its rich past and promising future, we are a city on the rise with a great deal of opportunity and potential. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=3632.694s">Over</a> the next two years, I look forward to working with you and advocating for you to move Medford forward. <a

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cCMLP2REW0g&t=499.866s">And</a> as far as, um, you know, as far as I'm just thinking, as far as the future goes and from a budgeting perspective, do you know what the life expectancy is for one of these cameras, especially if they're outside? <a href="https://youtu.be/cCMLP2REW0g&t=508.831s">I</a> mean, I'm just, you know, is this something that you have to purchase on a pretty regular basis?

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cCMLP2REW0g&t=5009.381s">When</a> I left early this morning, it was still there. <a href="https://youtu.be/cCMLP2REW0g&t=5011.703s">So,</a> uh, I'm glad they took care of it right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/cCMLP2REW0g&t=5013.825s">They</a> knew this was coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/cCMLP2REW0g&t=5015.046s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cCMLP2REW0g&t=5015.846s">I'm</a> glad to hear what was done.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cCMLP2REW0g&t=5513.254s">A</a> lot of the sidewalks look like they might just need a skim coat, but I mean, just because a few, they just kind of, the top's gone, but there's other, there's other sidewalks that are just completely gone.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cCMLP2REW0g&t=5911.322s">I</a> reviewed the records. <a href="https://youtu.be/cCMLP2REW0g&t=5912.363s">They</a> appear to be in order and I move approval.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cCMLP2REW0g&t=5963.65s">So</a> if we could have the City Clerk make that correction.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6060.688s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6061.909s">I</a> had the opportunity this weekend to go along with a lot of my colleagues to go to the Mystic River Celebration. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6069.19s">And</a> while I was there, I was going to some of the different tables and, you know, just, you know, getting more information, talking to people and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6076.692s">And</a> they went to the Method Farmers Market table and just asked them because I think this is their first year in the new locations down at the Condon Shell. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6083.814s">And</a> they said so far it's been really, really good. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6085.834s">They've</a> had a lot of great activity, a lot of people walking down on Thursday afternoons to <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6090.155s">just</a> buy some local produce and whatnot, and just ask them a little bit about the new location. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6096.399s">And</a> they said it's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6098.1s">They</a> said the challenge now is it's towards the end of the season, so the sun goes down a little bit sooner, and the market goes until 7 PM. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6106.324s">So</a> that last hour, it's getting dark, basically. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6111.387s">And</a> so it's tough for people to walk around, and it's also tough for the vendors to clean up after the market closes down. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6119.992s">So,</a> you know, in the matter of public in the, you know, matter of public safety, it'd be nice if we could have the mayor's office of the electric department, see what they can do to have the lights activated for at least the last hour of the farmers market on Thursday afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6134.584s">So</a> it would probably be, it'd be nice if they could activate them from probably anytime after five to at least <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6139.988s">I'm</a> guessing maybe 7.30 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6142.329s">So</a> it's safe down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6144.309s">It</a> should be well lit. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6145.93s">And</a> it's a great venue to have really any type of local city function. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6153.952s">So</a> it's in the matter of public safety, if we could afford that to the mayor's office of the electrical department, I'd greatly appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6159.774s">Second.</a> <h2><a href="../2017-09-20_CtRL2YQa7iI/2017-09-20_CtRL2YQa7iI.html">Medford, MA City Council - Sep. 19, 2017 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1149.664s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1153.206s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1160.74s">I</a> have a few questions about just the project in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1165.884s">So</a> if you could just let us know and let people watching at home know, how long do you think this project is going to take?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1203.43s">And</a> do you think some of this work will be done at night, or is it mostly to working hours?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1225.56s">And</a> could you tell us, let's see, basically with regard to the sidewalks, you're going to be, I think, ripping up a few sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1236.648s">You're</a> going to be, can you tell us a little bit about, you know, how many sidewalks you're going to rip up? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1242.091s">You're</a> going to be replacing them with cements? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1244.553s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1244.993s">And</a> can you tell us, is it two sidewalks, or do you know how many?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1267.508s">And</a> they'll be replaced with concrete?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1270.585s">And</a> can you tell us with regard to Ashland Street, what would be the impact on the neighborhood with regard to people being able to access their driveways? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1280.554s">Are</a> they going to be having problems accessing their driveways?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1304.427s">And</a> with regard to, you know, we've had a lot of talk during these hearings with regard to paving and how you're going to pave the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1316.898s">needs</a> to be paid once you're done opening up the street and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1321.299s">And</a> this has been a point of contention with anyone that opens up the street is, over time, a lot of these holes, they sink and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1330.061s">And</a> I noticed that you're going to be making a payment to the city in lieu of the final payment. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1336.662s">So</a> is that payment going to be <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1341.069s">reimbursement</a> from curb to curb paving or is that going to be just a reimbursement for the sections that you cut open?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1378.005s">So</a> I guess regardless of who's doing the paving, it looks like you're going to be reimbursing for the paving. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1384.11s">So</a> I guess my question is basically, <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1387.702s">are</a> you going to be reimbursing for curb to curb? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1390.464s">It</a> sounds like enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1391.244s">It</a> sounds like it's going to be maybe just for the sections that you are going to be opening up.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1418.282s">I</a> think that might be a little bit of a point of contention. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1422.005s">I</a> mean, just because I know that we have other utilities have been opening up roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1428.049s">The</a> last meeting we had, we had a number of utilities that came before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1432.172s">And</a> they basically promised that they would pave curb to curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1437.817s">And</a> I feel like we're almost setting precedent by doing this now. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1442.2s">And</a> in some ways, I feel like almost all utilities that come <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1450.359s">My</a> colleagues may have a further comment on that, but I just think that we need to. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1456.339s">make</a> sure that the street is repaired. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1457.88s">And</a> I may like to see curb-to-curb repaving. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1461.061s">I</a> think it's a necessity just because we have so many, you know, I look at Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1466.943s">I</a> mean, I think this is a good project, without a doubt. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1469.544s">But</a> I look at Salem Street, and that is a heavily traversed street on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1474.325s">And</a> I can easily see, you know, if you're just going to be repairing patches, or even half the road, I could definitely see that being torn up over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1483.008s">Um,</a> it's a big cut through the street methods. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1485.129s">Big</a> cut through community. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=1487.611s">And,</a> um, sorry, I think curb to curb paving would be something that we should look at.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4130.175s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4131.535s">And</a> thank you for this report, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4134.237s">Hunt</a> and Superintendent Bellison. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4136.998s">I</a> think this is a great opportunity, and I think it's a great program. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4139.7s">And</a> I'm glad to see that we're getting grant funding for this here type of project. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4144.282s">Can</a> you talk a little bit about the impact on the schools with regards to when this project will take place and how the students will be impacted?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4219.472s">If</a> I may, what would be the duration of the project? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4222.192s">How</a> long would it take to replace all the lights?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4258.163s">Mr.</a> Superintendent, so it sounds like there could be some workers in the building while the students are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4265.285s">Will</a> all the workers be quarried and whatnot?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4286.472s">make</a> sure that we're doing everything we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4289.497s">This</a> is a pretty big project. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4292.16s">There'll</a> be a lot of people in the building, so we just want to make sure we're protecting our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4295.645s">So,</a> thank you.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8496.519s">I'm</a> just thinking if you come around that side of the building, it probably might get a little bit quieter. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8501.362s">But,</a> um, so thank you for answering that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8504.403s">With</a> regard to the compactor, um, I believe the compactor has some sort of, uh, I think when you hit the button, it starts to compact. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8513.128s">And</a> is that pretty loud? <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8514.389s">Or</a> I used to work in a store when I was back in college. <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8517.451s">I</a> knew that seemed to be pretty loud, but I don't know.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8560.37s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=8560.51s">And</a> as far as, actually, you already answered the question.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=666.609s">Do</a> you know when it's going to begin?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=674.997s">And</a> do you know how many sidewalk panels are impacted, just for the residents in the neighborhood to have some sort of idea as to?

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=1248.157s">And</a> as far as the, so would the work hours be just your normal 9 to 5?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=1262.122s">And</a> as far as the impact to the neighbors that live in that neighborhood, are we talking about they're not going to have access to their driveways? <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=1269.666s">What</a> will be the impact and how will they be notified?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=1291.217s">So</a> will you be, you know, sending a notice to the neighbors? <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=1294.679s">I</a> mean, just to let them know the driveway could possibly be not accessible, you know, during these dates?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=1303.844s">I</a> mean, I would think, you know, just I think it's a good idea just to let them know, you know, that this project's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=1310.49s">And,</a> you know, just so they're informed. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=1312.172s">I</a> mean, because I think the worst thing is, is when there's no communication, that's when the phones start ringing. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=1318.137s">That,</a> you know, I knew nothing about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=1320.179s">You</a> know, the person that might live in the street might not know nothing about or anything about this project or they might have minimal information. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=1327.626s">then</a> all of a sudden they can't get into the driveway, and they're calling us for answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=1330.987s">So</a> I think reaching out to the community, to those streets that are impacted and those neighbors that are impacted, it's definitely something that I would recommend.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=1359.222s">Great,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=1359.783s">And</a> as far as the, do you foresee any road closures at all?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=1372.135s">I'm</a> just concerned because I think if I'm reading this map correctly, this leads out to Broadway, right?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=1378.807s">So</a> I'm just concerned that if you're closing a road in Somerville and <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=1384.763s">The</a> residents in Medford don't know anything about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=1387.306s">There's</a> a disconnect there, so if there are any road closures, you know, I would think that, you know, if we could just make sure that the residents know, just because the worst thing is when something insurmountable is impacting them and they don't know anything about it, you know, that's something that we should keep into, you know, take into account.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=1423.267s">Okay,</a> thank you very much.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=2712.495s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=2712.956s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=2714.358s">Similar</a> to a lot of the questions I asked previously regarding the previous project, when will the work take place, and how long will this project last?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=2777.497s">And</a> it's on High Street, right?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=2779.379s">So</a> I assume the road's going to be open, but I would imagine it's going to be quite tough to pass at times, I would think.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=2855.317s">Mr.</a> President, so with that additional 180 feet, I mean, so how long that work would take if you have to
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=2881.527s">Yeah,</a> the library exits from there, and there's a couple of streets that are up in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=2887.413s">So,</a> I mean, those neighbors, those residents will be impacted, it sounds like, if there
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=3569.218s">Councilor</a> Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=3570.14s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=3570.901s">If</a> you could just tell us a little bit about the project, how long it's going to take, the hours you're going to be working, how many sidewalk panels you're going to be pulling out.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=3605.607s">Will</a> they be replaced with concrete? <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=3607.308s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=3607.768s">Even</a> the ones that are temporarily been replaced with asphalt?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=3628.875s">And</a> this is sidewalk work, so you don't anticipate any road closures?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=3665.086s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=3665.567s">And</a> that's key that you actually have included your cell phone number because it's always good that we have a point of contact and that the residents have a point of contact, especially <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=3675.913s">No,</a> like you said, to supply a YouTube video, which I don't think you hear that too often, but it's always nice that the residents can actually see what's going on or, you know, get more information as to what's going on in front of their homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=3685.517s">So,</a> thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=3687.037s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=5972.053s">Councilor</a> Falco has a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=5976.35s">Is</a> that the actual section that has the message piece?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=5994.513s">That's</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=5995.774s">I'm</a> just trying to look at the sketch here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=5997.634s">Is</a> that three feet? <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=6004.185s">It</a> says you have one here and then four.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=6009.801s">This</a> here, is that?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=6019.006s">So</a> it's about two feet of messaging?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=6022.208s">It</a> looks like that's a foot there, so two, three, four, that's three feet of messaging.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=6029.752s">Okay,</a> so that takes you a foot out. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=6031.373s">Yeah,</a> that's the pedestal. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=6033.174s">So</a> one to four.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=6041.414s">Oh,</a> okay, so that's two feet, okay, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=6043.175s">I</a> thought there was a line there, I'm sorry, that's my mistake.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=6046.679s">So</a> two feet, so it'll become almost like a mini movie screen almost?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=6051.683s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=6052.083s">No,</a> because if you, that's actually, that's graphics. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=6056.387s">It's</a> four. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=6056.868s">Oh</a> yeah, yeah.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10132.025s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10132.685s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10133.086s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10134.927s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10136.208s">And</a> I mean, I too, I mean, I feel that the budget, I mean, what we do in passing the budget, reviewing the budget is one of our biggest responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10145.356s">And</a> transparency is key when it comes to the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10148.138s">I</a> mean, everyone should be <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10150.68s">have</a> access to the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10151.841s">I've</a> always felt that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10153.722s">I</a> think especially when you think about it, there's so much money, and everything that runs, runs through the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10160.604s">And,</a> you know, we should be encouraging people to get involved with the budget process and actually taking a look at the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10165.707s">And,</a> you know, one of the biggest, to me, a big initiative that we passed this year, and everyone's still behind, was the legislative software. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10174.57s">It</a> was a motion that I brought forward in the spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10178.052s">And</a> this council stood before it, and it's in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10180.634s">And</a> that is actually to make sure that the materials that we receive <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10186.081s">With</a> legislative software, all those materials should be in that software package. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10190.944s">So,</a> everything we get, you'll be able to see in the general public. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10194.687s">It's</a> all public information, but it's going to be easily accessible with legislative software. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10200.67s">We</a> have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10201.251s">That's</a> passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10201.791s">That's</a> in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10203.932s">It</a> hasn't gone live yet, but to me, in my opinion, I mean, the draft budget, at least, should be part. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10210.416s">It</a> should be actually online for people to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10213.468s">So,</a> if they come to the meeting, they can be, you know, they can look at it in advance and say, okay, this is how much we're spending here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10219.573s">They</a> can ask good questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10220.954s">They</a> can be prepared at meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10222.875s">And</a> it also, you know, it helps us prepare ourselves, too, when all this stuff is at our fingertips. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10227.038s">So,</a> you know, I do, I've always been a big fan of making sure that, you know, the budget, it's transparent, people can see it, and people can access it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10234.664s">So,</a> I just wanted to go and just give my thoughts on this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/-8Uy-JvGvpg&t=10240.268s">So,</a> thank you.<h2><a href="../2017-10-07_fRTeqEogCEI/2017-10-07_fRTeqEogCEI.html">Medford, MA City Council - July 18, 2017 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=6449.282s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=6450.663s">Councilor</a> Belco. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=6451.324s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=6452.264s">I</a> want to thank you for your presentation and thank you for your interest in opening up a business here. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=6458.295s">So</a> you mentioned earlier that you could possibly have 50 dogs at once. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=6463.762s">But</a> you did say, well, maybe 20 or 30 out at one time. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=6466.605s">If</a> you had a maximum capacity of 50 dogs at one time, could you possibly have 50 dogs out in that area at one point in time, at the same time?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=6544.779s">And</a> I apologize, I was trying to read this at the same time as you're presenting. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=6549.242s">So</a> as far as the, what is the inside of that building? <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=6552.784s">How</a> many rooms are we talking as far as, do you have any insight?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=6652.233s">Okay,</a> thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=6653.114s">As</a> far as, so I've received a few calls from neighbors saying the space here is industrial space, or it used to be industrial space. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=6661.301s">It's</a> an industrial zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=6662.802s">Can</a> you talk a little bit about, because I had a couple people call me about safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=6668.087s">Since</a> it was at one time industrial, is it safe for dogs? <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=6671.83s">Can</a> you maybe talk a little bit more about the turf as well? <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=6675.713s">Do</a> you want to take that, sir?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=6777.546s">As</a> far as the turf goes, I think of repetitive use if you have 20, 30 dogs here a day that are outside and peeing and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=6790.62s">What's</a> the life expectancy of the turf? <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=6792.101s">How</a> long is that going to last?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=6795.404s">Absolutely.</a> 
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=6834.075s">I'm</a> just thinking with that many dogs over time, there's definitely a concern about odor. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=6838.638s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=6839.099s">That's</a> in the neighborhood, so that's.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=6916.724s">As</a> far as the how is it how high is the fence eight feet Yes, there is currently an eight-foot fence there and we were actually going to erect an additional eight-foot fence So we will have two eight-foot fences there to all the way around all the way around it as far as <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=6938.393s">I</a> think of 20, 30 dogs, I'm thinking a lot of waste. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=6942.536s">And</a> I'm thinking of odor, I'm thinking the residents, that could be a major problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=6948.139s">But</a> you're only removing waste once a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=6954.92s">That</a> sounds like that could be an issue.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=13688.46s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=13689.501s">I</a> want to thank everybody for coming down. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=13692.022s">No</a> matter what side you are on tonight, it's always good to see civic participation and people coming just to, you know, let us know how you feel, for or against. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=13700.325s">And</a> this is a rather, it's a very interesting issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=13705.207s">And</a> it's one that, you know, I feel, I felt torn about. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=13708.288s">I</a> mean, it's, I'm a dog owner. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=13710.489s">I</a> own a beagle hound. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=13712.33s">I</a> love him. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=13712.73s">He's</a> part of the family. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=13715.951s">My</a> kids love him, and he's a great dog. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=13718.732s">And</a> I love the passion that you bring to this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=13725.155s">Your</a> maps, your sketches, I mean, you've obviously done your research. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=13732.018s">And</a> you can tell you're passionate about this, and that's very impressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=13737.04s">And</a> I come back to also saying, this is a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=13744.289s">This</a> is, it's an idea I think that, yes, Medford could use, but I'm torn on the location. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=13751.153s">I</a> really am, because I do see that, you know, although it's an industrial zone, you have apartment buildings there, you have homes, and that's the part that really, really, I struggle with, because I know, <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=13767.942s">For</a> example, I know this year we've had neighborhood meetings, police meetings in each of the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=13773.667s">And</a> as we've gone through neighborhood to neighborhood, people really care about their neighborhood and really care what happens in their neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=13781.394s">And</a> I have received phone calls and emails on this as well, both for and against. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=13790.257s">You</a> know, so I really do struggle with this decision, but at the end, you know, for me it comes down to the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=13797.82s">And</a> it comes down to, you know, is this going to have a positive or negative impact on, you know, I don't want to say the quality of life, but it does to some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=13806.884s">I</a> mean, because if you're hearing <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=13808.845s">barking</a> all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=13809.626s">I</a> know my dog, I mean, he's part hound. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=13812.067s">When</a> he starts going, he's barking and it can definitely be disruptive. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=13820.553s">When</a> I hear 50 dogs, at the end of the day, 50 dogs is 50 dogs. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=13824.776s">And</a> if they're kind of all going at the same time, that's going to be loud, inside or outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=13834.601s">You</a> know, I love that you're passionate about this, but I think it's a great idea, I just think it's a bad location, and that's what it comes down to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=13845.315s">And</a> I do love the idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=13848.216s">I</a> wish it was a place where there was just no apartment buildings and there were no homes that were near this. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=13857.181s">Because</a> I do think it's a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=13858.681s">And</a> I think it's something that the city could use. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=13860.983s">And</a> I honestly do struggle with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=13863.344s">I</a> know I've talked to you both about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=13867.549s">But</a> at the end of the day, to me it's the neighborhoods and to have this, even though it's an industrial neighborhood, in many ways, because there are apartment buildings there and there are homes there, in many ways it's kind of like a residential neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=13881.613s">And</a> getting back to the other argument of zoning, zoning needs to be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=13886.495s">We've</a> talked about this many times. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=13888.235s">Zoning</a> has not been looked at in this city in 50 years and it needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=13893.197s">So</a> I cannot support this.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=15073.567s">So</a> when would that begin? <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=15075.609s">As</a> far as the hydraulic model, when could we expect some sort of report back that says these are the pain points, these neighborhoods or these streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=15086.499s">You</a> go up into the heights and you hear complaints all the time with regard to pressure and people not being able to take a shower or flush the toilet without losing water somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=15098.17s">It</a> would be nice to see some sort of a report that we could get that, you know, we could just be able to identify and then, you know, I would assume when you get that report back, you come up with some sort of a plan moving forward, right?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=17247.142s">Mr.</a> President, yes, I was able to read them and I have actually a couple of amendments to make to the records.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=17259.345s">Actually,</a> I can just read them out now. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=17262.647s">So</a> there's just two points that were missing, and it had to do with 17-512, which was the city budget, and so if we could just add that Councilor Scarpelli disclosed that he has a relative employed by the schools, and that is reflected in the school budget, and then myself, Councilor Falco, disclosed that he had a relative employed by the city, and that is reflected in the city budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=17288.402s">Motion</a> to approve is amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTeqEogCEI&t=17291.363s">These</a> are the amendments.<h2><a href="../2017-06-28_zSHhVpiqwJA/2017-06-28_zSHhVpiqwJA.html">Medford, MA City Council - June 27, 2017 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=2061.963s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=2062.883s">Alicia,</a> could I, just a quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=2065.024s">So</a> if those funds are not transferred, do the funds then go into free cash?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=2076.297s">Yes,</a> okay It could you and I couldn't hear you before you were talking about it council and I'd asked you about it that you had mentioned something about the tax recap and I missed that so if you could please repeat that again just so through the chair all of us and everyone at home watching absolutely to Councilor Falco the deficit has to be covered if it's not covered through a transfer Then I have to raise it on the tax recap as part of the tax rate.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=2454.124s">Councilor</a> Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=2455.365s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=2457.647s">I</a> received a number of calls as well from residents and from members of the business community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=2462.95s">And</a> I think the important thing is if we're going to do it, let's do it right. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=2466.372s">And</a> I think that I would agree that it should go to Committee of the Whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=2469.394s">We</a> should talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=2470.96s">We</a> should make sure that we're seeking a wide audience. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=2473.021s">Let's</a> really get the input. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=2474.541s">Make</a> sure everyone has an opportunity to weigh in. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=2477.882s">Make</a> sure we're doing the right thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=2479.442s">But</a> bottom line is, if we're going to do it, let's make sure we do it right. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=2482.683s">So</a> I would support the resolution as well, that it goes to committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=2486.204s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=2487.685s">Vice</a> President Mox.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5181.631s">I</a> will yield to the resident.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5402.568s">I</a> can wait if the... If you prefer. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5405.169s">Absolutely,</a> please.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5407.669s">Take</a> your time.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5819.486s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5821.146s">And</a> I'd like to thank all the residents for coming up here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5824.708s">But</a> as we all know, the budget process is a long process. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5828.29s">It's</a> one of our most important responsibilities that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5831.511s">And</a> I'd like to thank <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5833.736s">And</a> I'd like to begin. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5835.017s">This</a> is actually my, I guess, probably closing speech in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5838.24s">But</a> I'd like to begin by thanking the mayor and the department heads for all their hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5843.444s">I</a> know this is not easy as far as going through the budget process. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5846.847s">It</a> takes a lot of time, a lot of effort, a lot of energy, a lot of collaboration. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5851.25s">And</a> I really appreciate that during our budget hearings, and they've been going on for a number of weeks, the quick turnaround, which helps us try to analyze the data. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5860.258s">It</a> helps us try to make a decision in a timely fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5862.46s">So</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5863.34s">to</a> all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5864.501s">I'd</a> like to thank the superintendent of schools and the school committee and all the department heads in the school department for all of their hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5875.406s">Whenever</a> we had questions, those questions were answered the same way in a timely fashion, and I appreciate that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5882.209s">Like</a> I said, it's not easy crafting a budget and presenting this budget, but there are also a lot of people to thank. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5889.653s">My</a> fellow council members here tonight, <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5892.425s">Asked</a> great questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5894.167s">The</a> deliberation process, I thought, was pretty smooth and, for the most part, professional. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5898.771s">And</a> I'd like to thank them for their hard work and dedication. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5902.794s">And</a> most of all, the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5904.176s">The</a> residents that came to the budget meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5907.359s">They</a> asked good questions, made points, and their input was very beneficial. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5914.545s">But</a> although no budget is perfect, I believe that this is a good budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5918.39s">I</a> believe this is a good, solid budget that protects core services, it provides educational and recreation opportunities to our youngest residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5928.135s">A</a> recreation department, which I believe this city has been asking for for years, and it was supported by us on the council, I am very excited to see that in the budget, and that's going to happen, and I can't wait to see the opportunities that that will present to our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5944.683s">I</a> take a look at things that, personally, that I have lobbied for, <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5948.429s">over</a> the past two years, a traffic engineer, something that I have advocated for continuously. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5954.511s">And</a> thank you to my colleagues, you've supported that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5957.352s">And</a> that's something that is in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5959.932s">Take</a> a look at legislative software, something that I've advocated as well over the past year, and something that I believe will increase the transparency that we have here at City Hall, with us and the council, with boards and commissions hopefully. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5973.236s">This</a> is something that I think improves government, it makes it more transparent, <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5977.374s">everyone</a> becomes part of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5978.975s">And</a> happy to say that that's part of the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5981.117s">So</a> these are things that I've been advocating for, but you have been supporting as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5985.541s">And</a> those are part of this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5987.362s">So</a> I think that's something that is good. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5989.764s">I</a> take a look at other parts of the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5991.346s">I</a> see library funding increased, another plus. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=5995.149s">I</a> take a look at the additional positions in the Medford Police Department with the crime scene analyst. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=6000.473s">That's</a> another great addition. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=6002.395s">I</a> take a look at the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=6005.914s">I</a> mean, as a former member of the school committee and a parent that has kids in the Medford public schools, I take a look at this budget and I think this is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=6013.299s">I</a> mean, when I was on the school committee and I came on during the recession, I saw things cut because we couldn't afford those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=6020.724s">Those</a> things are all coming back now. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=6022.625s">I</a> take a look at <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=6024.088s">you</a> know, paraprofessionals or librarians coming back into the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=6029.13s">That's</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=6030.23s">And</a> these are good things that are being added back in. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=6032.872s">I</a> take a look at the increase in maintenance and repair by $200,000, $20,000 for each school. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=6040.455s">Another</a> great addition. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=6042.355s">Low</a> class size. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=6043.276s">I</a> can't say enough about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=6044.556s">As</a> a former member of the school committee, low class size. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=6047.277s">I</a> take a look at this list. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=6049.398s">In</a> some of our schools, 19, 18, 15, <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=6055.018s">17,</a> you can't get lower than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=6057.679s">If</a> you go across the state, you'd be hard pressed to find.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=6065.282s">Let's</a> be professional about it, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=6067.263s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=6071.665s">I</a> said, let's be professional about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=6074.546s">It's</a> distracting. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=6077.447s">So</a> class size is some of the best in the state and we should be proud of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=6081.666s">That</a> is something that the school committee throughout the years has always focused on. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=6086.688s">They</a> should be proud of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=6087.668s">Class</a> size has come down. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=6089.449s">I</a> mean, to have a class with 15 students, that's amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=6092.43s">It's</a> a dream to a teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=6093.491s">So</a> that is another great budget addition. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=6097.952s">Activity</a> accounts in our schools increasing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=6101.033s">That's</a> fabulous. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=6101.754s">I</a> mean, you're getting students involved in what's going on in the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=6106.022s">And</a> you take a look at our vocational school program, from 11 programs, I believe, to 20. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=6111.223s">That's</a> fabulous. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=6112.363s">And</a> this is all part of this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=6114.164s">So</a> this is something that I look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=6118.344s">I</a> support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=6119.344s">I</a> think it's a good budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=6120.605s">We're</a> replacing textbooks in addition. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=6123.925s">We're</a> adding technology with the Chromebooks throughout our school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=6128.606s">These</a> are all good additions to the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=6132.347s">Like</a> I said, not all budgets are perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=6135.042s">but</a> this is something I think, I think this is a good budget, and I think this is something that we can be proud of. <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=6139.423s">So</a> I'd like to second the motion.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=4346.586s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=4346.906s">I</a> mean, it's a major concern and it does impact all neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=4350.029s">So</a> it's something that we need to look at sooner than later.<h2><a href="../2017-06-21_7XGMs-cDtEA/2017-06-21_7XGMs-cDtEA.html">Medford, MA City Council - June 13, 2017 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=799.234s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=801.971s">had</a> the opportunity last week to attend the monthly community police meeting down at the Medford Police Station. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=807.933s">And</a> once again, they had a nice crowd, probably about 25, 30 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=812.355s">And</a> there was about 10 people from Fern Road that attended. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=817.217s">And</a> they had major issues on that road with regard to traffic and speeding. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=823.639s">And</a> at the end of Fern Road is the intersection of Fulton Spring Road and Vista Ave and the other side of Fern Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=830.022s">It's</a> a four-way <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=831.49s">And</a> it's also a location for a bus stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=834.531s">And</a> the traffic in that area in the morning and in the evening is really, really bad, with people flying through the stop sign and then progressing down towards the Fellsway. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=844.916s">And</a> the speeding is really out of control. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=847.257s">And</a> the residents that were there that night expressed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=850.738s">And</a> so I just wanted to ask for increased patrols on that street. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=855.385s">And</a> if we could add a temporary speed bump to that street as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=860.207s">It</a> came up that night. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=861.728s">Chief</a> Sacco said, you know, he had no problems with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=866.09s">He</a> was in favor of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=867.49s">And</a> since I wrote this resolution, I've also talked to Brian Kearns as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=873.333s">And</a> I believe Sergeant Hartnett was going up to look at the situation today. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=877.835s">But</a> so that's a little bit of an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=879.536s">But</a> there are actually a couple of residents here that would like to speak on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=883.898s">So</a> if you
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=1125.791s">It's</a> a temporary speed bump that they pull up in the winter because of the plows, they can't keep it down year round. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=1130.033s">But</a> it's definitely, I think, something that would help in this situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=1135.375s">I</a> live right around the corner and I took a walk down the street and met with the residents on Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=1141.855s">And</a> it's interesting, there's a pothole in the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=1144.697s">And</a> some of them don't fill the pothole because it slows down the traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=1148.62s">Let's</a> see if it gets any bigger.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=1154.163s">And</a> that really shouldn't be the solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=1155.584s">We</a> should make sure that we fill the pothole and slow down traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=1158.926s">So</a> we're hoping that putting in that temporary speed bump would help slow down the traffic, help drivers realize that, you know what, this is a busy neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=1169.093s">There's</a> a lot of people, a lot of cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=1171.055s">This</a> is a school bus stop close by. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=1172.536s">People</a> have to drive safely. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=1174.297s">And</a> so I basically would ask a move for approval at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=1180.262s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=1180.762s">And</a> thank you for your support. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=1182.063s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=1182.463s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=1183.304s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=1183.584s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=3873.644s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=3874.284s">Councilor</a> Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=3875.404s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=3876.145s">I</a> just wanted to thank Councilor Knight for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=3877.986s">This</a> issue actually came up during a police community meeting a couple of months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=3883.649s">And</a> talking to the members of the police department, you know, they talk a lot about how surrounding communities have <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=3891.733s">cameras</a> in a lot of different intersections and whatnot, and how it's actually been key in solving crimes and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=3899.977s">And</a> our city really does not have a lot of cameras, or I don't think any cameras, really, at any of our public places. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=3906.501s">So</a> this is a resolution that I definitely support. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=3909.642s">I'd</a> also like to see if the council wouldn't mind if we could amend it to actually look at the feasibility of putting them at some intersections upon consultation with the police, of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=3920.264s">But</a> if you wouldn't mind amending the resolution, greatly appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=3926.288s">And</a> I second the motion.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4113.838s">Councilor</a> Thurgood. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4114.919s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4116.02s">And</a> the reason why I amended it was because it did come up at a police community meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4119.722s">And,</a> you know, the police officers that I talked to that were in the room and the detectives, they had mentioned that all the surrounding communities had these cameras and they're very useful in, you know, especially if a crime has happened, you know, they can always consult the cameras or if there's a car chase or something like that, or if something happens in Somerville, uh, you know, and they come through Medford, you know, this, you know, they can actually see things on tape. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4142.198s">Um,</a> a lot of times, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4144.407s">When</a> it comes to Medford, you can't see anything because there's no cameras. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4146.709s">But</a> they have them in all surrounding areas, surrounding cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4149.671s">And</a> they've been extremely helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4151.192s">I</a> know that things have happened in Medford where the people that have broken the law have gone down to cities and towns and they've consulted these cameras. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4160.96s">And</a> it's really helped out a lot from what I've <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4162.978s">from</a> what I was told that night. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4164.659s">And</a> they're all accessible right through the phone if they needed to look at a camera right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4170.34s">So</a> I think it's a good way to possibly help to solve crimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4176.142s">But</a> I don't think it's a way to go out to see if someone's speeding or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4179.823s">That's</a> not the purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4181.224s">It</a> would be to actually just to try to, after crime has been committed, to actually go back and look at a tape and say, OK, wait a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4189.687s">running</a> down Mr. Gabel, whatever it may be. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4192.429s">But</a> I think it's a good tool to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4194.571s">And</a> I think it's a really inexpensive option. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4196.672s">I</a> mean, cameras are pretty inexpensive these days. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4199.874s">And</a> so I don't think it's something, I think it's something that could be very beneficial to the police department in solving crimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4208.821s">Councilor</a> Lungo-Koehn.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4540.367s">Councilor</a> Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4541.107s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4541.988s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4543.109s">The</a> purpose of the meeting was to view and discuss government legislative management software, which includes the agenda, minutes, and video streaming the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4554.775s">It</a> was a good meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4556.176s">We</a> actually asked a lot of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4557.717s">We</a> got a nice presentation from Acela <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4560.888s">corporation.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4561.929s">They</a> have experience with the surrounding communities that also use this type of product. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4569.752s">They</a> use it in Somerville, Melrose, I believe maybe Cambridge as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4573.854s">It's</a> basically a product that will bring a lot of transparency to the process and the way we view agendas and minutes here at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4585.379s">The</a> public would have all the information at their fingertips. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4589.269s">with</a> regard to researching information if they wanted to. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4592.531s">So</a> it's a very powerful tool. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4593.791s">I</a> think it's great with regard to transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4596.753s">All</a> the reports that we get back here, they will be able to access on their phones or laptops or iPads or whatever it may be. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4605.818s">But</a> I think it's a great tool with regard to transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4609.2s">Video</a> streaming is a powerful tool as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4611.921s">It</a> would allow us to actually <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4614.588s">film</a> the meetings, the city council office, if we choose. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4618.872s">And</a> it's also great because we have a lot of boards and commissions in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4623.897s">And</a> I think a lot of people really don't know what the boards and commissions do. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4627.78s">But</a> with the agenda minutes meeting software, it would allow all of the boards and commission minutes, agenda minutes and software, all be online. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4638.303s">Really,</a> it benefits the community in many ways with regard to transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4642.186s">They'd</a> actually be able to view and see the meetings whenever they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4645.828s">So</a> everything would be online. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4646.929s">It</a> was a great meeting, went really well, great questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4650.752s">So</a> that's basically a brief synopsis. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4653.073s">Thank</a> you, Councilman.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4884.561s">20</a> was a video streaming. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4887.583s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4888.524s">But</a> I actually, I was just wondering why it took so long.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4917.785s">I'll</a> stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4918.085s">And</a> the additional monitors, I believe, were pretty inexpensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4921.027s">It</a> was not big money. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4923.338s">couple</a> hundred bucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4923.918s">Name</a> and address for the record.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4977.801s">It's</a> going to cover everything except for the <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4979.839s">extra</a> transmitters, which were actually going to be a little bit more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4983.361s">But</a> it was not that much money. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4985.043s">Because</a> I remember saying, well, this is actually, in the grand scheme of things, it was pretty inexpensive, I think, with regard to transparency and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XGMs-cDtEA&t=4992.427s">OK.</a> <h2><a href="../2017-06-07_DXZ3Y2L8Tik/2017-06-07_DXZ3Y2L8Tik.html">Medford, MA City Council - June 6, 2017 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=46.061s">Mr.</a> President, I'd like to make a motion to suspend the rules to take paper 17- Councilor Belko. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=53.564s">I'd</a> like to make a, if we could suspend the rules to take 17-515 out of order.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=231.056s">Do</a> we know how long it'll take to actually do the testing?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=261.92s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=1253.478s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=2309.15s">Councilor</a> Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=2310.31s">I</a> just had a couple of last questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=2312.476s">Alicia,</a> is all of this property, is this all City of Medford property? <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=2316.099s">Is</a> any of this property owned by DCR?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=2378.588s">So</a> DCR will hopefully eventually do borings in that area?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=2389.118s">As</a> far as, you mentioned there are two reports, one in June and one in August?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=2393.921s">And</a> can we receive copies of both of those when they are?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=2414.151s">If</a> you could send us copies, I'd greatly appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=2416.192s">And</a> just be good to <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=2417.846s">read</a> those as soon as we get them. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=2419.327s">There's</a> a lot of residents that live in that area, so it would be ideal to see what exactly, we know what the concerns are, but to see how bad it is and what's eventually going to be done.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=2451.504s">Just</a> following on the topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=2453.025s">So</a> when we had the committee, the whole meeting regarding the Clippership Connector a couple of months ago, I believe, they talked about the other side of the river as well.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=2465.059s">Is</a> that DCR property or is that?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=2472.384s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=2472.884s">Do</a> we know if there are any plans for the DCR to test that side?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=2501.425s">The</a> reason why I ask is because that night I think they did talk about putting a lane of a trail that went on that side of the river as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=2509.853s">And</a> I'm not sure if that's going to come before or after the Clippership Connector. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=2513.176s">But</a> I would think that would be a concern as well that needs to be addressed.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=2542.421s">And</a> I understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=2543.481s">But</a> I think if they're going to run, because they made it sound like that during the meeting, I think they were going to run that path down that side.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=2565.131s">That's</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=2565.531s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=5897.489s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=5900.151s">Councilor</a> Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=5901.072s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=5902.293s">Um,</a> I, I do have a couple of concerns regarding the late time, uh, stay until 2am. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=5908.779s">Um,</a> and I do like the staged approach as to, you know, just kind of maybe increasing it over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=5913.863s">So</a> I'm not completely against this, but, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=5916.446s">How</a> many drivers do you have delivering? <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=5919.247s">Right</a> now, one. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=5920.307s">One.</a> 
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=5936.491s">And</a> I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=5937.651s">And</a> that's a little bit of my concern, because if you're going to go till 2 AM, and then if you go up two drivers, you're going to have three drivers. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=5944.933s">Three</a> drivers. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=5945.313s">That's</a> three drivers. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=5947.611s">Three</a> drivers coming and going at 2 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=5950.532s">is</a> really, you got doors opening, closing. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=5954.474s">You</a> have cars driving around at 2 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=5957.356s">in</a> a residential neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=5958.877s">That's</a> a bit of a concern, to me at least. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=5961.718s">And</a> I think that it's something that needs to be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=5965.16s">I</a> wanna see you succeed, believe me. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=5967.221s">But</a> I also wanna make sure that we're safeguarding the neighborhood and making sure that people can get a good night's sleep. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=5973.284s">And</a> I mean, if you haven't, <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=5976.143s">you</a> know, three drivers going back and forth at 2 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=5979.806s">And</a> especially if you're delivering up till 2, that means they might be coming back to the shop after 2. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=5985.751s">And,</a> you know, so we're talking maybe 2.30, you know, when you really look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=5990.875s">So</a> I would definitely be, you know, in favor of the compromised proposal by Councilor Knight, you know, just kind of going in stages and maybe increasing, you know, over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=6002.545s">But,</a> you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=6004.899s">If</a> you're going to be going from one driver to three drivers and having all those cars coming and going that late at night or early in the morning, that is definitely a concern, but I am definitely in favor of the staged approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=6016.085s">So</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DXZ3Y2L8Tik&t=6017.345s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=1872.377s">I'm</a> sure we will, but I want to see something in writing, something officially as to why it was delayed. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=1876.341s">And</a> I want to find out when it's, when they plan on actually getting this kicked off and going in a process it has to go through because everyone should be on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=1886.411s">And</a> you know, it was mentioned earlier communication and a lot of this comes down to communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=1891.94s">And</a> if they actually sent the memo to us saying, you know what, this was promised last year, but it's going to be delayed, at least when the calls come in, we can say, you know what, we received the communication back from the engineer's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=1903.869s">This</a> is going to be delayed because of reasons A, B, and C. But we haven't received anything back. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=1910.814s">And</a> the neighbors haven't received any news. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=1913.196s">And</a> therefore, we're all kind of standing around looking at each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=1916.458s">So</a> a lot of it comes down to communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=1920.621s">As</a> far as this issue goes, there really hasn't been any communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=1924.162s">So</a> if we can get an official correspondence from the engineer's department with those details, I'd greatly appreciate it.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5206.87s">Councilor</a> Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5207.83s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5208.691s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this forward because this is an important issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5214.516s">And</a> zoning and ordinances, you know, it's really, it's one of our biggest responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5220.701s">We've</a> had a lot of discussions over the past term with regard to zoning and ordinances and a lot of changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5226.265s">And</a> I think a lot of, <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5228.635s">You</a> know, when we talk a lot about zoning in ordinances, a lot of it is about communication, but a lot of it is also about transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5236.401s">And</a> Gene Nozzo brings up a good point, which goes into the meeting tomorrow night with regard to legislative software. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5246.127s">And</a> that was a resolution that I brought up about a year ago with regard to legislative software. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5253.333s">And</a> finally, the meeting is going to happen tomorrow night. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5255.514s">But</a> it's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5257.365s">It</a> brings everyone onto the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5259.526s">If</a> anyone has any questions or any issues, what they can do is they can find all that information online. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5265.528s">All</a> the boards and commissions can put all of their minutes, agendas, meeting minutes, all of their, anything that has to do with plans or documents, they can all be scanned to PDF and seen online. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5279.374s">I</a> mean, all the information that we receive every week, all kinds of memos, reports, all that detail, we get it behind the reel. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5287.835s">But</a> out in the community, no one really gets to see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5292.657s">And</a> that's the unfortunate part. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5294.078s">Because</a> really, it's your government. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5298.16s">I</a> mean, you should be able to see everything with the click of a mouse. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5301.962s">All</a> the data should be at your fingertips. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5304.083s">And</a> that's what this legislative software is going to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5306.804s">And</a> I think it's well worth the money to actually invest in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5310.866s">I</a> mean, it really puts everyone on the same playing field, the same level playing field. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5317.913s">Everyone</a> has access to the data. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5319.594s">I</a> mean, I'd use a perfect example. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5322.196s">Councilman</a> Marks had asked for a number of times for a public safety summit. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5327.0s">And</a> if someone wanted to go in and research that, they could actually take a look, plug in public safety summit, and see every time it was mentioned during a council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5335.807s">So</a> they could actually go back and look at the detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5338.329s">Take</a> a look at the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5340.07s">We</a> talked about the FEMA document a few weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5342.552s">It</a> was a 138-page document. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5345.257s">really</a> probably shouldn't be printing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5346.598s">It's</a> not very green, but everyone should have a copy. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5349.078s">The</a> public should have access to it too. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5350.959s">And</a> it should be easy to access. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5352.919s">All</a> you have to do is put that PDF online and everyone has access with the click of a mouse. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5357.641s">So,</a> you know, it's important that we do more in zoning and ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5361.762s">We</a> have, I think, thank Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this issue up tonight, but really it's one of our biggest responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5368.304s">We</a> need to do more there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5369.845s">I</a> think we're heading in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5371.833s">But</a> I think really one of the big things tomorrow night is that meeting with regard to legislative software. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5377.236s">I</a> think it really will make us an informed council, but it also makes us an informed community. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5384.58s">Because</a> all the boards and commissions will have access to that data and have access to put all that information out there for the community to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5392.084s">So</a> thank you very much.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5614.286s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5615.167s">I</a> just want to send our sincere condolences to Dennis's family. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5620.112s">He</a> was a Scoutmaster down at Troop 416 on Otis Street for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5625.437s">Like</a> we said before, you know, he's very involved in the troop. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5630.26s">A</a> troop that produced many Eagle Scouts. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5634.864s">And</a> I remember going on camping with my son in the troop, and he was very involved with the youth down in that Troop 416. <a href="https://youtu.be/PYJEJj7Mrko&t=5645.353s">He</a> did a great job, and he will be missed.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3198.095s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Chairman. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3199.336s">I'm</a> reviewing the documents here and I have to admit, I'm not a big fan of the illuminated sign, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3206.464s">And</a> when I look at the signs in the square, the other thing that I like, and we're trying to, I think in many ways, the community is trying to rebrand Medford Square because we're trying to bring business in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3217.012s">And</a> when I look at these signs in other businesses, everything seems to be very uniform. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3222.896s">It's</a> all on the same level. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3224.997s">If</a> I take a look at the sign, your sign, and then I take a look at Wayside, you know, Wayside <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3232.244s">seems</a> to be in line with the rest of the businesses and you're popping up in the air a bit, you know, which seems kind of, just seems out of whack kind of. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3240.608s">I</a> mean, it seems like, you know, it doesn't seem that clean. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3244.15s">It</a> just seems like it would be nice if you could kind of get everything in one uniform way. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3249.232s">But</a> I will admit, I'm not a big fan of the illuminated signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3253.094s">Is</a> there any flexibility on that?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3277.461s">You</a> want to, I'm sorry, you want to put awnings in the place of the sign?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3749.348s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Chairman. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3750.889s">I</a> agree with my colleague, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3753.871s">I</a> actually have no problem with the signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3755.512s">I</a> actually like the signs, and I think they're fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3758.174s">There</a> is some confusion, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3759.234s">If</a> you look at these two pictures, all these signs are in the same spot.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3774.416s">But</a> like I said, I have no problem with the signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3777.119s">I</a> think the signs look fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3778.68s">They're</a> very professional. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3780.061s">They're</a> not illuminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3781.022s">They're</a> nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=3783.264s">I</a> just think going to subcommittee, I think we'll hopefully resolve some issues, clear things up, and then come before us again.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5674.258s">Councilor</a> Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5675.579s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5676.479s">Uh,</a> you had mentioned a minute ago that, uh, it's, uh, there's a periodic, uh, renewal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5682.342s">So</a> is it, is it every so many years, five years, every five years? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5685.444s">And</a> does it usually take as, does it usually take as long as this took? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5689.746s">It</a> seems like this was a bit lengthy.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5747.13s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=5747.69s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6425.639s">Councilor</a> Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6426.74s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6427.46s">I</a> have a couple of quick additional questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6429.841s">Um,</a> so you had mentioned about, uh, this being a full time position. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6434.383s">There's</a> enough work to make it a full time position.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6443.396s">In</a> your experience throughout the years, do you see other cities and towns that actually have a full-time person? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6449.26s">I'm</a> just curious.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6458.706s">Do</a> they more or less communities that maybe live closer to the coast or that are closer to the coast, I guess, or is it just in general?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6469.968s">Size,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6470.588s">That</a> makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6471.789s">And</a> as far as you had mentioned about putting a committee together, that committee's not together yet?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6480.217s">Do</a> you know when that will be? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6481.658s">When</a> the goal is to actually have the committee get together and meet?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6488.283s">Okay,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6489.344s">Sounds</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=6489.745s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7319.225s">Councilor</a> Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7320.266s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7321.086s">I</a> want to thank my council colleagues for bringing these resolutions forward tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7324.668s">Uh,</a> I've been called a number of times with regard to the, uh, Macklin road, uh, development. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7329.671s">And,</a> um, I had the opportunity to, uh, to attend the, uh, the conservation commission meeting along with you actually on April 19th. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7337.676s">And,</a> uh, it was at the, uh, community development board meeting last week with council of marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7341.938s">I</a> had to leave a little bit early. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7342.979s">My</a> son had a band concert, but, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7346.163s">the</a> residents in this neighborhood, uh, up in the Macklin road area have really rallied behind this to, uh, see what they can do, um, to, to, you know, hopefully prevent or at least make this small than it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7358.09s">I</a> mean, my colleagues mentioned tonight, there are a lot of concerns with regard to, uh, what putting in three new homes you're going to bring to this neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7366.855s">Uh,</a> you go down McCormick, have you drive down McCormick have tonight, you will see hoses coming out of the basements of these homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7372.826s">And</a> they are constantly pumping water out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7375.507s">The</a> sub pumps are going nonstop. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7377.707s">And</a> no one should have to live like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7379.628s">And</a> I think by putting in three new homes, it's completely going to exasperate the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7385.369s">So</a> I think that we really have to take the city or the Conservation Commission and the Community Development Board really have to take this under consideration when looking at a development like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7396.412s">So</a> major flooding is a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7402.655s">You</a> know, I think disrupting the ground in that area, I mean, you know, you're near a brook. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7406.817s">I</a> mean, that's completely unknown what's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7408.859s">The</a> water has to flow somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7410.96s">So</a> this is a concern as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7413.181s">You</a> know, Council Marks mentioned that water pressure in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7416.103s">A</a> lot of friends that live up there in, you know, water pressure is tough, tough on that street in particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7422.006s">You</a> know, someone called me and said, you know, I can't, you know, take a shower and have someone flush the toilet at the same time or else the water, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7428.83s">completely</a> shuts down almost. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7430.151s">So,</a> I mean, that's a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7431.671s">You</a> go to environmental issues, you take a look, this developer has already cut down one tree within the buffer zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7439.875s">And</a> that's completely blatant disrespect to our ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7444.317s">I</a> mean, that's completely wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7445.998s">And</a> so, you know, I mean, I think, you know, when they're cutting down trees in a buffer zone, you know, right away that should send up red flags, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7455.946s">Like</a> my colleagues mentioned, they're proposing three homes on this cul-de-sac. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7460.871s">And</a> one of the homes is within the wetlands buffer zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7465.014s">And</a> I think we have to be really careful here as a city, because if you're going to allow something like this, you're setting precedent for future development. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7471.74s">You're</a> setting precedent for other homes in other wetland-type areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7476.344s">We</a> need to watch out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7478.225s">It's</a> completely wrong, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7480.948s">Kudos</a> to the citizens, really, for stepping up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7484.07s">But</a> I think there was probably 60 to 70, 75 people at the Conservation Commission meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7490.474s">There</a> were a lot of residents here last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7492.255s">And</a> I give them a lot of credit, because both of those meetings have been continued. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7496.797s">So</a> it's meeting after meeting, week after week. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7499.378s">So</a> I really applaud your tenacity of going after this and staying on top of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7505.081s">And</a> I think that's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7507.443s">But</a> really, there's a lot of concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7512.632s">You're</a> trying to think out of the box here a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7515.294s">You</a> mentioned Council Marks, how there's 14 other lots that are unbuildable. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7520.377s">And</a> everyone's trying to come here and build. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7524.08s">But</a> I mean, we take a look at the CPA and how we passed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7528.67s">The</a> community passed that last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7531.853s">I</a> know the CPA here is in its infancy, but this is something that really, you talk about open space and stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7539.159s">This</a> is something that probably could be considered, that the city could maybe purchase at some point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7544.783s">And</a> I'm not saying one of the first projects, but maybe down the line they could purchase this in a place of conservation restriction on the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7552.229s">So</a> you can't build on it in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7554.428s">And</a> I think that's, you know, these are things that we need to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7557.45s">But,</a> you know, I did promise a resident tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7561.833s">It's</a> really been on top of the situation since, you know, there's a resident up on McCormick Ave, Will Humphreys, nice guy, and he's been on top of this since this came about, this whole issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7573.942s">And</a> he said, you know, he couldn't make it to the meeting tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7576.504s">And</a> like I said, I mean, these residents have been going to meetings nonstop. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7580.962s">And</a> he said, can you please read a letter for me? <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7582.403s">And</a> I said, absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7583.424s">I</a> mean, if he's going to be here tomorrow night, then he's going to be at a meeting next week, whenever the Conservation Commission meets. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7590.889s">I</a> said, no problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7591.729s">I'll</a> read the letter for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7593.49s">And</a> I'll submit this into the public record. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7595.011s">I'll</a> make a copy for you, Mr. Finn. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7598.454s">To</a> whom it may concern, I'm ready to ask Method elected representatives, commissions, and boards to listen to its citizens when considering this development. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7607.18s">Thank</a> you to the Environment Department and Conservation Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7611.03s">in</a> the Community Development Office and Board, the City Engineer, the City Council, and the ongoing attention to the many problems with this subdivision proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7619.314s">The</a> community that surrounds this development is speaking out with a unified voice of concern and opposition. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7627.897s">Many</a> citizens attended meetings on the proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7631.219s">Concerns</a> expressed include loss of storm and flood water retention capacity, increased <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7638.658s">throughput</a> to sewer and water systems that are already strained. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7642.321s">Damage</a> to existing homes and extensive blasting of ledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7645.844s">Loss</a> of aesthetically pleasing natural green space. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7650.588s">Wildlife</a> habitat destruction and damage to wetlands. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7654.451s">Increased</a> traffic near Carr Park and the Tot Lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7657.503s">Access</a> Issues and Disturbance to Direct the Butter on Macklin Road were a non-profit organization that provides services to several long-time residents with developmental disabilities at the home. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7671.247s">He</a> also goes on to say that he included a petition of 115 Medford residents, representing much of the surrounding neighborhood, echoing these same concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7682.482s">in</a> its current state is of great value to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7685.663s">This</a> is the opposite of an abandoned building in need of improvement or environmental cleanup. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7691.645s">The</a> surrounding neighborhood is unified in opposition to the proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7695.086s">No</a> public benefit is served through development of the subdivision. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7699.147s">Medford's</a> assessors has long considered 13 of the 14 lots as undevelopable when assessing their value. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7707.452s">Therefore,</a> the city should not grant any waivers or variances to existing regulations around roadways, setbacks, zoning, and building codes, or environmental protections. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7717.28s">Those</a> regulations exist to protect our city, its citizens, and its ecosystems. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7722.604s">If</a> the regulations can't be adhered to, then the land should not be developed upon. <a

href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7730.19s">Like</a> I said, I will print out a copy of that letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7732.812s">But</a> I think, you know, one of the, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7735.585s">things</a> just to conclude on is that, you know, this is a unique piece of land in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7742.047s">Um,</a> you know, it's, it's one of the few remaining areas within the city of Medford that has, you know, woodland habitat and you know, we really need to preserve this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7750.11s">So</a> I just wanted to go on the record and saying that I thank my colleagues for bringing this up for tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7754.372s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7968.218s">From</a> what I've been told, they've been more questions than answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7973.081s">I</a> guess the developer has not been really able to answer much.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7977.785s">So</a> no vote's been taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7979.286s">They</a> have to go in front of the Conservation Commission again tomorrow night. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7982.268s">And</a> then they're going again. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7983.348s">They're</a> going in front of the Community Development Board again. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7987.231s">I</a> don't know the date of that meeting, but there were a ton of questions from both commissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7993.815s">And</a> the developer needs to get back to both boards <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7998.475s">with</a> the answers to those questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=7999.856s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8040.33s">I'm</a> under the same impression that everyone's going to be able to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8043.071s">And</a> hopefully, the developer will have answers to the questions that the commission had. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8049.772s">Because</a> they had, I think, a laundry list of questions that needed to be answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8053.253s">And</a> I believe that the Conservation Commission was actually going. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8056.514s">They</a> had done one site visit. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8058.574s">And</a> I think they were going to do, or at least there was one member that actually wanted to go out and look at the wetlands, I think, to actually physically see the space.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8071.416s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8072.197s">Vice</a> President Mox.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8594.576s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8595.476s">I</a> just wanted to thank Councilor Marksley for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8598.517s">Uh,</a> this is a definite concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8600.177s">Um,</a> you go through, uh, each neighbor, this dumps all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8604.358s">So</a> I would definitely be in favor of a ordinance to, uh, to police this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8608.639s">Um,</a> I think that it's long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8611.14s">Um,</a> you know, it's sad that, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8613.054s">When</a> you have stumps out there year after year, they need to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8617.555s">And</a> they should be addressed right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8619.976s">To</a> me, it's a safety issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8621.397s">You</a> have kids walking down the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8622.637s">We're</a> encouraging people to walk. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8625.098s">We</a> have a complete streets program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8627.158s">And</a> you're encouraging people to get out there and walk, but you're forcing people into the street when there's stumps all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8635.161s">And</a> I think it needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8636.801s">I</a> got a call from a resident the other day. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8638.342s">He</a> has a tree on his sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8640.983s">It's</a> popping up the panel. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8642.737s">the</a> curbs falling away from the, from the side is separating from the sidewalk and that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8648.742s">And</a> you know, so we have issues like this all over our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8651.625s">It</a> doesn't matter what neighborhood you're in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8653.046s">Um,</a> they're out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8654.527s">And,</a> uh, so I'd be in full support of, uh, in ordinance to police this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8658.29s">I</a> think it's a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8659.191s">And</a> if you wouldn't mind me, uh, amending your resolution, if we could have, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8665.682s">49</a> Bradshaw Street added to the list of sidewalk repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8670.084s">Just</a> if the DPW could go out there and take a look.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8750.904s">So</a> if I could have a B paper for the DPW to look at the sidewalk panel in front of, to actually the side, it's a corner lot, the corner of Honeywell and, uh,
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8763.61s">And</a> if I could also add.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8790.734s">in</a> Honeywell, it's the corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8793.776s">It's</a> a raised sidewalk panel.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8801.221s">Yes,</a> if we could have the DPW department or whatever utility is responsible for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8807.606s">There</a> is not a half pole, not a double pole, it's a mini pole at the corner of Fulton Spring and Fulton Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8814.331s">It's</a> gotta be about four feet off the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8816.988s">Definite</a> safety hazard. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8818.128s">I</a> mean, there's kids all over the place there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8820.169s">It's</a> not a tree stump. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8821.049s">It's</a> a telephone pole. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8822.029s">It</a> used to be a double pole.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=8823.83s">And</a> then they cut it down and it's like a mini pole.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9908.151s">Councilor</a> Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9909.191s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9910.011s">I</a> want to thank my council colleagues, <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9912.48s">Councilor</a> Marksley, bring this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9915.561s">This</a> is definitely a concern in every neighborhood throughout our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9918.943s">And</a> I would definitely be in favor of having a committee, the whole meeting to discuss this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9925.066s">It's,</a> you know, we talk about emergency arteries, but this is just everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9928.748s">I</a> mean, you go to, you can go to probably every side street, you're going to find something. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9933.09s">But</a> I mean, there are some major issues throughout our community, in every neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9938.632s">And</a> I get calls about them, just like my colleagues do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9943.826s">If</a> I could add the lower half of Fern Road to that list, there is a hole that's getting bigger by the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9952.331s">So</a> if we could add that on, I'd greatly appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9955.733s">It</a> needs to be addressed because someone is seriously gonna do some serious damage to their car. <a href="https://youtu.be/Buu0dDHgsRo&t=9960.876s">So</a> thank you very much.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5053.506s">Councilor</a> Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5054.447s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5055.167s">I</a> just wanted to thank Councilor Lungo-Koehn for bringing this forward tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5060.171s">I,</a> too, wanted to congratulate everyone involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5063.353s">It</a> was a successful event. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5064.874s">Hopefully,</a> it's something that we see or continue to see every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5068.016s">And</a> especially, thank you to, like my fellow councilors said, the DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5073.48s">I</a> did get there late, but everyone I talked to said that the DPW came through big time. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5078.263s">And</a> they were everywhere, and they helped out with everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5083.257s">you</a> know, like I said, hopefully this continues into the future, so thank you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5130.128s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5131.389s">Last</a> night I had the opportunity to attend the aircraft noise in Medford meeting here, right in these council chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5140.024s">You</a> were there yourself, and Councilor Lungo-Koehn was there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5144.167s">And</a> it was actually a great turnout. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5146.708s">There</a> was probably about 150 people here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5149.61s">And</a> a big thank you to Peter Houck from the Massport CAC and Luke Fraser from Logan CAC. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5158.376s">They're</a> both of our volunteers that serve on those boards. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5163.159s">And</a> they put together a great presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5165.621s">It</a> lasted probably about an hour and a half, two hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5168.942s">And</a> they put together a 33-page presentation, which is, I believe, on the city website. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5174.724s">And</a> I would definitely encourage everyone to read it over. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5177.765s">It</a> was a great talk about how this is really affecting the quality of life here in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5184.407s">Regardless</a> of what neighborhood you live in, it really has had a negative impact on everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5191.69s">And</a> it's something that they did a great job at describing how things used to be and how <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5197.972s">Things</a> have basically happened over the years where they've streamlined the routes, and they tend to fly all over Medford, unfortunately. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5205.634s">And</a> the interesting thing is, is this is a problem that's really not going to go away. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5211.055s">They</a> talked about the modernization of Terminal E, which, just to let people know, there's going to be five additional low-cost carriers will offer 23 new flights a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5225.907s">mostly</a> from the international terminal. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5229.068s">Flights</a> will not leave at peak times at 2, 3, 5, and 8. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5231.888s">They'll</a> leave at off-peak times. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5234.989s">There's</a> going to be bigger airplanes flying in. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5237.329s">The</a> A380, which carries a lot more than your regular plane, and it's two decks. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5243.51s">It's</a> a double-decker airline. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5245.65s">They</a> talked basically about everything from how the patterns change during the weather and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5252.052s">But</a> an interesting thing is, in 2015, the airport <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5255.894s">Terminal</a> E, in particular, served 5.5 million international passengers. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5260.415s">And</a> by 2030, that's going to go up by 8 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5264.036s">It's</a> going to go up to 8 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5266.376s">So</a> there's going to be significant increases here with regard to passengers, but also to planes. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5271.857s">And</a> one of the big things that they pointed out is that, you know, you take a look at other surrounding communities, and really, we don't, as residents here in this city, we actually do not complain enough to Massport <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5285.462s">about</a> this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5287.143s">So</a> people really have to start to call, start to log complaints online. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5293.344s">If</a> you'd like to go online, you can go to massport.com slash environment slash environmental reporting slash noise abatement slash noise complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5305.028s">And</a> you can also call the noise complaint line at 617-561-3333. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5314.498s">I</a> would encourage everyone, if you have the opportunity to really log on to the city website, take a look through this presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5322.101s">They</a> did a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5323.862s">Like</a> I said, 33 pages. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5325.782s">It's</a> full of all kinds of information about aircraft noise, departures, how the hotline works with regard to complaining, and the best way to actually complain. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5339.388s">So</a> they do have a lot of helpful hints here, but overall, <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5343.253s">Like</a> I said, thanks to Peter Howick and to Luke Preissner who put this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5346.795s">They</a> did a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5347.735s">And</a> I would encourage people to call Massport, especially with the warm-up months coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5354.259s">People</a> like to spend time in the yard. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5356.06s">This</a> is going to be an issue, so people should call. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5358.761s">So</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ikc9Lg8Y0c&t=5359.362s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Palacio. <a

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7332.517s">Councilor</a> Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7333.517s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7334.297s">I</a> want to thank Councilor Lomax for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7336.158s">I</a> think this is a great resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7338.178s">I</a> think it's something that needs to be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7341.179s">I</a> know that I've received many phone calls when I bump into people in the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7345.4s">A</a> lot of people will talk about the cleanliness of the roads in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7350.241s">And</a> this is something that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7353.213s">But</a> I, you know, Councilor Marks, you do bring up a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7355.514s">I</a> think that this is something that should probably be in a city ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7358.936s">I</a> mean, this does, I think, hold the city's feet to the fire and says, hey, you know what, this needs to be done X amount of times a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7366.079s">I</a> mean, two times a year right now to me is just not acceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7369.76s">I</a> mean, people pay their taxes here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7371.681s">They</a> deserve to have clean streets and a clean city. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7374.742s">And</a> I think right now, you know, you go, you drive down many of the streets and, you know, there's debris all over the place, you know, with regard to, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7381.132s">sand,</a> salt, rocks from the road being torn up after the winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7386.434s">And</a> basically, these things need to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7392.857s">And</a> it wasn't even a bad winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7394.657s">So</a> when you have a really bad winter, the street can be a real mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7398.559s">So</a> I mean, I think I definitely would favor this to be in a city ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7406.422s">I</a> think that's the way we need to go long term. <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=7410.401s">DPW</a> subcommittee, I think that's fine, but I think we need to also look at this, you know, on the ordinance subcommittee as well.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pHtJcMxcqAQ&t=9726.691s">The</a> worst is when you get information tonight and you're trying to digest it during the meeting.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=294.374s">One</a> quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=295.015s">Uh,</a> when will, uh, do we know when the work's taking place?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=308.716s">And</a> do we know how long it's going to take?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=318.62s">And</a> if I may, really quick, Councilor Scott, probably brought up a good point about a pole. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=325.624s">I</a> got a call the other day about a pole at the corner of Fulton Street and Fulton Spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=329.792s">It</a> was a double pole, and now it's one and a half poles. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=332.294s">They</a> literally cut it in half. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=334.195s">It's</a> like a stump.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=337.238s">There's</a> nothing on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=337.838s">It's</a> about four feet off the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=339.099s">It's</a> kind of odd. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=340.94s">You</a> have one single pole, and there's a pole next to it that was a double pole at one point. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=345.744s">And</a> now it's just about four feet off the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=348.025s">To</a> me, it's a bit of a safety hazard if you have a smaller child that's walking by or running in trips. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=352.429s">And</a> I think it's a problem that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=355.451s">I</a> will take a look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=356.372s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=357.172s">It's</a> a corner of Fulton Street and Fulton Spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=360.282s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TtARn8tfOxM&t=361.362s">Councilor</a> Knife.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1109.084s">More</a> than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1109.545s">OK,</a> yeah, one million. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1110.685s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1112.206s">So</a> $1 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1113.326s">And</a> we've reduced that. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1115.087s">So</a> that's a significant reduction. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1117.848s">And</a> those dollars are coming back, and they're in our school district. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1121.93s">And</a> I mean, the partnerships that you've built, the vision that you had, it's just been amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1127.673s">And</a> you haven't even been in the district that long. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1130.594s">So</a> you've had quite an impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1132.695s">And</a> you know, everybody you talk to, <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1134.883s">Um,</a> you know, vocational, you know, technical, uh, technical, um, school. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1141.466s">I</a> mean, really vocational education is the rage right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1144.688s">I</a> mean, every, a lot of kids want to go to the book, go to method technical school. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1148.95s">And,</a> uh, you know, the way I look at it is it's the best of both worlds because you can learn a trade and you can go to college if you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1156.433s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1156.693s">And</a> I think those are valuable tools. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1158.854s">And,</a> um, to come here with this news tonight, um, I mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1163.365s">To</a> see that all the partnerships that you've formed and the in-kind donations that are coming in, it's just remarkable. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1171.087s">This</a> is something that I support 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1173.007s">And</a> I think that the other thing you're trying to do is you're trying to build the alumni network, which I think is huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1184.109s">And</a> I'm going to plug. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1186.37s">Yeah,</a> absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1187.15s">You</a> have an event coming up.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1883.714s">Councilor</a> Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1884.594s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1886.115s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Superintendent Felsen. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1889.757s">Thanks</a> for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1890.957s">I</a> agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1892.717s">The</a> building is 50 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1894.318s">It</a> was going to be 50 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1896.378s">It</a> definitely needs improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1898.479s">I</a> talk to parents on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1902.341s">And</a> a lot of parents that don't have kids at the high school yet, but they've been up to the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1907.623s">And</a> the building does need work. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1909.644s">When</a> I was on the school committee with Councilor Scarpelli, we had the science lab renovation, 17 new science labs, which was <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1921.124s">a</a> great project for the community, for the school system, and really, you know, the state-of-the-art school labs and science labs. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1929.827s">And</a> these are important, especially for programming, future programming for the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1936.369s">And,</a> you know, we want to make sure that we have these programs in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1939.97s">We</a> want to make sure our buildings are up to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1942.851s">I</a> mean, there's one thing that I learned when I was on the school committee is people have an option. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1947.885s">people</a> have a choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1949.025s">Years</a> ago, you went to Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1951.246s">Maybe</a> you went to parochial school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1952.746s">Now</a> you can go to public school, public charter school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1955.307s">You</a> can go to private school, parochial school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1957.047s">I</a> mean, there's all kinds of options for people now. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1959.327s">So</a> I think a lot of people would like to go to school right here in Medford, but they want to make sure that their facilities are first class in nature and make sure that the programs that are being offered, for example, at the vocational school, are first rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1976.091s">And</a> I think we're heading in that direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1978.442s">But</a> I think we do need a cash infusion to make sure that a lot of this happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1982.184s">And</a> it's nice to see that to potentially get 55% reimbursement from the state, that doesn't come along every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1989.807s">And</a> we took advantage of that opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1992.428s">When</a> the science labs came across, I think we got 55, maybe even a little bit more, a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1999.311s">Between</a> 55 and 60%, I think, reimbursement on those. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2002.473s">So</a> I think this is a great opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2005.494s">And</a> I think that it's something that we should take advantage of. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2008.773s">One</a> of the questions that I had with regard to, you mentioned HVAC. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2013.774s">So</a> would the HVAC include the actual individual heating systems in each of the classrooms at the high school? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2018.656s">Okay,</a> that's perfect because I know one of the complaints that I got when I was on the school committee was, you know, it'd be hot and cold in some of the buildings and sometimes there'd be no heat at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2028.719s">So</a> I think that would be a definite good addition. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2035.604s">I</a> also want to talk about the, let's see, you mentioned here in this memo it says, number seven, replacement of or addition to obsolete buildings in order to provide a full range of programs consistent with state and approved local requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2051.535s">MPS</a> is seeking additional space on the high school campus by adding a cafeteria that can accommodate up to at least 500 students, a performing arts center that can accommodate up to 1,000 guests, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2061.75s">adequate</a> locker room facilities for male and female athletes, a fitness and wellness center, and expansion of vocational technical space to create a career pathway model. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2072.952s">Can</a> you comment on that a little bit? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2074.453s">Is</a> that talking about possibly a new structure, or is that building off the structures that we currently have?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2311.926s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2314.027s">I</a> agree with you with regard to the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2317.306s">In</a> my opinion, I think it's the hidden jewel of the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2319.747s">I</a> mean, there are so many great opportunities that are happening at the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2324.249s">You</a> know, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2325.189s">Riccio</a> and her staff are doing a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2328.03s">And</a> I mean, there's so much demand now to go to the vocational school, and it's kind of the best of both worlds. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2333.992s">You</a> learn a trade, and you can still go to college if you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2336.793s">So</a> you really, you have the best of both worlds. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2340.535s">It's</a> an exciting time. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2341.375s">There</a> are more and more young kids going to the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2344.997s">It's</a> a great time to reinvest, not only in the high school, but in the shops of the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2351.081s">I</a> mean, when you think about it, at the end of the day, our buildings are our most important assets with regard to the future of Method students. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2358.325s">We</a> need to make sure that they are first class and make sure that all of our technology is current as can be. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2367.311s">You</a> had mentioned previously about the potential for feasibility studies. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2373.07s">So</a> if we have to do a feasibility study, is that something that we would have to pay for, or is that something that would be, would the MSBA help out with the cost of something like that?

<a href="https://youtu.be/kYO2fzmzlk8&t=1169.28s">And</a> he looked at me, he said, Mr. Falco, we're doing nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kYO2fzmzlk8&t=1172.201s">And</a> that was Mr. Edwards. <a href="https://youtu.be/kYO2fzmzlk8&t=1173.301s">That</a> was back in 2010. <a href="https://youtu.be/kYO2fzmzlk8&t=1174.202s">And</a> so what I did then is I offered a motion, a resolution, that <a href="https://youtu.be/kYO2fzmzlk8&t=1180.018s">the</a> school committee go out and tour each of the buildings throughout our community to actually see what's broken, what's fixed, and to have committee of the whole meetings to actually see firsthand as a group what needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/kYO2fzmzlk8&t=1193.603s">And</a> we did that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kYO2fzmzlk8&t=1195.044s">And</a> it was very effective. <a href="https://youtu.be/kYO2fzmzlk8&t=1196.644s">And</a> we all went all at the same time to each of the facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/kYO2fzmzlk8&t=1200.606s">So</a> how the buildings were being taken care of, what was broken, what was fixed, what needed to be addressed, what needed to be addressed right away so we could appropriate money in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/kYO2fzmzlk8&t=1208.864s">Now,</a> in the draft capital plan that we got a glimpse at back a little while ago, there's some money there in the upcoming years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kYO2fzmzlk8&t=1218.106s">I</a> think it's about $2.5 million for firehouse improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/kYO2fzmzlk8&t=1222.347s">And</a> if Councilor Marks wouldn't mind, I'd like to amend the resolution that we schedule Committee of the Whole to go to each firehouse in the city as a group so we can take a look at the issues <a href="https://youtu.be/kYO2fzmzlk8&t=1237.073s">Because</a> there are issues out there that need to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/kYO2fzmzlk8&t=1239.914s">And</a> we can go from building to building and see what needs to be done, what's broken, what needs to be repaired. <a href="https://youtu.be/kYO2fzmzlk8&t=1245.556s">I</a> mean, and he's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kYO2fzmzlk8&t=1246.777s">I</a> mean, I went to the fire station in West Bedford. <a href="https://youtu.be/kYO2fzmzlk8&t=1249.498s">I</a> mean, the gear is right behind the truck. <a href="https://youtu.be/kYO2fzmzlk8&t=1251.779s">I</a> mean, 15 feet from the truck is all the fire gear. <a href="https://youtu.be/kYO2fzmzlk8&t=1255.4s">I</a> mean, it's dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/kYO2fzmzlk8&t=1256.921s">And</a> cancer's a major concern, and we need to <a href="https://youtu.be/kYO2fzmzlk8&t=1260.012s">make</a> sure that we're addressing these situations, but just general situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/kYO2fzmzlk8&t=1263.573s">When</a> I was down in the West Medford fire station, I think the shower had no door on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kYO2fzmzlk8&t=1268.876s">So</a> I mean, you know, that, that's, that's to me that that should be a simple fix. <a href="https://youtu.be/kYO2fzmzlk8&t=1273.678s">And,</a> uh, you know, it shouldn't, they shouldn't have to wait forever to get a door fixed in the shower. <a href="https://youtu.be/kYO2fzmzlk8&t=1278.5s">If</a> you take a look at some of our buildings, I mean, when I went down to South Medford and went to West, you take a look at the, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/kYO2fzmzlk8&t=1284.795s">And</a> actually, I'm trying to think of Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kYO2fzmzlk8&t=1286.376s">Salem</a> Street did have the same issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/kYO2fzmzlk8&t=1287.937s">If</a> you take a look at the heating, it's terribly inefficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/kYO2fzmzlk8&t=1292.799s">It's</a> 1,000 degrees in one room. <a href="https://youtu.be/kYO2fzmzlk8&t=1295.401s">You</a> have to open up the windows to cool it down in the middle of the winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/kYO2fzmzlk8&t=1299.583s">And</a> these are things that need to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/kYO2fzmzlk8&t=1301.844s">We</a> should have our environmental Alicia Hunt go down and take a look to see if there's anything that we could be doing to make these buildings more cost effective, more efficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/kYO2fzmzlk8&t=1310.809s">They</a> are older buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/kYO2fzmzlk8&t=1312.406s">So</a> these need to be a top priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/kYO2fzmzlk8&t=1314.707s">So</a> if I could amend the resolution that, Mr. President, if you could schedule a committee, the whole meetings, so we could go out and take a look at each facility as a group and take a look at what needs to be addressed, because the budget's coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/kYO2fzmzlk8&t=1327.592s">We</a> need to make sure that we have maintenance in there to do these things, but we also need to make sure that we can prioritize these items when it comes to when we look at our capital budget.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kYO2fzmzlk8&t=1337.236s">That's</a> fine with me.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=7915.429s">Do</a> you know if, has anybody taken a look at what that would cost?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=7988.12s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/eMn9IArfaTE&t=7988.5s">Thank</a> you for your hard work.<h2><a href="../2017-10-02_-PNN_I18g2E/2017-10-02_-PNN_I18g2E.html">Medford, MA City Council - Feb. 7, 2017 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=49.747s">We</a> can suspend the rules to take 16-574 out of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=54.171s">Tonight</a> the Committee of the Whole met regarding the University Accountability Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=60.195s">We</a> had discussed it last week on the council floor and it got moved to subcommittee and we discussed it tonight and there are a number of <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=68.82s">Amendments</a> to the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=70.841s">And</a> of the amendments, we have that the administration provide assistance for code enforcement when we receive the report back from Tufts University, that Tufts looks into landlords registering with Tufts University. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=88.408s">Notifications</a> be sent from the building commissioner to all realtors in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=95.415s">And</a> the last amendment was that the zoning ordinance go out with the next tax bill so that everyone in the community is aware of the ordinance change with regard to the University Accountability Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=108.957s">So</a> at this point, I'd like to make a motion that the committee report be adopted as amended and the ordinance take its first reading.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=464.11s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=464.851s">If</a> I may ask Mr. Cairns a quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=475.15s">So</a> the work was, did you say the work was done in house by city employees?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=480.651s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=480.991s">Perfect.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=481.492s">I</a> like to see what we do work inside. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=483.412s">Um,</a> so as far as, uh, so how much did we save actually by keeping it in house and doing it with our own employees as to contracting it out?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=497.235s">That's</a> what I'm thinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=497.776s">I</a> mean, it's, it's, uh, I know, um, you know, we have some talented people here that can do a lot of work of, you know,
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=504.731s">It</a> would be great if we had more people, but it would be interesting to see how much of a savings this would represent by doing it in-house. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=511.895s">So</a> I'm glad we did it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=513.576s">And</a> I'm sorry, did you say how many more we have to do, or how many more we need to do?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=525.544s">OK,</a> great.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1180.729s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1182.33s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1183.123s">I</a> just have a question in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1184.623s">Um,</a> you know, of course safety and the wellbeing of personnel is always a top priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1188.585s">So</a> with regard to, um, the turndown gear, um, so if this gets approved, when can we actually see, you know, the, the turndown gear, the, the police cars, the, uh, uh, the new trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1201.349s">I</a> mean, when, when, when will, when we, when will, when will we actually see this?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1211.721s">So</a> if we approve this tonight, is the turn down gear gonna be, you know, I'm sorry, turn out gear, I apologize.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1699.51s">Thank</a> you, Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1700.67s">So</a> with regard to the new cruisers, the marked and unmarked, so we're buying new cruisers, which is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1706.533s">We</a> need them. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1707.473s">But</a> as far as the, what should be our strategy for purchasing going forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1711.955s">Should</a> we be replacing cruisers? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1713.595s">I</a> mean, in your opinion, you've been <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1715.381s">doing</a> this for a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1716.461s">What</a> should the city be doing moving forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1719.423s">Should</a> we be buying them every year, every few years? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1721.303s">What's</a> the best approach?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2293.74s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2294.461s">I</a> actually have one more question for Commissioner Kearns. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2301.275s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2302.996s">So</a> last year I had a resolution to buy a sidewalk plow, to look into buying a sidewalk plow. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2309.86s">Because</a> we're trying to push a lot of pedestrian initiatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2314.223s">We</a> have Walk Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2316.964s">We</a> have a Complete Streets program now. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2318.765s">So</a> we're really trying to encourage people to get out, walk, be pedestrians, and use public transportation and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2326.53s">So</a> I don't see anything here for a sidewalk plow. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2330.562s">It</a> didn't make the cut, and I understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2332.103s">But</a> do we have any type of machinery right now that we could use to plow sidewalks in our community, especially city-owned sidewalks?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2360.172s">those</a> can use like I would just like I mean I'm thinking like if I think of you know I think of like yeah like a bombardier or something like that a trackless plow you know because those things those type of plows and when I looked into it I mean it could zip right down a sidewalk especially in your uh you know your business communities <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2379.408s">With</a> regard to schools, I remember when I was on the school committee, we get calls all the time where kids walking to school will be forced out into the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2386.593s">Like</a> if you walk by Gillis Park down Fulton Street, you're walking to the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2389.855s">You're</a> forced out into the street because it's a city-owned sidewalk, but there's no machinery that we really have to plow something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2396.44s">So</a> I mean, I think it's something that should be considered. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2398.501s">I</a> wish I was on here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2401.043s">I'm</a> happy with what's here, believe me, and I will vote for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2403.905s">And</a> I'm 100% in favor of it, but I think it's something that we need to consider in the future.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2500.264s">I</a> agree with you 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2501.324s">I</a> mean, I know when I researched the trackless plow, <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2504.284s">and</a> it could be used to, there was one that could be used to grind stumps. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2510.949s">There</a> were uses for, you know, summer, you could use it for hauling debris and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2515.972s">So,</a> but hoping in the future that we'll see something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2520.215s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2520.956s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4045.973s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4047.434s">Basically,</a> every night they line up. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4049.056s">They</a> park on Forest Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4050.957s">They're</a> big, bulky trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4052.178s">So</a> for anyone that lives in the old Medford High School condominiums, it's really hard to navigate that area and to get out of the parking lot in the morning and at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4062.146s">So</a> it's become a bit of a safety hazard. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4065.189s">So</a> if we could just, if the chief and the mayor reach out to the US Postal Service, the Medford branch, <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4071.182s">And</a> just find out, I guess, what the strategy is with regard to those trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4078.008s">Because</a> it seems like over the years from what I'm hearing, there's more and more trucks all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4083.313s">It</a> used to be just a few. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4084.274s">Now</a> there's a bunch. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4085.515s">I</a> went down Forest Street on Sunday morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4088.878s">They</a> were all lined up. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4091.32s">They</a> took all the parking spaces in front of the old Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4094.841s">If</a> we could find out if they have plans to actually find additional parking somewhere in the city for these vehicles, because it's becoming a safety hazard and something needs to be done about it.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4120.932s">Thank</a> you, and if I may, Mr. President, I believe there is a member of the community that would like to speak on this issue, or maybe a few.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4993.997s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4994.919s">Throughout</a> the years, I've gone to many Board of Appeals meetings just to see different, just to, you know, when the different issues come up on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5007.346s">just</a> go down and take a look to see what's going on in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5010.447s">And</a> I've gotten calls from other people as well that have attended these meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5014.608s">And</a> usually, the meetings are held in room 201, for the most part. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5019.19s">And</a> in room 201, there's very limited seating. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5022.611s">I</a> think it's about maybe 20 seats, a table up in the front. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5026.512s">And</a> it seems like any meeting you go to, if there's a big issue, there are a number of people just standing in the hallways. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5032.574s">They</a> can't weigh in on any type of issue, or they have to wait in line. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5037.237s">or</a> they miss the presentation that maybe the developer's giving, and it just doesn't seem, in this day and age, like it's a proper place to have a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5047.186s">There's</a> no audio-visual equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5049.248s">It's</a> just too small. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5051.77s">I</a> don't find it very transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5053.112s">If</a> you have to wait in the hallway, and you can't even hear what's going on in the room, it doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5058.096s">We</a> live in a big city. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5059.558s">Over</a> 55,000, close to 60,000 people live here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5064.272s">This</a> community is hot for development. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5066.513s">People</a> want to develop. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5068.114s">And</a> there are many development meetings and zoning board decisions that have happened in the past, and that will be happening in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5075.418s">And</a> everyone should be able to weigh in on these different issues that come before the zoning board. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5083.662s">If</a> I may finish. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5086.688s">So</a> in my opinion, I believe that those meetings should be held here in chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5091.732s">I</a> know they meet on Tuesday night usually, which is the same night as us. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5094.634s">But</a> what they can do is maybe they can move to Wednesday nights. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5098.357s">They</a> can pick a different night. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5099.818s">Wednesday</a> nights, I don't think this chamber is being used on a regular basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5103.201s">But</a> it needs to be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5105.287s">We</a> need to make this process, we need to bring the process into the 21st century where people can come, if there's a presentation, they can use the AV equipment here, but it shouldn't be in a room where you can barely fit 20 people and people feel like they're excluded. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5120.258s">You</a> know, government should be transparent, that's what it's all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5123.621s">People</a> should have access, and I think this would be a better venue.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5136.721s">If</a> we could amend it to actually have them move their night to Wednesday night and have it here in council chambers.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5521.939s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5522.819s">And</a> I want to thank everyone for their amendments and their concerns and for supporting this. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5529.942s">But</a> I also wanted to mention as well, because we talked about other boards and commissions and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5534.563s">And</a> just to mention that I'm in the process of trying, and I know I've talked to you about this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5542.637s">in</a> the process of trying to schedule the legislative software vendor to come in and basically take a look at what we do with regard to transparency and whatnot with regards to boards and commissions because in addition to putting everything online, which actually helps out with transparency, they can also install cameras in the council meeting room as well, which would help out with other boards and commissions because you could film all these meetings and they could all be, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5572.152s">live</a> and on the cable channel as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5573.853s">So</a> that there is something that I'm working on. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5576.736s">I</a> think you all make great points with regard to those commissions as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5581.039s">And</a> the minutes, the agendas for those other commissions would all be in line as well using the software. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5586.784s">So</a> I'm hoping to have a vendor come in soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5589.826s">I'm</a> working on scheduling that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5591.928s">That</a> actually is from a resolution that everyone supported last year as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5596.892s">So</a> I just wanted to give you an update with that since we're on the topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5601.135s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=6060.914s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=6061.815s">Uh,</a> this also came up, uh, last week during the community police meeting and I've received one phone call since, um, with regard to, I guess, uh, many of the people, many of the groups that rent the gym at St. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=6072.702s">Clement's.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=6075.785s">Basically,</a> when they park, I guess they're blocking driveways. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=6078.707s">And,</a> you know, parking too close to driveways, they're blocking driveways and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=6084.571s">So</a> we could just have St. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=6086.032s">Clement's</a> reach out to the people that rent their gymnasiums and just remind them of the parking protocol just to be considerate to the neighbors in the neighborhood.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=832.472s">And</a> so you have not met with the city with regard to this yet?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=841.277s">So</a> if we can find out from the city engineer, if they're going to be requesting curb to curb paving, because I would think that that amount is going to be.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=862.65s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=863.15s">If</a> we could get, but if you could get official word back from a city engineer that it is actual curb to curb and sits, um, sits, uh, you're providing payment in lieu of final trench paving. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=874.498s">If,</a> uh, if say for a year from now, the paving sinks. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=880.102s">So</a> sometimes it sinks, you know, over, over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=883.384s">Are</a> we responsible for that?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=913.497s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=914.218s">Thank</a> you for the clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=915.459s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=916.502s">Councilor</a> Scott Belli.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=2277.602s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=2278.742s">Um,</a> this is, uh, basically, uh, uh, report from, uh, the ad hoc subcommittee on education. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=2286.165s">Uh,</a> we met last week, uh, for the purpose of the meeting was to, uh, review and discuss the university, uh, accountability ordinance, uh, the members, uh, on the sub committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=2296.35s">I'm</a> the chair, uh, uh, also Councilors, uh, Scarpelli and call console Lungo-Koehner on the committee as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=2304.819s">Uh,</a> at the meeting we had city solicitor Mark Brumley, code enforcement officer John Babuso and we had Barbara Rubel and Rocco DeRico from Tufts University. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=2314.621s">Um,</a> and we probably had about 10 to 15 residents from the surrounding neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=2319.202s">Uh,</a> the president, the, um, residents were actually a very happy and pleased with the ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=2326.284s">Uh,</a> they were pleased to, uh, see that something was being done and, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=2330.488s">they</a> felt that, and actually we all felt that this would be a tool that the code enforcement officer, John Babuso could use to help prevent overcrowding and to keep the neighborhoods that surround Tufts University safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=2345.999s">So</a> I looked that we adopt the committee report tonight and move for the first reading.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=2687.85s">The,</a> uh, the, the, the, the, the paper that originally came to our subcommittee, um, basically did not have, uh, that many, we didn't have that many changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=2698.28s">I</a> mean, that, uh, we met a few times, went over the, the language of the city solicitor Romley and, um, the, the residents had a lot of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=2708.71s">Um,</a> you know, and actually one of the things I wanted to point out was, <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=2711.867s">towards</a> the end of the meeting, they were curious as to how our process works here. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=2717.189s">And</a> they asked about, you know, the timing and whatnot, because they want to see something sooner than later. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=2721.29s">And</a> we completely understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=2722.99s">I</a> mean, they live in a neighborhood with a lot of students, and there's a lot of concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=2728.332s">And</a> so we explained to them how it has to go through three readings, and we told them basically how, you know, explained to them how customarily we do not waive the three readings, and we go through that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=2739.991s">And</a> they were completely on board with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=2741.192s">They</a> were fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=2742.452s">They</a> agreed that it should, you know, go through its process and, uh, but they just wanted to see something sooner than later. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=2748.356s">Um,</a> but I think, uh, you know, the changes, one of the big changes was to, uh, that council Longo current had mentioned was, uh, to basically, um, change some of the language on section 26 dash 44. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=2759.282s">Um,</a> and, uh, we did reach out to Tufts to see if they could help us enforce this as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=2766.187s">And,</a> um, <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=2767.29s">And</a> I'll also just ask if the mayor could report back to see if there is a further assistance, um, to, uh, get some help with regard to, uh, an additional code enforcement officer, even if it's someone on a temporary basis to help us go through this process.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=3777.23s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=3777.67s">Councilor</a> Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=3778.431s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=3779.452s">And</a> I want to thank my colleagues for their input because it's very valuable and everyone should definitely give their opinion on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=3786.717s">Um,</a> and it's, it's the ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=3789.82s">I</a> mean, I know myself, I feel like I'm ready to move forward as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=3793.362s">Um,</a> and I understand, um, while there might be some apprehension, it's, it's interesting because it's really, it's a balance between public safety and, you know, having an anonymous list. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=3804.051s">But</a> I did do some research with regard to the cities that also had this type of ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=3810.356s">And</a> if you look at the city of Boston, if you look at the city of Somerville, the language is the same that we have here in this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=3816.321s">And</a> it's basically, you know, if I read the city of Somerville, it's the mayor of the city and the superintendent of office of inspectional services. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=3825.698s">The</a> clerk also shall docket the report and include the docket on the agenda at the next occurring meeting of the Board of Aldermen. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=3832.564s">And</a> it's the same thing for the City of Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=3834.266s">So</a> the language is exactly the same as it is here in the proposed ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=3838.089s">If</a> you want to look at it, I can definitely send it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=3840.992s">And</a> I believe during our meeting, when City Solicitor Rumley spoke, I believe he said, by nature of City Hall, any document that comes in here <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=3853.197s">is</a> public record. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=3854.578s">So</a> that list that comes in is a matter of public record because we're receiving it. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=3859.0s">It's</a> here at city hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=3860.481s">Um,</a> so it's, it, it is what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=3863.643s">It's</a> basically a public document that the public can't access. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=3867.645s">Um,</a> because it's, it's by the nature of what we do here at city hall and it's, it's covered under the public record law. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=3876.17s">So</a> I just wanted to clarify a few things. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=3877.791s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=3878.712s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7r73CCT980&t=3880.273s">Also</a> a knife.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=1745.857s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=1746.838s">I</a> just wanted to thank council Lungo-Koehn for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=1749.76s">Um,</a> this is a very important issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=1751.501s">Uh,</a> development is, uh, an issue that really is affecting every neighborhood throughout this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=1758.425s">No</a> matter where you go, <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=1761.197s">Contractors</a> or developers are coming in and they're trying to build apartments. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=1765.338s">They</a> want all kinds of variances. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=1767.339s">Once</a> again, zoning is a major issue that needs to be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=1770.66s">And,</a> um, you know, it needs to be looked at soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=1773.361s">I</a> mean, sooner than later, because, you know, we haven't looked at it in years. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=1777.523s">Uh,</a> but I mean, as you go from neighborhood to neighborhood, I, down in Wellington, this, uh, 500 units, uh, you go over to Middlesex Ave, it's a few hundred units all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=1786.325s">People</a> want to develop and they want to come in and they want more and more variances. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=1790.247s">Where</a> does it end? <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=1791.271s">It's</a> a quality of life issue because you bring a new development. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=1794.652s">And</a> I agree with the councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=1797.793s">No</a> one's saying we don't want any development, but you want smart development, development that makes sense within the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=1803.575s">If</a> you're overdeveloping, you have all kinds of other issues that come with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=1807.056s">Traffic</a> and traffic related issues are a problem now with the current number of units that we had throughout the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=1813.219s">And</a> you want to add over a thousand more units when you add all these different developments up, you're compounding the problems by the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=1821.373s">This</a> needs to be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=1822.574s">I</a> hope people attend these meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=1824.695s">Um,</a> uh, it's, it's vital that people get involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=1827.256s">It's</a> vital that their voices are heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=1829.677s">Um,</a> these, uh, you know, these, these developments, people think, well, it's just one small development here, one small development there, but as they add up, it becomes a major issue throughout this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=1840.162s">So</a> I support the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=1841.783s">I</a> thank you for bringing it forward.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2745.905s">Exactly,</a> but have we got a date yet on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2749.047s">I'm</a> sorry? <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2749.627s">Have</a> we got a date yet on that meeting?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2751.608s">Okay,</a> if you could please reach out to the administration.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2781.075s">But</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2783.316s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2783.837s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2788.2s">I</a> agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2788.64s">But</a> I, but I also believe that, um, you know, we need to, <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2792.228s">kind</a> of get everybody on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2793.369s">But</a> I honestly feel, I still believe it today, that we need to have someone from the outside take a look at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2798.691s">You</a> are correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/WGXTX-2t8pY&t=2799.732s">Thank</a> you.

href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1171.924s">Uh,</a> but a year ago I offered a similar, similar resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1175.146s">Um,</a> because I believe that the traffic in our community is really having a negative impact on all neighborhoods throughout our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1184.273s">The</a> traffic engineer, in my opinion, is needed now more than ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1187.856s">Uh,</a> the past year I've received like many of my colleagues, uh, many emails, phone calls, just conversations on the street about traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1195.966s">traffic</a> patterns, car crashes, pedestrians being hit by cars, and just pedestrian issues in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1205.23s">These</a> issues could have been addressed by a traffic engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1210.312s">For</a> the past six months, I've worked with the Medford Police Department and Chief Sago on bringing the monthly neighborhood meetings to different sections of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1220.216s">We've</a> had meetings in West Medford at the Brooks School, North Medford at St. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1223.758s">Francis,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1224.639s">down</a> in Wellington at the Andrews Middle School, and most recently here in South Medford at the South Medford Fire Station. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1230.623s">And</a> a common theme has emerged in each of these meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1234.025s">It</a> is basically traffic, traffic congestion, and traffic-related issues, and in general, public safety with regards to traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1241.77s">We</a> have over 57,000 residents, 57 miles of road, 50 miles of sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1246.593s">We</a> have five state roads that cut through our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1249.995s">Route</a> 16, 28, 38, 16, Route 93, <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1253.88s">And</a> on top of that, Route 93 has four off ramps that continuously unload traffic onto our local streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1262.724s">In</a> my discussions with Chief Sacco, he agrees that we need to hire a traffic engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1267.126s">This</a> should be a priority in the next budget, without a doubt. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1271.248s">I</a> give all the credit in the world to Chief Sacco, Sergeant Hartnett, Officer Brooks, for what they've been doing so far to help resolve some of the traffic issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1279.592s">But</a> we don't have anyone in this city <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1283.097s">that</a> basically has the educational background or that has studied traffic or that is a technically a traffic engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1290.703s">And</a> that is what we really need. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1292.545s">And,</a> uh, you know, this traffic is a major problem that's been plaguing our community in the worst is yet to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1298.61s">Uh,</a> you know, methods only seven miles from Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1300.791s">It's</a> a major cut fruit for all surrounding cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1305.115s">It's</a> run a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1305.735s">There</a> are major plans for development. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1308.967s">You</a> know, if you take, for hundreds of units, if you take a look at Rivers Edge, 350 units, Middlesex Ave, 200 units, possibly 500 units on Locust Street, more development on Salem Street and in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1321.512s">I</a> mean, as these developers look to add housing to our neighborhoods, you know, there's no one representing our city with regard to traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1331.097s">The</a> developers come in, and they want to do whatever they want, but we have no one in this city that is qualified to look at traffic and traffic patterns. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1340.363s">We</a> need someone to represent us. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1342.444s">In</a> my opinion, a traffic engineer needs to be added in the upcoming budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1347.107s">Funds</a> need to be appropriated by the mayor, and we must act now. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1352.311s">We</a> can only take a look at what's happening in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1355.012s">We</a> cannot only take a look at what's happening in our city, but we have to take a look at the surrounding cities as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1361.275s">You</a> have possible development at the New England Memorial Hospital in Stoneham. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1365.358s">You</a> have a development in Malden Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1367.959s">You</a> have the casino coming in in Everett. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1370.201s">You</a> have Assembly Row in Somerville that creates traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1372.942s">You</a> have possible development at the Malden Hospital, the old Malden Hospital site up in Malden and North Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1382.588s">And</a> that's going to create possibly 400 to 500 car trips a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1388.633s">I</a> was so concerned about the Malvern hospital issue that, you know, I asked, uh, then, uh, president Dello Russo, if we could set up a, uh, a committee, an ad hoc committee to look at that issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1398.517s">And</a> myself, Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor, uh, uh, Mungo Kern have, uh, have looked at this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1404.76s">And,</a> uh, during our last meeting, we actually, uh, you know, asked that the method police department conduct a study, a traffic study in that area to look at traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1415.245s">They</a> put in a traffic counter for 12 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1418.538s">12</a> days on Murray Hill Road, 33,500 cars in 12 days on Murray Hill Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1427.62s">That</a> tells a story right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1429.921s">This</a> needs to be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1431.641s">Every</a> single neighborhood is experiencing traffic-related issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1437.423s">And</a> if you take a look at what's happening up in that section, it's just a microcosm of what's happening all over the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1444.424s">Traffic</a> is unreal, and it needs to be dealt with, and we need to have someone <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1449.158s">that</a> has the educational background, that went to school, studied traffic, and knows how to deal with these types of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1455.863s">We</a> must act now, our residents deserve better. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1458.625s">This</a> is a public safety issue, it's a quality of life issue, and we need proactive leadership, and that is why I offer this resolution tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1466.391s">I</a> ask Mayor Burke to appropriate the funding for traffic engineer, or have a traffic engineer on retainer included in the fiscal year 2018 budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1475.057s">In</a> addition, I ask my colleagues tonight for the support of this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1479.63s">And,</a> uh, I move approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/HLZVJwxP68w&t=1481.331s">Uh,</a> in addition, I do know that there are some residents that would like to speak on this issue.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3594.452s">Do</a> you know if there are, so the nursing school actually, it's near and dear to my heart. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3599.316s">My</a> wife actually is a graduate from the nursing school. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3601.987s">Yeah,</a> great program, fabulous program, has produced a lot of fine nurses. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=3606.63s">And</a> do you know if there are going to be any changes to that or is that kind of just...

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6462.262s">Let's</a> go back 10 years and he's 27, 27. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6464.743s">And</a> how many, if you don't mind me asking, do you know how many of those are like major, like economic development related?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6496.8s">Because</a> if we could get, if we could go back 20 years, just because I want to see with regard to economic development, what's the impact of these variances? <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6508.082s">What</a> are they, you know, what's being approved? <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6510.242s">I</a> mean, we should be looking at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6513.382s">get</a> 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6514.122s">It'd</a> be great to see the 10 years, but I want to see, I'm assuming a lot of that small stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6518.703s">And</a> if we're talking about economic development, I want to see the big projects that have been approved and then we can look at those and say, okay, what is it been the impact of these use variances that have been approved?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6529.506s">If</a> I could, yes.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Yqa0Po2dZcA&t=6537.908s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=744.646s">I</a> really like the idea of the group space as far as, which I think is, you know, I think so much work done now at school, you know, there's a lot of group study and, you know, there's a lot of group work. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=755.011s">So</a> I think this is a great idea to incorporate this into the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=760.12s">The</a> other thing I also like, too, is, I mean, I like the whole design. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=763.162s">It's</a> really nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=763.882s">It</a> seems like it's really well thought out. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=766.043s">So</a> great job on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=767.344s">As</a> far as the multi-purpose room goes, how many people does that seat? <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=771.606s">And</a> is that suited for giving presentations, all kinds of stuff like that?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=863.688s">As</a> far as the, looking at the plan here, as far as the parking goes, I believe, so are those garages coming down?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=880.637s">12</a> spaces? <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=881.477s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=886.08s">And</a> I'm sorry, back to inside the library, as far as computers, <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=892.657s">technology</a> goes.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=921.207s">I</a> love the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=922.288s">Um,</a> I love the idea of a new library. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=924.409s">Um,</a> you know, I grew up going to the library when I was a kid and back when I was a kid, they had the satellite libraries and we're going to the library in my neighborhood, but it's great to come down here to the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=932.956s">Um,</a> so I love, you know, the location, the designs really nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=936.859s">And,</a> um, you know, I think, uh, this is a huge, a huge investment, but I think it's well worth it. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=942.523s">And,</a> um, you know, I, I think that, you know, if we're going to do it, we have to make sure we do it right. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=947.646s">And,</a> um, you know, and it needs to be ready for, <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=950.232s">you</a> know, future generations of Method residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=952.093s">So,</a> um, I'm really happy about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=953.895s">I</a> supported a hundred percent and I look forward to hopefully we get, hopefully we get that grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=958.258s">We</a> can move forward on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=959.199s">So</a> thank you for all your hard work.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2461.488s">And</a> if I'm correct, are we aiming for silver, the silver level?

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=5517.552s">I</a> think we should move it to subcommittee because I know myself, this is the first time that I'm voting on a license like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=5524.135s">I've</a> never had a vote on a license like this before. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=5526.457s">I</a> think it needs more research. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=5528.417s">I</a> think this may be, I won't speak for all of us, but I think there's a few of us that, <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=5531.983s">have</a> a few questions that need to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=5534.384s">Um,</a> and, uh, by the city solicitor and they haven't been addressed because it was tabled. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=5539.647s">So</a> I think we should move this to subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=5541.348s">So</a> those questions can be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=5543.189s">So</a> when we take future votes, we're all on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=5546.471s">We</a> said, feel like right now, maybe there's some of us that aren't.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=5710.999s">No.</a> 
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=5714.901s">So</a> my reasons are, and I've talked to many residents about this, <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=5719.248s">A</a> business featuring Kino to go may encourage loitering and lingering of patrons inside and outside the licensed premises, leading to further problems and public nuisance of nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=5734.078s">In</a> parking issues were issues as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=5736.34s">So,</a> but I can, those are in a nutshell, some of the issues that I have with the- Thank you for those reasons.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=5902.476s">You</a> are correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=5903.216s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=5903.656s">Next</a> meeting, uh, the, uh, is that on the sixth or the third, the third police community meeting will be held at the South Medford fire station.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=5918.267s">Everyone</a> is welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=5919.188s">No</a> matter what neighbor you neighborhood you're from, everyone is welcome.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6344.163s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6345.363s">Also</a> thank you to Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this forward tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6348.704s">Um,</a> this is definitely a quality of life issue that is going to impact North Medford and Fulton Heights. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6355.825s">Uh,</a> like a Councilor Scarpelli said him, uh, Councilor Longo and myself have been working diligently on the, uh, Malvern hospital ad hoc subcommittee on, uh, the issues, uh, surrounding the Malvern hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6367.687s">This</a> is very similar in nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6369.368s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6370.657s">It's</a> an impact on quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6371.798s">The</a> traffic is going to be out of control. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6375.28s">We're</a> already talking about hundreds of additional trips from Malden Hospital, potentially, and you're talking about, I mean, many, many more than that, I believe, up at the old New England Memorial site in Stoneham. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6387.767s">So</a> this is a major concern, a major quality of life issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6393.31s">So</a> far, with regard to the research that we've done in the Malden Hospital, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6398.899s">had</a> Sergeant Hartnett and Officer Brooks go out and do traffic counts on Murray Hill Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6403.82s">We'll</a> be getting that report soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6406.201s">So</a> what I'd like to do is if Councilor Scarpelli wouldn't mind, I'd like to amend the resolution that we get traffic counts on Highland Avenue, Elm Street, and on Fulton Street in the interest of public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6419.064s">We</a> need to be proactive with regard to this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6423.365s">Like</a> Councilor Scarpelli said, this is a major quality of life issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6427.691s">We</a> need to be out in front of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6429.531s">And</a> in talking to Sergeant Hartnett, we cannot get traffic counts. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6434.353s">We're</a> not gonna be able to get them soon because of the weather. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6437.053s">I</a> guess the traffic counting machine doesn't work well in inclement weather and in the winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6440.954s">So</a> probably in the spring, we will be able to get those counts. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6444.695s">But</a> I'd like to amend the resolution that we get traffic counts on Highland Ave, Elm Street and Fulton Street in the interest of public safety.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7346.009s">I</a> think it's a good resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7347.009s">I</a> think it makes fiscal sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7349.25s">I</a> think it, I think it's a good resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7351.431s">I</a> think it makes good fiscal sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7353.832s">And</a> I have, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7355.577s">I</a> have no problem with it going to subcommittee, but I think it would be nice to actually get a draft policy first that would come to subcommittee and then we can discuss it because then we'll have something to work with. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7366.827s">So</a> I'd like to, I'd like to see a draft, you know, Paul, I think if we pass this, have it, or maybe it's amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7372.692s">So</a> it's a draft policy that comes to us with a plan and then we can meet in subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7378.477s">And</a> I mean, I've, uh, you know, I've only been on the board for years, years. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7382.06s">So,</a> um, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7382.934s">I'm</a> on this subcommittee and, you know, I'd be more than happy to take a look at it with my, I believe Councilor Caraviello and Councilor Marks around this.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7407.116s">So,</a> I think it, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7410.382s">So</a> Mr. President, I think it makes sense to actually move this to subcommittee, but I think it would make more sense to have a draft policy come to us with the administration, how they would like to handle it, and what they would like the policy to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7424.327s">We</a> can review it and vet it, and at that point make a decision, OK, do we want changes to this? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7428.969s">Does</a> this make sense? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7430.45s">Or</a> is it something we can live with? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7432.21s">Or</a> maybe it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7434.051s">But</a> I think that we need to have something to work with. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7437.772s">We</a> need to get something from the administration first.<h2><a href="../2016-12-09_glKA7NZ6z0Q/2016-12-09_glKA7NZ6z0Q.html">Medford, MA City Council - Dec. 6, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=2753.336s">I</a> received a calls from a number of residents on Tainter Street and Fulton Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=2758.069s">Um,</a> when you come out of tainter and you're heading towards Fulton, uh, you cannot take a left. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=2762.891s">And</a> I guess increasingly, uh, you have, there are cars that are taking that left and going down Fulton street the wrong way. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=2770.314s">Um,</a> which is very dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=2771.495s">It's</a> a very narrow street, but the no left turn sign is on a telephone pole that is to the right and it's really high and it's being, it's being blocked by a tree that's in a private property. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=2785.601s">So</a> if good at the signs, the lower, <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=2788.052s">uh,</a> in the interest of public safety, uh, just, I just want to try to prevent an accident there. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=2792.874s">It's</a> can be very dangerous intersection, especially after school when you have Roberts kids, uh, walking home, uh, kids that live in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=2799.976s">So</a> if we could just have, uh, the DPW lower those signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=2803.137s">So</a> they're in a, uh, view of the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=2806.237s">That'd</a> be great.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=4535.754s">Is</a> there any, I guess, type of hazard to anyone just being in the vicinity? <a href="https://youtu.be/glKA7NZ6z0Q&t=4542.578s">Or</a> is it just as long as the parking lot's shut down, we're fine?

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2768.428s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2769.328s">Uh,</a> this issue came up as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2770.669s">Uh,</a> this is an ongoing issue at the Roberts elementary school. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2773.55s">It</a> was corrected a few years ago with the help of the police department and active parents in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2778.711s">And,</a> uh, they put a system in place where they had, uh, actually soft horses that they put in the street to, uh, uh, stop some of the traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2785.914s">And,</a> uh, since the, over the past year or so, the soft horses have now been removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2791.115s">I</a> think they're using cones, but it's not as efficient as it was in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2794.957s">And</a> it seems that, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2796.758s">there</a> are a lot of new parents as well that are driving through the parking lot when they shouldn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2801.14s">And</a> it's a, once again, this is one of the most populated schools in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2806.462s">It's</a> a public safety issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2807.903s">Um,</a> you know, a lot of, uh, young kids are in that area and, uh, it needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2812.845s">And</a> furthermore, it needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2814.365s">The</a> communication needs to go out to the parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2816.646s">I</a> don't think communication has gone out this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2818.487s">Uh,</a> it should go out. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2820.048s">Um,</a> it actually needs to be communication should be set to the residents in the neighborhood as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2824.91s">So</a> they know, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2825.837s">what</a> streets they can access and what streets they cannot access during pickup and drop off. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=2830.899s">So</a> I thank you for your time and I move approval.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3138.879s">Well,</a> the driver, let me, let me, I guess, be clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3141.56s">This,</a> this is, well, it came up during the community meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3145.571s">And</a> it's basically as the buses go from one route to the next. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3149.914s">So,</a> you know, the conclusion of the route, they're flying to get to the next route. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3154.858s">So</a> there's no one, we don't have students on the bus at that time, but still they should be adhering to this local speed limits that are in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3163.525s">And</a> it sounds like they're not, I got a number of complaints about this from residents and it came up at the meeting as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3169.99s">So</a> I just wanted to have either the police chief or the superintendent of schools reach out to Eastern bus, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3175.021s">and</a> just to remind their drivers to drive safely at all times. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3179.722s">Very</a> good.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3725.811s">Councilor</a> Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3726.592s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3727.612s">Uh,</a> the reverse time one, uh, nine one one system is a valuable tool that we use in the community for, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3734.427s">different</a> events that we, you know, usually, usually use to, um, spread word, you know, about different events that are coming up in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3741.689s">And,</a> um, uh, there were a few people that I mentioned at the community, community police meeting, um, that, you know, it'd be good to actually have some more neighborhood focused type messages with regard to anything that's happening with regard to like crime or that type of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3756.174s">So</a> if you have a number of break-ins in the neighborhood or, or, you know, you know, car break-ins, <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3760.743s">you</a> know, it'd be nice to actually isolate the messages to specific neighborhoods to say, you know, keep an eye out. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3766.446s">Um,</a> you know, uh, your neighborhood, there's various issues going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3771.008s">So</a> if we could just start to use the 911 reverse 911 system in a way that's neighborhood specific, uh, I think that'd be very beneficial to each neighborhood throughout a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3782.134s">So</a> move approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3783.255s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3813.312s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3814.213s">I</a> received a number of phone calls about this issue here near the Winthrop Street Rotary, which we've talked about on many occasions over the past month with regard to traffic and safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3824.84s">There</a> is a crosswalk at the intersection of Essex and High Street and near Schoolhouse Road as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3833.686s">There's</a> a crosswalk that's in that area that's extremely dangerous to cross at. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3838.37s">So</a> if we could put up some pedestrian signs just to illustrate to drivers just <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3843.349s">just</a> to bring some more attention to it, that it's a place where people do cross, there's a school nearby, there's a lot of traffic in that area with regard to basically five roads coming into one area. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3855.378s">So</a> if we could put up those pedestrian signs, I think it'd be just a great way to help out with public safety at that intersection. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=3865.044s">So</a> move approval, thank you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4007.087s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4008.227s">I</a> understand the concern of my fellow colleagues <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4011.222s">but</a> the bottom line is there's a crosswalk there and it's a safety issue and the sign should go up until it's determined by the traffic commission to take them, to take them down or to eliminate the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4023.109s">We</a> want to keep our pedestrians safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4025.21s">Putting</a> up signs is a low cost option and if we don't use them there and they're taken down, I'm sure we can use them at some other crosswalk in the, in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4033.976s">So</a> I mean in the time being, for the time being it should be about public safety and making sure that the residents of our community is safe crossing the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4041.772s">If</a> it should come down, I'm fine with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4043.833s">If</a> the crosswalk should be eliminated and the traffic commission decides to do that, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4048.795s">But</a> in the meantime, it's about keeping the residents of our community safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4052.417s">So</a> I, I, uh, I believe the sign should go up as soon as possible.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4088.886s">If</a> I may, could we read back the amendments just because it sounds like it's contradictory now. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4094.569s">I</a> feel like it's,
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4130.236s">I</a> think contradictory in nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4134.281s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4134.561s">We're</a> asking, well, I'm asking for signs to be put up and my colleagues asking, which is right.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=4159.945s">I</a> would actually like, if Council and I wouldn't mind putting it in as a separate resolution, because to me it seems contradictory.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7232.645s">Mr.</a> Councilor, how'd you find those records? <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7234.486s">Mr.</a> President, I asked that those records be tabled. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7237.167s">I</a> actually did not receive a copy. <a href="https://youtu.be/A7FOhb4GQOs&t=7239.547s">in</a> my package.<h2><a href="../2016-11-04_pK_zTCVRveY/2016-11-04_pK_zTCVRveY.html">Medford, MA City Council - Nov. 1, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=2275.246s">It's</a> a very busy intersection. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=2276.628s">A</a> lot of people cross that intersection in the morning, walk across there to catch the bus to go into Boston, or to go to Wellington Station. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=2284.055s">Some</a> kids cross to get to baseball in the summer and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=2291.052s">have</a> someone contact the DCR to increase the time to cross the street, the walking signals. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=2296.733s">I</a> greatly appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=2297.534s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=2298.494s">On</a> the motion for approval by Councilor Falco, Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2923.985s">That</a> meeting was not geared specifically towards the West Medford neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2930.448s">I</a> made it entirely clear that it was geared to everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2934.29s">We're</a> bringing the meeting to each neighborhood throughout the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2937.992s">Well,</a> that's not the intention. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2938.732s">Excuse</a> me. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2939.473s">Anyone</a> can come, and anyone can talk about any problem they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2944.135s">There</a> were people there that were not from West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2946.196s">They</a> were from Wellington. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2947.417s">And</a> they talked about issues that they had. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2949.378s">So</a> it wasn't specifically about West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2953.073s">I</a> mean, it was heavily involved with West Bedford questions about specific issues that were happening in that neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2963.718s">I</a> mean, so the whole point of the thing is to <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2968.198s">is</a> to bring the meetings to the neighborhoods and actually make it easily accessible for people to get to those meetings, which I think we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2974.739s">We</a> had 70 to 75, with all the police there too, I think probably close to 100 people in the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2979.12s">And</a> normally, and Bob, you would know this better than anyone, there's probably maybe 10 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2983.441s">I'm</a> not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2984.201s">There's</a> not that many people there on a monthly basis down at the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2988.422s">So</a> anyone could come to that meeting, and anyone could talk about any issue that they wanted to. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2993.243s">The</a> chief made that entirely clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2995.384s">The</a> meeting happened to be in West Method next month. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2998.165s">It'll</a> be at St. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2999.285s">Francis</a> Parish Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3001.006s">A</a> month after that, it's going to be at the Andrews Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3004.127s">Anyone</a> and everyone is welcome to attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3006.967s">The</a> more people that attend, the better. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3008.608s">That's</a> what this is all about, getting people involved, engaging the residents, and having them come to the meeting and talk about the things that affect them in their neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3017.41s">But</a> it's not limited, no meeting is ever limited to just these residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3021.511s">Everybody</a> and anybody can come. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3023.312s">I</a> hope everybody comes. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3024.552s">I</a> mean, we have big areas, big, <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3027.696s">I</a> mean, the schools, St. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3028.876s">Francis</a> Parish Center, South Medford Fire Station, these are all big venues where we can see lots of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3034.438s">So</a> I'd love to fill the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3036.259s">I</a> mean, but I mean, everyone, and let me repeat this, everyone is welcome to come and talk about anything they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3043.421s">The</a> chief was, when he came and he opened up the meeting, he said that, you know, any questions, feel free to ask, we're here to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3049.623s">And</a> I thought it was a very good exchange, very good dialogue back and forth between the residents and the police. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3056.246s">And</a> I thought it was very productive. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3057.607s">I</a> mean, you know, Council Marks just went through the plan that they're working on and I think it's a good start. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3063.773s">Now,</a> is it gonna solve the problem completely? <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3066.415s">Maybe</a> not, but it's a good start. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3070.318s">But</a> I think, you know, I just wanna just make clear that that meeting, it didn't really start on Facebook. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3076.443s">That</a> meeting was a resolution that I brought forward earlier in the year, back in the spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3081.483s">to</a> basically bring these meetings out into the neighborhood, engage the residents, have them talk about what is going on in their neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3089.151s">So</a> I just want to make that clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3090.833s">So</a> thank you, Mr. President.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3893.006s">Uh,</a> and I apologize if this sounds a little repetitive. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3895.687s">Um,</a> but, uh, a few months ago I offered a resolution to bring the, uh, monthly meetings at the Medford police station into the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3902.752s">Our</a> first one was last Wednesday at the Brooke school. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3906.594s">And,</a> uh, first of all, I'd like to thank chief Sacco for letting me bring those into the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3911.853s">I'd</a> also like to thank DPW Commissioner Brian Kerins. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3915.035s">He</a> was there as well and he did a great job at outlining the improvements that they're going to be putting in place in front of the Brooks Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3924.339s">And</a> also like to thank my colleagues as well, Councilor Marks and Councilor Caraviello were there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3930.041s">And</a> it was a nice meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3930.642s">It</a> was a good meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3931.722s">It</a> was a nice healthy exchange of ideas and possible solutions to what we can do in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3938.267s">There's</a> about 75 to 100 residents, many members of the Medford Police Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3943.851s">And</a> we talked about traffic, but we also talked about other issues, school safety, speeding, lighting was an issue, signage throughout the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3954.657s">But</a> as we had mentioned earlier, over the past few months, there have been two people that have been hit by cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3961.802s">I</a> believe there was a car accident on the corner of Mystic and High Street within the past couple of weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3967.65s">So</a> there are major problems in that area with regard to traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3971.653s">I</a> mean, you go from Medford Square down to St. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3974.575s">Ray's,</a> as was mentioned earlier, it's a straight shot, and there's absolutely no lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3979.398s">So</a> what we need to do is, it's kind of like a multi-pronged approach where we need to make improvements to that area, but one of the things we need to do is lower the speed limit. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3988.504s">Actually,</a> at the meeting, Representative Garbally was there as well, and he talked about, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=3997.063s">and</a> the chief did as well, about how it's a state road. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4000.646s">And</a> we really have limits as to what we can do regarding state roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4004.389s">And</a> one of the suggestions was to lower the speed limit to 25 miles per hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4009.573s">And</a> I think a lot of people are in favor of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4013.056s">We're</a> talking about pedestrians, bicyclists, that are just trying to get from point A to point B, and it's become very dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4023.887s">Representative</a> Garboly had encouraged residents to actually write letters to Stephanie Pollack, the director of the MassDOT. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4035.695s">And</a> I think what we should do here is we should actually be part of this effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4040.298s">And</a> we should stand behind our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4043.1s">And</a> we should go on record as writing a letter to Stephanie Pollack as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4048.263s">And</a> I think this is an issue that we can all unite behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4052.847s">uh,</a> in the best interest of many residents throughout this community and the people that pass through our community, that we take public safety serious, that we want to make sure that everyone is safe, getting to where they need to get to. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4063.054s">And</a> I think 25 miles per hour will be appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4066.256s">Um,</a> and, uh, uh, you know, I'm hoping that my councils, uh, support this resolution tonight and, uh, move approval on the motion for approval by councilor Falco chair recognizes councilor night.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4343.137s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4344.958s">So</a> these resolutions, these three resolutions, the one that I offered earlier and these upcoming resolutions, and these are all from <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4353.277s">basically</a> the product of the meeting that we had the other night. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4356.158s">And,</a> um, you know, I received many calls from residents, uh, from in particular for middle school, uh, parents that have kids that need to catch the bus in the morning and they just have a tough time navigating high street. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4371.28s">We've</a> been talking about it for the past, probably half an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4374.821s">Um,</a> it's tough to cross. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4376.381s">And,</a> uh, I'd like to see, um, if we could, uh, add another, <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4380.582s">crossing</a> guard during the, we already have one during the elementary hours, but it'd be nice to have one, uh, for the middle school students as well when they, um, get ready to go to school in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4389.666s">So</a> if we could add a crossing guard to that, uh, intersection, um, that'd be great.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4484.494s">And</a> another, uh, so, so this is, um, this resolution here is basically to add a crossing guard. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4491.398s">What,</a> one of the things that they're actually looking at is actually placing the bus stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4496.482s">So,</a> so what they've done, and I know this came up earlier from what I've been told is on the fellows way, officer Brooks worked, uh, the bus route, reworked the bus route. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4505.328s">So</a> no one has to cross the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4507.805s">So</a> all the stops are on one side of high and the stops on the other side of high. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4511.746s">So</a> I think they're working through that now trying to readjust that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4514.367s">So</a> this is kind of a stop gap measure until we get that resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4518.948s">From</a> what I've been told, Officer Brooks has worked with the schools to actually look at those way bus stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4527.11s">And</a> I believe they've already done that where they have stops on one side and stops on the other side. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4531.371s">So</a> no one actually has to cross. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4533.531s">So</a> there's just a little piece of information for my colleagues.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4566.814s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4569.195s">Like</a> I mentioned earlier, during the monthly community meeting, this came up as well, the Winthrop Street Rotary. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4574.177s">You</a> know, the Rotary is definitely a public safety concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4579.119s">Over</a> the past few years, there have been many accidents at that Rotary on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4585.742s">You</a> know, you have five streets that run right into that one Rotary. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4590.144s">And</a> years ago, when there were probably fewer cars on the road, maybe this made sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4595.42s">But</a> these days, the days that we live in, everyone owns a car. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4601.141s">And</a> some houses have three, four, five cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4605.703s">This</a> is a major concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4606.783s">I</a> mean, we have all kinds of traffic coming in from Methodist residents, from residents in Winchester, Estonia. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4614.545s">I</a> mean, you name it, all surrounding communities that are coming through this one area. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4618.486s">The</a> traffic is really bad in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4620.206s">I've</a> received calls on this as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4623.088s">The</a> cars are backed up on Winthrop Street, High Street, you name it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4627.149s">And</a> it's a major concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4629.29s">I</a> think in the matter, just looking at public safety, this is something that the city needs to address. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4636.292s">I'd</a> like to see them have some sort of a study to look at this intersection. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4640.113s">I</a> think the chief had mentioned that the way it presently is today, it's just not good. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4646.755s">I</a> mean, this is not good for the community to have a rotary like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4652.315s">roads</a> flowing in. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4653.616s">So</a> I'd like to have the city have a study that actually looks at that intersection and making it into a regular intersection with streetlights. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4665.401s">You</a> know, just research it, study it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4667.642s">It's</a> just a matter of public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4669.263s">We</a> need to make sure that people are safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4670.883s">This</a> is a major safety concern and I move approval.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4920.324s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4921.345s">I</a> am definitely in favor of the amendments. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4924.828s">No</a> problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4925.488s">I</a> mean, we need to be flexible. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4926.87s">So</a> the bottom line for me is it just needs to be studied. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4932.114s">We</a> need to take a look at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4933.657s">It's</a> a matter of public safety, so I'm fine with the amendments, and I thank my colleagues for bringing them forward.<h2><a href="../2025-03-18_2SyhnAlrcqY/2025-03-18_2SyhnAlrcqY.html">Medford, MA City Council - Oct. 4, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=2886.964s">I</a> was stopped by a resident on the way in tonight that would like to address the council.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=2895.448s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=4657.402s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=4658.623s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Moki, for your report. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=4661.344s">I,</a> too, am very happy to see this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=4665.467s">Very</a> happy to see it getting started. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=4667.328s">This</a> is, for many people that don't live here, they might come here to do business. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=4672.211s">And</a> a lot of people, of course, that live here come here to do business. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=4674.292s">And</a> it sends a message how we treat this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=4677.835s">It</a> sends a message to the community about what we're about. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=4683.302s">Quick</a> question about the parapet up top. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=4685.103s">So</a> is that going to basically, when it's replaced, is it going to look the same?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=4728.151s">And</a> as far as, right now I believe, <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=4731.318s">with</a> the type of material right now is concrete that's up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=4734.799s">Is</a> that going to be concrete or is that going to be another material?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=4767.749s">And</a> I assume that the polyvinyl probably holds up longer and more weather-resistant?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6231.913s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6232.994s">I</a> just want to also state, I think this is a project where time is of the essence. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6237.098s">It</a> needs to be done right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6238.139s">I</a> think back to the winter where <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6241.695s">walking</a> into the building, I felt like the ceiling was kind of like a sieve. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6244.317s">I</a> mean, the water was just coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6246.439s">It</a> needs to be repaired as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6248.32s">And</a> I also would like to see this approved tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6251.423s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6404.051s">I</a> also would like to just to make a quick announcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6406.292s">Um,</a> and that was that back in the spring, I offered a resolution to bring the monthly community police meetings, uh, into the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6413.916s">And,</a> uh, I've been working on that and, uh, happy to say that we have a few dates coming up where we're actually going to be bringing the community, uh, police meetings <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6422.28s">into</a> the various neighborhoods throughout our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6424.501s">So</a> therefore people can go to their, uh, just stay in the neighborhood and go to the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6428.422s">So</a> we're bringing the meeting to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6430.423s">Um,</a> so yep. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6432.283s">Let's</a> see. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6432.583s">The</a> first meeting is going to be October 5th at the Brooke school. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6437.485s">Uh,</a> the second meeting will be November 2nd at St. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6441.206s">Francis.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6442.467s">The</a> third meeting will be on December 7th at the Andrews school. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6447.153s">and</a> the fourth meeting will be in South Medford, I believe on January 4th, but I just have to confirm that, but I just wanted to let everybody know that those community meetings have been set up. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6457.239s">I</a> talked with the chief about that as well, so we're always looking forward to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6461.582s">They</a> all start at 7 p.m., and if anyone has any questions, feel free to give me a call, I'll be more than happy to answer any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6469.186s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7539.554s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7541.515s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7543.497s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7545.058s">I</a> received a number of calls from the residents on Russell Street regarding the guardrail that it's basically on Russell Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7553.384s">And</a> it stands between Russell Street and Crane Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7556.446s">And</a> it's been in disrepair for quite some time now. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7559.949s">And</a> it's also overgrown with lots of brush, and weeds, and trees, and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7564.532s">And</a> it's definitely a public safety concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7569.119s">I</a> have a picture of it here if anybody wants to see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7571.3s">And</a> it's really tough to, if anybody had any type of disability wanted to get by in a wheelchair, it'd be really tough to navigate. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7579.885s">It's</a> really overgrown. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7581.346s">The</a> guide rail is in complete disrepair. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7583.827s">It</a> needs to be replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7585.268s">And</a> I'd like to see it replaced as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7588.47s">And</a> if possible, at least if we could start by getting the DPW to trim the weeds and trim it back a bit just so people can, <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7598.023s">traverse</a> that sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7599.624s">So</a> I'd like to make a motion to have this approved and actually if we could have the guide rail replaced and if we could have the DPW in the meantime before its replacement, if we could have them clean up the area, I'd greatly appreciate it.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7613.71s">Aye.</a> 
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7638.536s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7640.217s">This</a> here is an issue that <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7643.487s">impacts</a> or has a negative effect on all of our communities, all of our neighborhoods throughout the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7648.85s">As</a> you drive around, you see graffiti, tagging on a lot of commercial property, it seems like. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7656.314s">And</a> as I did some research, I found that there's penalties and fines for the person that actually tags the property, but there's no, we have nothing in the ordinance to actually <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7671.604s">have</a> the graffiti removed by the property owner. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7674.365s">And</a> it's unfortunate, but I mean, Councilor Caraviello had a great resolution earlier in the year where, you know, the Bigelow building on Forest Street, and that's a gateway to our square. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7685.989s">You</a> come down Forest Street, you know, if you go to a show at the Chevalier or you're heading to Method Square, what do you see? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7691.371s">The</a> building on the left and graffiti all over the side of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7695.301s">It's</a> been there for months and there's no teeth in the ordinance to actually have it cleaned. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7700.986s">So</a> we can send out the code enforcement officer, but he really can't do anything about it because there's no teeth. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7706.89s">There's</a> no fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7707.591s">There's</a> nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7708.852s">So,</a> um, I really feel that, you know, something needs to be done about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7712.855s">I</a> think, you know, maybe this paper goes into subcommittee where we research it and see what they do in other cities and towns, but something needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7719.841s">Uh,</a> you know, all over the city, I see graffiti and tagging and there's really, <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7724.886s">There's</a> nothing being done about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7726.466s">And</a> I think something needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7728.407s">It</a> sends a message to people when they come to our community and they see this, they say, what's going on here? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7733.148s">I</a> mean, there's graffiti everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7734.808s">And</a> I think it really sends a message. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7737.008s">And</a> the thing with graffiti and tagging, if you don't take it down right away, it gets worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7741.569s">And</a> people add to it and it just multiplies and it gets out of control. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7745.23s">And</a> I feel like we're at a point now where, you know, you go to each corner of the city, there are buildings that have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7751.015s">And</a> something needs to be done about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7752.536s">So</a> I'd like to offer this resolution, and I'd hope that everyone would support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7758.399s">And</a> I think that going to subcommittee is probably the proper approach to take, because I think we should research it with other cities and towns to see what other cities and towns do, just to make sure that we're doing the right thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7771.086s">but</a> I would like the council's support on this, so thank you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8254.609s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8257.024s">I</a> thank my council colleagues for their suggestions because I think, you know, this at least starts the discussion as to what we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8264.029s">I</a> think some great suggestions came from Councilor Knight, Councilor Marks, Councilor Caraviello with regard to actually maybe bringing on a team or having a department that does that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8272.355s">And</a> I think maybe incorporated with some teeth if someone refuses, you know, that's something we can look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8276.898s">But</a> the discussion begins and I think that's the important piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8280.08s">And</a> I just want to thank my colleagues for their support. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8282.802s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8434.48s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8435.72s">This</a> is an issue that came up right around budget time. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8439.041s">And</a> it's something that I believe in. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8441.642s">It's</a> something that, you know, it's one of our most important responsibilities is to pass the city budget each year. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8448.424s">This</a> year, we're in the range of $162 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8450.625s">And,</a> you know, but the budget process shouldn't be just in May and June. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8456.787s">It</a> should be continuous throughout the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8458.227s">We</a> should know what's going on with the individual accounts, you know, where we stand, you know, after X amount of months. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8464.574s">So</a> the request is basically to get budget to actual details. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8469.016s">I</a> had asked for this in a previous meeting, and the administration said we were going to get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8474.679s">We</a> haven't received it yet, but I did talk to, I said the chief of staff when I came into the meeting tonight, she told me that we will have it at the next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8483.104s">But</a> I think it's important, you know, one of our most important responsibilities is the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8488.447s">The</a> budget should be an ongoing process where we're looking at it each month to see where we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8493.417s">So</a> I think that it's important to us that we keep an eye on the numbers each month and move for approval.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10565.605s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10567.286s">And</a> I just want to say I agree with my council colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10570.065s">You</a> know, zoning is one of our most important responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10573.248s">It</a> needs to be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10574.368s">It</a> needs to be looked at sooner than later. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10576.11s">You</a> know, we, it seems like, you know, month after month, we keep hearing about developers that want to come in and build and build and build, and they're seeking all kinds of variances. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10586.758s">And,</a> you know, so we need to jump on top of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10589.58s">And</a> Council Member Mox is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10590.561s">This</a> is one of our most important responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10592.943s">And</a> we have to get on top of this sooner than later. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10595.285s">And</a> it's correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10597.647s">Zoning</a> has not been looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10599.798s">in</a> this city for close to probably, I mean, with the exception of the stations landing area, I talked to someone the other day and they said it was probably close to 40, if not 50 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10608.72s">I</a> mean, it has been a very long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10611.18s">If</a> you take a look at the zoning maps, they're very dated. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10614.06s">It</a> needs to be looked at and it needs to be looked at now. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10616.981s">So</a> I just wanna go on the record of saying, you know, I support my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10620.182s">I</a> think this is something we need to look at sooner than later. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10623.302s">And,</a> you know, I look forward to working with the subcommittee that's gonna work on that, the zoning subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10629.465s">Hopefully</a> we will be looking at that soon.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11469.432s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11470.212s">I'd</a> like to thank you, Councilor Knight, for bringing this forward tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11474.754s">This</a> year, I support wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11477.495s">It</a> makes complete sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11479.275s">Smoking</a> is so dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11480.696s">It's</a> amazing when, back in my years in the school committee, we would get yearly reports about, you know, tobacco trends and alcohol trends and drug trends and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11489.859s">And,</a> you know, it's so hard to believe, even knowing the dangers of cigarettes, that, you know, young people would still smoke. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11497.595s">But</a> I support this 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11499.116s">I</a> thank you for a council night for bringing it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11501.758s">This</a> is a great resolution and I'm happy he brought it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11505.881s">So</a> thank you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_81H3OXzw2Ec/2025-03-21_81H3OXzw2Ec.html">Medford, MA City Council - July 19, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=2576.797s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=2578.017s">Um,</a> I am too also very pleased that we're heading in the right direction with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=2582.538s">It's</a> been a far too long. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=2584.499s">I'm</a> glad to see that we're moving forward and hopefully this, uh, project will come to fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=2589.661s">As</a> far as, and I know this is looking kind of further down the road, but you had mentioned that construction could take up to 18 months if things go as planned. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=2599.608s">Have</a> you given any thought to what would happen to the library during those 18 months and maybe where it would be?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=2643.551s">It's</a> just a concern, because I know that there's <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=2646.134s">You</a> have a ton of books, computers, employees, and a lot of people use the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=2653.796s">It's</a> a great resource. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=2656.056s">It's</a> a great building. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=2656.757s">It's</a> a great community resource. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=2658.917s">And</a> that was just my concern, is that 18 months, a year and a half, that's a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=2664.259s">And</a> I just want to make sure that that service is still there for the residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=2669.48s">I</a> know it will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=2670.641s">but</a> it'll be interesting to hear what the long range plan is.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=7893.788s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=7895.948s">First</a> of all, thank you to City Solicitor Romley for putting this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=7898.469s">And</a> thank you, Mr. Hogan, for being here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=7902.069s">I</a> am a dog owner. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=7902.95s">I</a> love my dog. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=7903.99s">And,</a> you know, he's a big part of our family. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=7908.031s">And</a> I've received many calls both for and against. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=7912.751s">And,</a> you know, and Councilor Marks brings up a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=7916.832s">There's</a> almost a need for dog parks in different areas throughout our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=7923.175s">There's</a> a demand for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=7925.336s">It</a> was interesting to get this tonight because actually a lot of the questions that it got from people that were concerned were, is there going to be a fence? <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=7934.539s">And</a> I was under the assumption that there was no fence. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=7936.94s">I'm</a> happy that they're suggesting a fence. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=7940.621s">Do</a> we know anything about if this passes the fence, what type of fence, how long it'll take to implement this as far as actually getting a temporary fence set up?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=7983.267s">As</a> far as the, um, and I know you said earlier that, you know, uh, because a lot of, a lot of the questions I'm getting is who's going to monitor this. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=7991.529s">Is</a> anyone going to monitor this? <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=7993.109s">And</a> I, and I know you said, you know, you, you, you're going to be at the park as much as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=7996.85s">And</a> I know you work a full day. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=7998.67s">Um,</a> so right now, do you have specific hours as far as your current regular hours is supposed to be 830 to 430, 830 to 430.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=8008.996s">I'm</a> sorry? <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=8009.516s">But</a> I'm also called in on emergencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=8010.816s">OK,</a> yeah, I would imagine. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=8011.617s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=8012.597s">So</a> as far as, because a lot of the calls I'm getting are from people saying, you know, is someone going to be there to, you know, what if something goes wrong? <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=8020.521s">What</a> if a dog needs to be removed? <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=8022.522s">Who's</a> going to remove the dog? <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=8023.963s">You</a> know, I mean, if you're not there, you know, it's impossible to be there all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=8030.125s">You</a> know, are they going to have to call the police? <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=8031.926s">Is</a> that something the police is going to have to do?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=8036.232s">And</a> I think people are concerned about that, too, as far as should the police really be diving into monitoring a dog park. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=8045.494s">And</a> so there are concerns there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=8048.654s">As</a> far as a well-behaved dog is a dog that has a valid license. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=8054.995s">Makes</a> sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=8055.795s">But</a> as far as if there's no one there constantly monitoring the dog, it could be anyone showing up with a dog, just letting him run wild. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=8063.377s">So</a> I think a lot of the calls that I've gotten <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=8066.764s">from</a> concerned residents saying, you know, is there any type of monitoring at all? <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=8072.148s">It</a> sounds like there might be some, but not, you know, on a regular—not on a—every night from 6 to 8, there's going to be someone there opening up, locking up, that type of thing.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=8099.031s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=8099.691s">That's</a> good to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=8100.232s">I</a> mean, I definitely support the dog park that's going to go beyond the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=8105.515s">I</a> think it's a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=8107.256s">I</a> can't wait to see it happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=8109.337s">But</a> I just have some concerns from people that have called me. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=8113.559s">With</a> regard to <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=8115.47s">In</a> the ordinance, there are conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=8118.051s">There</a> are about 11 conditions here. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=8119.331s">Are</a> those conditions going to be posted at the park? <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=8124.573s">To</a> me, it makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=8125.213s">There'll</a> be some sort of signage that there'll be expectations.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=8147.018s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=8158.021s">That's</a> it for now. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=8159.962s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=12234.867s">I'll</a> make it quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=12235.688s">Um,</a> if we could, uh, also just amend the resolution to just get a report back from, uh, Mike Nestor with regard to parks and park maintenance and just to see what the impact will be as far as, uh, his concerns.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=13059.802s">take</a> a paper from the table.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=13114.457s">I'd</a> like to make a motion to approve.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=13177.799s">That's</a> basically, I mean, it was, it was basically tabled. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=13181.261s">Um,</a> I know I, I was prepared to vote that night, but it was tabled. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=13184.304s">I</a> think to give everyone an opportunity to look into it further. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=13187.546s">Um,</a> it's, uh, it's, it's been over a month now. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=13191.268s">Um,</a> I think, you know, if we vote for it or against it, you know, that, that's what we get paid to do to make votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=13196.292s">And,</a> um, you know, I, I know I'm prepared to vote for it tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=13200.075s">Um,</a> I know, uh, Alicia hunts here. <a href="https://youtu.be/81H3OXzw2Ec&t=13202.945s">She</a> could probably answer if there are any unanswered questions, but I think it's something that we need to move upon.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_L9vF4yM-fUc/2025-03-21_L9vF4yM-fUc.html">Medford, MA City Council - June 28, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1343.025s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1344.286s">I</a> also support this resolution 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1348.93s">I</a> have received a number of calls over the past couple of weeks throughout the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1354.333s">Down</a> on Park Street over in West Medford, I've received calls as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1358.875s">I</a> live in the Heights as well, and I just walk out into my backyard, and there's a plane flying over. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1363.358s">And</a> they're flying low, and it's like every minute and a half, they're flying over the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1367.08s">And</a> it's just, it is continuous. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1369.481s">So</a> it's definitely a major problem that impacts almost every neighborhood in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1376.305s">And</a> it's really a- <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1379.872s">We're</a> fine in South Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1382.973s">That's</a> not what I hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1383.713s">But</a> I mean, from what I hear, they're coming right over. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1385.893s">I</a> was at Harvard Street, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1389.594s">But</a> it's an issue that affects every neighborhood in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1393.415s">And</a> it really impacts the quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1395.795s">So</a> it's definitely something I support. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1398.056s">I</a> know there is a noise hotline that people can call. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1400.757s">And</a> Massport does keep track of the people that do call. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1405.017s">So</a> I think it's important that people call. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1408.12s">561-3333,</a> and it's staffed by Massport employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1413.765s">And</a> it's definitely something that I think the more people that call, the better. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1418.188s">I</a> think it lets the people at Massport know that this is something that impacts our quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1425.854s">And</a> I just wanted to just say that in support of this resolution, and hopefully we can do something to reduce the flights that cross over our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1436.043s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_2MzH8zDWQL0/2025-03-21_2MzH8zDWQL0.html">Medford, MA City Council - June 21, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1839.359s">Chair</a> recognizes Counsel Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1840.94s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1842.121s">Thank</a> you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1842.521s">Baker,</a> for your report. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1844.182s">Right</a> here.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1846.133s">Oh,</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1847.373s">You</a> had mentioned about getting the report on a monthly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1851.956s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1852.516s">And</a> I think that's what we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1853.757s">I</a> know when I was in the school committee, that's what I recommended, because there was virtually no budget reporting until we got to the budget time of year, which was in May, June time frame. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1863.703s">And</a> I think what we should have here is we should have budget to actuals on a monthly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1868.746s">It</a> makes complete sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1870.267s">We</a> should be monitoring the budget on a monthly basis to see, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1875.078s">how</a> things are, you know, unfolding as we progress through the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1878.819s">The</a> budget process shouldn't be just in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1881.719s">It</a> should be in a monthly basis where we follow it, each of us, so we can see where is money being spent, how the accounts are being spent down, and, you know, whether or not, you know, we should be allocating things differently in years, next year or the year after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1895.642s">So,</a> I think I'd like to see budget to actual reporting that we get on a monthly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1900.562s">I</a> think it'd be beneficial to all of us to actually keep our eyes on the numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1904.404s">and</a> to see which way we're going and to see how we end up at the end of the year when we actually get the budget.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1912.105s">OK,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1913.146s">I</a> definitely think it's the way we need to head. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1917.446s">The</a> budget process should be a process that we look at every month. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1920.647s">It</a> can't be just in that May, June, or sometimes just June time frame. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1924.848s">So</a> if we could get that on a monthly basis, I think that's something that we desperately need.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1929.368s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2660.431s">Sorry,</a> I scribbled it quick, my fault. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2663.553s">I</a> received a call last night, or actually a number of calls and messages regarding paving that was done last night in a bottle, actually, <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2673.439s">They</a> were actually digging up the road over by dug our park last night about 11 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2678.261s">And</a> it seems rather late to be doing any type of road work. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2681.842s">But</a> no one in the neighborhood seemed to know anything about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2684.423s">So</a> if we could get a report back from the administration as to why the work was being done so late, basically why it's being done, when it's going to be finished, and why the residents did not receive any type of notification regarding <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2700.882s">the</a> road work. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2701.563s">I</a> mean, to be doing road work at 11 o'clock at night seems to be unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2706.427s">So</a> it'd be nice if we could get some answers from the administration or from the Department of Public Works with regard to why that work is being done.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_hFAk--zIv7g/2025-03-21_hFAk--zIv7g.html">Medford, MA City Council - June 14, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9065.015s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9066.596s">I</a> want to start out by thanking everyone for coming down here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9070.218s">This</a> is a very important issue that really affects Locust Street, but in general, it really affects and impacts the whole city. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9079.666s">So</a> I really thank you for coming down. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9081.327s">It's</a> been a long night, and I thank you for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9084.229s">And</a> it's valuable to hear your opinions, because many of you live in the neighborhood, <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9088.791s">You're</a> going to experience this on a firsthand basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9092.072s">So</a> thank you for your time tonight and for coming down. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9096.034s">I</a> said it last week, and I'll say it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9098.135s">I</a> am completely against this project in this current state. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9103.917s">It's</a> too big. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9105.298s">It's</a> too big. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9106.599s">492</a> units, 781 parking spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9111.141s">You</a> have Wegmans across the street, Lumiere down the road, the casino coming in in Everett. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9117.985s">It's</a> just too big. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9118.665s">There's</a> just too much traffic in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9121.266s">There's</a> too much traffic in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9122.966s">No</a> matter where you go, this city is congested with traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9127.207s">We</a> need to find a solution to that, in addition to these issues that we talked about tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9133.328s">I</a> made a motion earlier in the year that we have to hire a traffic engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9137.309s">It</a> is needed in the worst way. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9138.79s">I</a> talked to the police chief about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9141.05s">He</a> agrees with it as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9142.57s">It</a> needs to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9143.671s">Traffic</a> is out of control. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9145.376s">And</a> if you put in a development like this, it's going to be complete chaos. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9149.199s">Locust</a> Street is a two-lane road. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9151.461s">Then</a> you get out to the parkway that's bad already, this is going to be even worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9154.764s">So</a> this development, to me, in its current state, makes absolutely no sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9161.389s">I'm</a> not saying that I'm completely against development, but it should be smart development. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9165.212s">It</a> needs to be in common sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9166.893s">It</a> needs to take into account the quality of life and the people that live in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9171.775s">Because</a> when you think about it, at the end of the day, this actually is going to alter the fabric of the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9176.578s">So</a> we want to make sure that we're doing the right thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9179.08s">And</a> like I said, this is too big, and it needs to be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9182.763s">The</a> scope of this project is absolutely massive. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9186.125s">It</a> is massive. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9186.926s">They</a> are trying to actually build on every square inch of this land. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9191.329s">It's</a> completely out of hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9193.41s">And</a> what I don't like about this is the developer comes in and they're trying to build the biggest thing they can, make the most money they can, and then what happens is they end up leaving and then you and me and everyone in this city is left to deal with the problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9209.782s">The</a> traffic, the parking, the overflow parking, the potential for school overcrowding. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9216.427s">So</a> this could actually potentially create a lot of problems if it was to go through in its current state. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9223.18s">But</a> most of all, what I really don't like, and I am concerned about, is that a project of this scope sets precedent. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9231.386s">It</a> sets precedent. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9232.687s">If</a> someone comes in and builds a 500-unit condominium complex, what prevents the people down on Mystic Ave, where there's an open lot, what prevents them from saying, hey, you did 500 units down on Locust Street, why can't we do 500 on Mystic Ave? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9247.078s">Why</a> can't we do 500 on Riverside Ave? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9249.179s">It</a> makes absolutely no sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9251.581s">And</a> we need to look at zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9253.845s">I</a> made a resolution earlier in the year with regard to zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9257.066s">The</a> zoning laws in our city, in my opinion, are terribly outdated. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9261.147s">Zoning</a> needs to be looked at, and it needs to be looked at soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9265.127s">And,</a> as far as I'm concerned, the city administration has to come up with a plan, a master plan for development. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9273.109s">People</a> have realized, and especially developers have realized, <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9278.503s">everything</a> that we know, that Medford is a great place to live, a great place to work, a great place to play, and a great place to raise a family. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9286.349s">And</a> what's happening now is developers are coming in, and they're trying to take every opportunity they can to build on every square inch of land. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9294.716s">And</a> we must stand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9297.258s">In</a> my opinion, 11 variances, it violates the spirit of the zoning ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9306.285s">It's</a> too many. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9307.726s">Absolutely</a> too many. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9309.707s">I</a> mean, I understand most complexes, there probably are some variances. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9315.809s">11</a> is completely, to me, above and beyond. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9318.95s">It</a> doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9321.711s">You</a> look at 7 Canal Street, that went down, and that was only 30 units. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9328.554s">This</a> here, or close to 500 units. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9330.394s">500</a> units, 11 variances, completely <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9336.293s">It</a> doesn't make any sense to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9337.394s">This</a> is not smart growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9338.674s">This</a> is not good planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9340.895s">This</a> is someone trying to come in, build a development, and make as much money as they can, and leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9348.419s">And</a> the residents, they're going to be the ones in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9353.062s">We're</a> going to be the ones to actually have to take care of the problems when it's all over. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9358.545s">So</a> I just want to go on the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9359.925s">I</a> completely am against this development in its current state. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9365.429s">I</a> thank everyone for coming down tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=9366.91s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=10979.514s">I</a> just know we have limited time, so I'm just trying to question — <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=10982.304s">different</a> outcomes and whatnot, you know, what our options are. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=10985.706s">So</a> that's... Right.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2587.725s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2588.986s">And</a> I want to also thank Councilor Longo for bringing this up tonight as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2596.83s">This</a> has been one of my major concerns as being elected. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2600.651s">And</a> I made a resolution earlier in the year, back in March, that we need to take a complete look and review our zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2608.916s">Because</a> it's at the point now where Mefford has become very desirable, which is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2614.208s">We</a> have all kinds of developers that want to come in and do whatever they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2617.789s">And</a> that's a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2619.91s">I'm</a> for development. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2620.99s">I</a> like development. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2621.771s">But</a> it needs to be smart development. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2624.151s">It</a> needs to be well thought out. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2626.432s">We</a> are in a great location. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2628.393s">We're</a> close to Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2629.473s">But</a> development needs to be thought out. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2632.074s">And</a> I think a lot of our zoning is outdated. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2636.116s">It</a> needs to be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2637.396s">And</a> we're at the point now where we've let it go for so long that trying to reel it in is going to be pretty tough. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2644.082s">I</a> had a resolution to take a look at complete zoning for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2649.363s">It's</a> an expensive endeavor. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2650.804s">It</a> probably costs probably maybe about a quarter of a million dollars, but I think in my mind, it's probably money well spent because we are at a pivotal moment now where we have a lot of developers coming in and we're either gonna go in a direction where we're gonna just develop all over the place or we're gonna put on the brakes and say, wait a minute, we need to actually have a master plan <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2672.436s">as</a> to where we want our city to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2675.639s">And</a> I really think that we need to take a look at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2677.84s">My</a> opinion, I will be honest with you, I think it's too big. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2681.783s">492</a> units in that neighborhood with Wegmans coming in, a casino down the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2688.388s">I</a> mean, the traffic, it's a two-lane road now. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2690.79s">Can</a> you imagine the traffic when you have 492 units of Wegmans <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2696.018s">the</a> casino and just the traffic that we have in that neighborhood now. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2699.601s">It</a> would be out of control. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2701.503s">I</a> recommended early in the year that we hire a traffic engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2704.566s">It's</a> not in the budget this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2706.348s">It's</a> not in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2707.009s">We</a> need a traffic engineer now more than ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2710.432s">If</a> we're going to have development, it has to be thought out. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2714.436s">The</a> way I look at this, this has not been well thought out. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2717.598s">They're</a> going to come in, they're going to try to build this huge development, and this is going to be a major problem for everyone in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2723.88s">And</a> it's not just in that neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2725.08s">We</a> actually have traffic nightmares everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2728.441s">We</a> have a lot of concerns here. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2729.622s">They</a> need to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2730.602s">They</a> need to be addressed now. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2732.382s">I</a> know the resolution I had with regard to zoning went to the zoning subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2736.844s">I</a> believe we've had one meeting on it so far, and we'll have more to look at it, you know, again. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2742.905s">But</a> it's something that we need to act on now. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2745.832s">And</a> I thank Councilor Longo for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2749.733s">I</a> think it's, you know, the citizens need to speak up about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2754.314s">Everyone</a> should have a chance to weigh in. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2756.634s">With</a> regard to the project that Donna, I believe Councilor Caraviello mentioned earlier at 7 Canal, I was against that one as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2765.696s">I</a> actually spoke up on it at the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2769.377s">That's</a> how strongly I feel about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2770.817s">I'm</a> not, it's not that I'm against development, but it needs to be smart, well thought out development. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2776.63s">And</a> a lot of these developers will come in and say, well, it's going to be transit-oriented. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2780.791s">People</a> are going to walk to Wellington Station. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2782.672s">They</a> cannot guarantee that. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2784.412s">They</a> can't guarantee that people are not going to have cars and that they're going to walk to Wellington Station. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2789.854s">They</a> always claim, well, they're millennials, and millennials don't own cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2794.215s">They</a> take public transit everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2796.095s">That's</a> what they were trying to sell us in the project at Seven Canals. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2799.316s">That's</a> not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2801.737s">I</a> know plenty of millennials. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2802.977s">I'm</a> not a millennial, but I know plenty of them, and they all own cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2806.9s">They</a> all need a place, they all need a way to get somewhere other than public transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2812.244s">So</a> I think, you know, we are at a pivotal point. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2814.906s">I</a> thank Councilor Lungo-Koehn for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2818.069s">I</a> think this is something that the residents should weigh in on. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2821.912s">I</a> welcome their thoughts and opinions on this and, you know, I look forward to talking about this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2827.556s">But</a> I will be honest with you, I feel it's too big for the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=2831.139s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3455.949s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3456.869s">I'd</a> like to amend the resolution to get a report back with the, to find out what the variances that were requested are.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3484.968s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3485.668s">And</a> I guess which ones were approved.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3491.37s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3496.232s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3496.632s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4921.477s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4922.478s">I'd</a> just like to make one more amendment to the resolution, and that is if we could obtain a copy of the traffic study.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4941.068s">You</a> are correct.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4948.269s">It</a> did go to the OCD board and then it went from there to the ZBA.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4957.074s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4957.854s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8056.424s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8057.705s">Chair</a> recognizes Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8059.645s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8060.626s">Thank</a> you, Alicia. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8062.387s">So</a> you had mentioned earlier, you had mentioned that three communities decided to get out, <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8069.6s">I</a> think we talked briefly about that at the Committee of the Whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8074.924s">I</a> think we figured out the length of contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8077.826s">They</a> only did it for a year, so they really couldn't get the discount that they wanted, because the length of the term wasn't really long enough to get the savings that they thought they were going to get.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8089.033s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8091.754s">So</a> they decided to leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8093.956s">Do</a> we know why they're going back in now? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8096.486s">Is</a> it truly because of the terms?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8203.53s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8204.231s">So</a> now, if I'm correct, <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8206.657s">Currently</a> in our current state, I could go out and negotiate my own rate with a supplier, right?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8212.06s">In</a> theory, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8212.64s">In</a> theory. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8213.181s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8218.523s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8219.584s">Just</a> because I know, I talk to a lot of just residents after the committee, the whole, and a lot of them actually seem to be interested, especially because if there could potentially be a savings there, why not? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8231.651s">And</a> especially if you can opt out, that seems to be a pretty good deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8236.421s">So</a> in the communities that have actually gone with this, do they find, is there an average cost savings over a year?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8273.425s">So</a> it could possibly be in the range of savings per year between $40 and $120 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8279.429s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8281.53s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8289.496s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8290.42s">deserve.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8291.741s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9261.606s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9264.307s">One</a> quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9265.707s">That</a> is, do we know how many <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9268.873s">residents</a> in Medford are on the default rate? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9272.955s">We'd</a> like a percentage. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9273.856s">Do</a> we have any idea?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9276.377s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9296.81s">Because,</a> I mean, just thinking and talking to people in the community, it just seems like most people would be on the default, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9304.273s">Because</a> I think they're just not aware of what they can do with regard to electric.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9372.874s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9373.495s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11584.789s">This</a> has come to my attention over the past, well, recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11590.373s">I</a> believe it's DCR property that it's at the intersection of Webster Street and Fountain. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11596.577s">So</a> if you took a left on the Fountain, it's that really odd, it's like an off-ramp, but you can go left and you can, it's like a two-way street. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11605.283s">It's</a> very dangerous to begin with. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11607.224s">But</a> the grass there has gotta be, if I'm guessing, two and a half to three feet tall. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11612.543s">And</a> when you come out of there, if you're taking a left, it's really a safety issue if you're trying to take a left coming out of there. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11618.425s">So</a> I would ask that the mayor contact the DCR to actually have that cut as soon as- It's the DOT? <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11626.767s">Okay,</a> the DOT, whoever owns that property, DOT, DCR, to have that trimmed immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11632.809s">It's</a> a safety hazard and it needs to be addressed as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=11636.663s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_B3oaa8YVtBA/2025-03-21_B3oaa8YVtBA.html">Medford, MA City Council - May 31, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2367.96s">If</a> we could amend the paper then to actually have the city engineer report back to us to find out who is responsible for the additional costs if the road does begin to sag after we've received the funding from national grid.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2433.234s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2433.634s">That's</a> one of my main concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2434.635s">I</a> mean, this is a problem throughout the city where, you know, time goes by. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2440.297s">if</a> we know what it sags into the ground, if we know you have potholes and you have a whole street falling apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2445.039s">So,</a> um, yeah, I think it's something that we need to have addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2448.401s">And</a> if we could have the, uh, city engineer, uh, come back to us with a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2452.203s">I</a> greatly appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2453.444s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5717.168s">Actually,</a> I think Vice President Longo already mentioned it, but if you could just have a, when you've paved your last sidewalk and pulled your last stump out for the season, if you could just have a report like this just with an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5733.083s">just</a> so we can see what was accomplished with the $500,000, you know, however much money is being appropriated here. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5740.785s">So</a> it'd be nice just to kind of see actually how much we're getting done. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5745.107s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5745.767s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7659.529s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=7660.51s">I</a> reviewed the records, found them to be in order, and move approval.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_zvHrHUNZKmI/2025-03-21_zvHrHUNZKmI.html">Medford, MA City Council - May 24, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4612.124s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4613.185s">I'd</a> like to begin by, uh, um, just saying, uh, that the public safety meeting that we had last week was very, <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4619.858s">informative,</a> very educational. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4621.579s">And,</a> uh, it's something that I agree we should have on a regular basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4625.022s">I</a> think it would help us all. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4626.823s">Uh,</a> but tonight's resolution is about working together to protect our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4630.746s">Um,</a> once a month down at the Medford police station, there's a monthly meeting where residents can come and talk about the different issues in their neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4638.772s">And</a> it's a, it's a, it's a very informative meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4641.353s">I've</a> been there before. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4642.274s">I</a> have learned a lot and it's always good to see what's going on in each of the different neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4646.866s">But</a> I believe the meetings could be more productive and engage more citizens if we could actually maybe take those meetings on the road and take them to each of the, uh, the police department divides the city into four different sectors. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4659.396s">It</a> would be nice if we could actually have those meetings, um, you know, in each sector of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4666.002s">So</a> therefore the residents can go to the meeting in their neighborhood and actually talk to the police officers that actually work that neighborhood, get to know them, <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4675.925s">they</a> can get to know the issues and everybody can work together to actually solve some of the city's problems with regard to crime. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4684.229s">Um,</a> so I think there'd be very informative. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4687.13s">I</a> think there's a lot of benefits. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4688.29s">Um,</a> you know, we talked about crime data. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4690.812s">If</a> we actually got that person, if chief SACRA actually got that person in the budget that was collecting crime data and you could go over that, you know, in a neighborhood meeting and find out what's going on in your neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4702.017s">And</a> I just think it's better, <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4703.623s">for</a> our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4704.263s">It</a> helps educate everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4705.484s">We</a> all keep an eye out for each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4706.925s">And</a> I just think it's a good way of bringing everybody together. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4711.166s">The</a> reason why I said let's start in September is because they don't meet in July and August, and the last meeting's in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4718.309s">So</a> I think September would be a good starting date. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4720.07s">If</a> you did September, October, November, and December, you could hit all sectors of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4724.532s">And</a> that wouldn't limit to just, you know, I want to be clear, it's not like if we had the meeting in Wellington <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4732.543s">you</a> just talk about Wellington issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4734.004s">Anyone</a> could go to talk about any issue, but it would be in that sector of the city and you know, the residents, you know, hopefully there'll be a lot of people from that sector there, uh, to talk about the issues that happen or occur in that neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4746.71s">But</a> you know, everyone is welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4748.671s">Everybody</a> could talk about any issue that they want to. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4751.232s">Um,</a> so I, I think this is a, in my opinion, it's a good plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4754.034s">I</a> think it's something that we should do. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4755.574s">I</a> think it's something that's long overdue and I think it would definitely bring the community together. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4759.316s">So,</a> uh, I'd like to move approval.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4778.15s">I</a> would agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4778.911s">Everyone's</a> back from summer vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4780.612s">They're</a> well rested. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4781.332s">They're</a> ready to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4782.453s">They're</a> involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4783.014s">They're</a> engaged. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4783.714s">And</a> I think, you know, it'd be nice to actually have the residents from each of the neighborhoods <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4788.133s">come</a> to the meeting and be engaged in the process and what's going on, and we can all help each other out.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4891.098s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4891.398s">I</a> appreciate it.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4896.094s">You</a> bring up a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4897.034s">And</a> I think that, you know, the public safety, uh, meeting was, I think very beneficial. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4901.836s">I</a> know to me, I think everyone involved, uh, it was nice to actually, uh, you know, listen to the chief and just find out his wants and needs with regard to law enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4912.68s">And,</a> uh, you know, to me, that's very beneficial because he's there and, uh, officer McGilvery was there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4919.263s">I</a> mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4919.943s">He's</a> in the trenches every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4921.143s">He</a> sees what's going on in the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4922.644s">He</a> can actually tell you firsthand, the chief can too, what they need, what their wants are, their needs are, what would they like to see added to the police department with regard to personnel and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4932.446s">So</a> it was very beneficial. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4933.746s">I</a> think with regard to the budget, we need to make some serious decisions there. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4937.567s">I'm</a> hoping that we get a budget soon, but public safety needs to be a top priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4942.728s">And</a> I think money definitely needs to be infused <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=4947.118s">into</a> the police department.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=5005.441s">I've</a> tried. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=5006.816s">I</a> will tell you right here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=5009.597s">I</a> will take it on myself and I will organize all four meetings.

href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=108.242s">The</a> Scouts have always been a vital part of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=111.365s">They've</a> always been helping out with the various service projects throughout the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=115.007s">And</a> Troop 416 has been remarkable in producing Eagle Scouts. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=120.071s">I</a> was talking to a friend today, Chris Murphy, actually, that is a past Eagle Scout, and he was telling me at least <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=126.738s">I</a> believe there's at least maybe close to 40 Eagle Scouts that the troop has produced in the 100 years, which is quite remarkable. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=134.004s">So</a> I'd like to thank you Scouts for your commitment to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=137.287s">Also</a> thank your parents

uh, just to note, um, we have a bunch of citations here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=167.068s">Uh,</a> we had a number of scouts that attended the school committee meeting last week, uh, last night and a number of that are here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=174.716s">at</a> this meeting tonight, and there are a number of scouts that are at sports and whatnot. <a

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=4059.207s">So</a> people do have an option, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=4060.487s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=4060.968s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=4061.828s">And</a> as far as, so the operatives, is that that person who auditioned, so Zaki? <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=4067.652s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=4068.052s">So</a> Zaki actually, she's the one who actually contacts the homeowners and says, you know, what do you prefer?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=4087.182s">And</a> as far as if someone is, how does someone go about determining, say if they're new to the neighbourhood, how do they know if they're on the list or not? <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=4097.064s">Do</a> they contact your office?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=4134.598s">Okay,</a> so if someone calls me, I can say, you know, call DW Supervix, and you can be added to the list, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=4142.7s">Okay,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=4143.281s">Would</a> it be possible to provide us with a report once this is complete to actually see how many trees and stumps were actually replaced? <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=4151.568s">How</a> many stumps were grinded and how many sidewalks were replaced? <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=4155.051s">Just</a> to find out, I guess, you know, just in case it gets to a point where, you know, we don't have everything done, at least to know how much got done, what's moving in the government. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=4166.441s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=4166.921s">We'd</a> be happy to provide you with a progress report.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=8058.429s">First,</a> I'd like to thank Councilor Locke for actually agreeing to light the issue of blood levels, bloodline, and lead it to force. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=8068.258s">He's</a> talked about it in the last few meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=8069.979s">It's</a> a very important issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=8071.741s">And</a> actually, in fact, the last meeting that we had where he talked about it, I received a number of calls the next day regarding an article in the Boston Globe on May 7th about accruing students from Harvard Business School. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=8084.011s">They</a> did a number of samples taking water from public buildings, civic organizations, universities, in and around the Boston area. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=8106.123s">You</a> know, a number of buildings came back with basically 15 parts per building, per billion, which is equivalent of the UK tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=8117.649s">But</a> one of the examples that they took was right here in this apartment. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=8123.992s">And</a> when that came back, it came back with a reading of 30 parts per billion, which definitely needs to get an action. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=8131.888s">And</a> the article went on to mention that the city engineer is looking into the situation and working on an issue to find out why it's that hot and why it's in different parts per million. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=8144.43s">And</a> I think what we need to do is basically take a look at all of our city pools and make sure that we test them for lead and we test them for water flow. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=8152.152s">And</a> it's important, I mean, lead has a number of <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=8159.555s">dramatic</a> negative effects, especially on our children, our youngest population. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=8163.616s">It</a> causes developmental delays, behavioral problems, and a lot of other health issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=8170.157s">But</a> this is something that we need to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=8171.757s">We</a> need to make sure that we check all of our city buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=8174.458s">I</a> did make a call to the superintendent of the schools to ask specifically about the schools, and he did tell me that he actually has reports on the school buildings, and the schools are tested on a regular basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=8186.441s">which</a> I guess is a requirement of the MWRA. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=8188.984s">So,</a> he said he does have reports of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=8191.889s">So</a> if we could get those, if we could ask for those reports from the Superintendent of Schools, just so we could take a look at those. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=8199.099s">But</a> if we can have a... <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=8202.203s">City</a> Engineer Erin Polley, she's looking into the issues here at Bedford City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=8206.425s">We</a> could also have our other city buildings looked at, tested for lead levels, and if we could get those reports back to see where things turn out, and if we could find out how we're going to actually, how the city's going to remedy the situation here at City Hall.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=11290.007s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=11291.248s">Um,</a> let me just start off, um, this has come up at least three times in the past five months. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=11299.271s">Uh,</a> and I support. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=11305.655s">You</a> can do a lot of goal setting and trying to figure out how many puddles we fix here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=11309.337s">So</a> you look at the metrics and see what kind of data is coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=11312.399s">You</a> can really measure things. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=11313.999s">It</a> can be a very effective tool. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=11328.887s">if</a> it's managed properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=11330.809s">And</a> I really feel that this is a system that we have, it's a tool that we have, but it's not managed properly if it's managed at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=11338.537s">I</a> had a resolution back a couple of months ago with regards to the same thing about how it's being used as a walker. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=11344.283s">Someone</a> was walking their dog, and someone actually took a picture of the person walking their dog, and it ended up on scene quick fix. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=11351.85s">a</a> picture of another person should never end up in that same event. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=11355.431s">It</a> came down, but it shouldn't end up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=11357.911s">So</a> back then, I had questions about policies, procedures, and I wanted the administration to send us something back. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=11364.052s">We</a> have not received anything back yet on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=11367.353s">We</a> should be, I honestly feel, Consul Caraviello was part of the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=11373.154s">You</a> know, they did offer training. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=11374.674s">They</a> did, but it was at five o'clock in the afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=11378.235s">You</a> know, with all due respect, <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=11380.897s">Having</a> a meeting at 5 o'clock in the afternoon, you're really not going to get that many people here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=11385.118s">Most</a> of the world is still working on their way home or attending to their kids and getting dinner ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=11391.58s">I</a> mean, if you want to have a successful program and you want to train and you really want to roll it out properly, you have to make sure you communicate it right and then you train people. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=11400.872s">I</a> think that this committee could probably benefit from a training session to see how the program works, when a ticket comes in or an issue is filed, where it goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=11408.918s">You</a> know, if it goes to City Hall, what happens then? <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=11411.159s">I</a> mean, you outlined it in the process this summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=11413.721s">It's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=11414.362s">That</a> process has never been outlined for us here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=11417.264s">But</a> we really need to see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=11419.565s">And</a> I think a training would be beneficial for this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=11422.467s">I'd</a> love to see a committee in the whole meeting to grab just a secret fix. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=11425.89s">I</a> think one hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=11428.052s">I</a> think it would be beneficial to everyone in this room. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=11433.459s">I</a> think it would be beneficial to the program, and I think it would really help make this a success. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=11438.146s">I</a> think we need to bring in the vendor and see if we can make some tweaks to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=11443.608s">I</a> think it's a good program, but I think it really has to be managed properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=11447.191s">And</a> I have some reservations right now about how it's being managed. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=11451.074s">I</a> mean, is someone actually looking at this on a regular basis? <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=11454.236s">I</a> mean, you know, the purpose is to get things fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=11456.698s">And,</a> you know, there have been great points that have been made tonight about staffing. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=11462.103s">I'll</a> be honest with you, I think we're terribly understaffed. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=11465.265s">I</a> think they're doing everything they possibly can to keep up with the tickets, the Sequel Fix tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=11471.03s">But,</a> you know, I mean, at some point, <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=11473.617s">I</a> think right now we have between 9 and 12 people that work for the DW. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=11480.162s">9</a> to 12 people in a city this big. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=11484.645s">And</a> if that's not more people, we need to increase staff to keep up with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=11489.248s">But,</a> getting back to see quick fix, we need to make sure that we take a look at this, we get some sort of training, and we need to figure out how this runs, and who manages it, and make sure it's managed properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/6YHU7Hws2SA&t=11500.838s">So,</a> I think we should definitely have, maybe the whole meeting, it's come up before, we'll need to have this, we need to jump on top of this, I mean, we can talk about it all night, but we really need to sit down and take a look at this, figure out who's managing it, if anyone's managing it, make sure it's managed properly, managed properly, going into the future.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_WjkcDsmFdD4/2025-03-21_WjkcDsmFdD4.html">Medford, MA City Council - May 10, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2318.236s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2319.037s">I</a> just wanted to echo some of the sentiments of my colleagues as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2323.428s">First</a> of all, I thank Mr. Costas for his years of dedication, but the commissioners as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2328.892s">And,</a> you know, like we said earlier, during the campaign, this came up many times. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2334.476s">And</a> this is really, I think, the key to economic development in Bedford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2338.118s">We</a> have a 2000 seat theater in a downtown business district. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2341.16s">We</a> need to make sure it's utilized on a regular basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2343.562s">This</a> is an exciting opportunity to think that a company like North Shore Music Theory wants to come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2348.244s">We</a> should embrace this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2350.086s">Our</a> city needs to embrace the theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2352.688s">We</a> need to embrace this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2354.529s">I</a> think for far too long we haven't. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2356.411s">We</a> need to embrace it as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2357.792s">I</a> definitely support <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2359.467s">the</a> city putting money towards the theater during the budget process. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2364.348s">I</a> think we're heading in the right direction by doing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2366.929s">I</a> look forward to hearing the results of the meeting next week and the meeting on Thursday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2371.33s">And</a> I definitely support this initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2375.471s">I</a> believe that this is truly the key to economic development in our square. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=2380.072s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4825.807s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4828.25s">So</a> I have received a couple of calls and questions about this bubble project, and I think it's interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4835.096s">I</a> think it has potential. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4839.978s">But</a> I do believe preventive maintenance is the key. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4843.119s">I</a> mean, when I was on the school committee, one of the big things advocates I was for is maintaining and making sure that we maintain our buildings and make sure we basically provide preventive maintenance on a yearly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4856.865s">And</a> back in 2010, when I was first elected, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4861.289s">I</a> remember that was when I think Paul Edwards at the time came before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4865.131s">He</a> was the building and director, the school's buildings and directors, director. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4872.054s">And</a> I said, what are we doing for preventive maintenance? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4874.335s">He</a> said, we're doing nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4875.416s">We</a> don't have money in the budget.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4886.261s">But</a> I mean, I will say, some people may disagree. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4890.587s">over</a> time, that has improved a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4893.329s">I</a> mean, we've actually made some progress in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4896.751s">For</a> example, filters getting changed on a regular basis, whereas before, there were issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4901.013s">So</a> I mean, preventive maintenance is the key to any project. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4905.196s">In</a> a project like this, it has to be the key. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4907.978s">I</a> mean, I remember Field of Dreams. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4909.138s">It</a> was the first thing I voted on. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4911.54s">It</a> was the first issue that came before us when we were elected in 2010, was voting for the Field of Dreams. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4917.083s">I</a> still think today it's a good vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4919.705s">It's</a> a great vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4920.861s">Um,</a> you know, and I think that we have to think about when we think about education, we think of students, we have to think about well rounded students. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4926.959s">We</a> need to make sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4928.125s">you</a> know, we, we provide, uh, things both inside the classroom and outside the classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4932.969s">And</a> I, I understand your, you know, about the books. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4935.311s">We</a> do need to make sure our books are current 25 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4937.553s">I,</a> I, I didn't know we had any of that old. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4940.195s">I</a> knew we do have some old textbooks, but I didn't think they were that old. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4943.498s">But,</a> um, and I'd love to know what class we can talk afterwards, but I'd love to know what class has those because we need to get the school committee needs to know that those have to be replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4952.906s">But,</a> um, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4954.733s">But,</a> I mean, it's, you know, we want to make sure we have well-rounded students. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4957.575s">The</a> fields are a great example of how we, our children and our students, can actually use, you know, get physical activity through sports and recreation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4966.461s">And</a> it's important that we have, you know, state-of-the-art facilities to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4970.404s">But</a> for me, you know, it comes down to preventive maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4973.326s">And</a> what I'd like to see is, you know, and if I could amend the resolution, is just to receive a business plan from the school committee as to what they're going to do as far as <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4982.223s">you</a> know, how much is going to be charged, the plans to rent it out, I mean, how much is being set aside for preventive maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4988.37s">So</a> if we could add that to the resolution, I'd greatly appreciate it.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=4995.118s">If</a> we get the school committee could give us the proposed business plan for the fields with regard to, um, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5003.208s">with</a> your charging the cost, how much is going back to preventive maintenance, basically the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5007.893s">What's</a> the plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5008.634s">I</a> mean, I know we talked a little bit about the hours, you know, who's gonna be renting it out if possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=5015.041s">I</a> mean, that type of thing, the type of programming that's gonna be offered.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6638.895s">You</a> are correct, there is actually a timeline or time frame as to, I believe, the objectives of the plan have to be in place, and that needs to be approved by the state, and then the funding will come, and then the money has to be spent by the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=6653.977s">June</a> 30th, 2017.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7133.715s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7134.855s">Um,</a> I agree with my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7136.276s">I</a> think enforcement is a major issue, but I also think, um, it just comes down to traffic and they offered a resolution back in February to hire a traffic consultant or traffic engineer to come in and take a look at the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7148.601s">This</a> situation is only going to get worse and we live in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7152.903s">We</a> just live, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7154.197s">In</a> a section of the state where there's just tons of traffic, we need to have a professional come in and take a look at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7159.942s">If</a> you take a look at South Medford, you take a look at the Wegmans neighborhood down by the mall, the Shaw's development, the potential casino.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7167.75s">North</a> Medford, with that possible development at the Malvern Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7172.754s">It's</a> happening all over the city, and we need to actually have a professional come in and take a look at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7177.279s">We</a> don't have a traffic consultant <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7179.239s">in</a> this traffic engineer in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7181.14s">We</a> need to get some sort of help. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7183.061s">And</a> I think that this should hopefully be included in the budget this year because I honestly feel this problem is going to get worse and it really needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7190.484s">You</a> know, I take a look at the emails that come in and the pictures. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7193.045s">It's</a> horrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7193.585s">People</a> parking on sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7195.265s">That's</a> common sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7196.286s">It's</a> just not allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7196.986s">It's</a> against the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7199.067s">It</a> comes down to enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7200.528s">But</a> traffic is a major issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7202.388s">I</a> really think that a traffic engineer needs to be consulted or hired hopefully sooner than later and hopefully in this budget cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7209.405s">And</a> hopefully, this issue gets resolved soon.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7223.613s">I</a> just feel like I feel that we need something current, but we need to look at our whole city and look at all the traffic patterns in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7230.437s">We</a> have some major traffic problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=7231.778s">They</a> need to be addressed, and they're not going to go away.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8732.311s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8734.888s">Yeah,</a> I was looking at the resolution, and as far as I know, I mean, there is no residency requirement, as far as I know. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8740.512s">So</a> I guess I'm not sure why there's an issue, I guess, because it doesn't seem there's no residency requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8747.217s">When</a> we review the budget, I mean, there's no, when we look at the salaries, there's no addresses next to the name. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8752.622s">So</a> to me, it shouldn't be an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8756.325s">I</a> mean, I don't, I guess I'm not really sure why this is coming before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8766.85s">I</a> hate to say it, but it seems like we're chasing down a rumor. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8771.152s">Point</a> of information, Madam Vice President.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8849.773s">Yeah,</a> I mean, just to reiterate, I actually made the same call as well, as Mr. Schiappelli did. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8855.556s">I</a> get the same answer that 11 employees, and they're all surrounded in New England states. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=8862.22s">It's</a> like New Hampshire, Rhode Island, maybe Connecticut.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9608.743s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9609.764s">I</a> did make a call when I saw the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9611.845s">I</a> had some questions myself, so I did call, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9616.532s">superintendent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9617.272s">And</a> I did ask about these various projects, feel the dreams, the swimming pool and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9622.495s">And</a> it, uh, Mr. Scarpelli is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9624.876s">Uh,</a> council Scarpelli that, uh, the school committee is going to be receiving reports in this on a Monday evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9631.279s">So</a> I would assume that we would get reports shortly after that, hopefully on Tuesday, but, uh, they are going to be getting, uh, these types of reports on Monday. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9639.083s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=9639.743s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10269.701s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10271.805s">I,</a> uh, I thank my colleague, uh, uh, Councilor Marks for bringing this up last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10276.166s">And,</a> uh, actually, um, the reason why this actually came up is I was waiting for the bus to take the three 25 bus into town. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10283.328s">And,</a> uh, it was actually at that intersection last Friday and, um, almost saw someone get hit by a car. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10289.37s">And,</a> um, that intersection is really dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10292.631s">Um,</a> and as I looked around, the crosswalks are all faded, so they really need to be repainted or relined or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10299.313s">But,</a> um, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10300.979s">It's</a> a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10301.46s">I</a> mean, that intersection there, I see adults having a tough time crossing the street there in the morning, and when they get off the bus at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10309.526s">It's</a> the last intersection before you get onto the off-ramp on 93. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10312.949s">So</a> it really needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10314.15s">So</a> I'd ask that that be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10315.651s">And</a> since I've actually put this resolution out there, I got a call from a resident as well, or an email, about the, from the corner of Parris Street to the corner of Dudley.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10334.322s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10334.763s">And</a> if we could, um, if we could also look at around, uh, various neighborhood schools, not neighborhood schools, but at our various schools, we can take a look at the crosswalks in those areas as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10345.006s">The</a> weather's nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10345.787s">People</a> are walking and, uh, there's a lot of, uh, children walking to and from school that live close to the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10351.669s">So</a> if we could take a look at those crosswalks as well, um, I think, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10355.579s">uh,</a> there'll be benefit to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10356.9s">So</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WjkcDsmFdD4&t=10358.241s">Councilor</a> Caraviello.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_jCO6jvvXtn0/2025-03-21_jCO6jvvXtn0.html">Medford, MA City Council - May 3, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=82.386s">It's</a> a pleasure to have you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=4605.241s">Councilor</a> Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=4606.182s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=4607.522s">Thank</a> you to Councilor Langelker for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=4611.605s">I</a> agree that we definitely need to have a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=4613.926s">This</a> is a major development that's going to impact that neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=4618.869s">I've</a> been getting many questions as well throughout the community, just specifically about the timeframe of the project, the layout of the area, but in particular the traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=4628.995s">Do</a> we know, is the parking lot going to <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=4633.112s">remain</a> the same as far as the way it's cut right now, the entrance, the exits. <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=4636.855s">Are</a> there going to be any changes to that? <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=4638.717s">Has</a> there been any talk about traffic?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=4642.46s">If</a> you take a look at that project and then the project over at Shaw's, you're talking about a major amount of cars compared to what <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=4651.415s">the</a> traffic flow down there now. <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=4652.696s">So</a> if you could talk a little bit about traffic.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=4909.452s">Has</a> there been any talk about, like I noticed, <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=4913.59s">490</a> units, so what are we talking as far as height? <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=4917.811s">I</a> mean, do we know how tall these buildings are going to be?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=4933.073s">And</a> that's four or five stories? <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=4934.374s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=4937.494s">That's</a> what I was thinking, is that it would require a variance in that area?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=4972.468s">So</a> now as a comparison, if those are going to be four or five stories, how tall are Mystic Towers doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=4977.572s">How</a> long?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=4980.854s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=4981.034s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=4990.7s">Do</a> we know if I, I'm not sure if you know the answer to this question.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=4994.399s">Oh,</a> three and four.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=4997.94s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=4998.68s">And</a> do we know if that's a, does that pose a problem for any of our emergency vehicles, fire trucks or anything like that? <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=5004.401s">As</a> far as if it was an issue.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=5019.924s">Did</a> the fire department have any concerns?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=6305.182s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=6306.283s">If</a> I could add two things to the meeting agenda when we do meet with the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=6310.985s">Budget</a> format. <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=6312.653s">I</a> mentioned it a while ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=6313.733s">I</a> think it's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=6314.834s">We</a> need to see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=6315.794s">It's</a> one of the most important responsibilities that we have, passing the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=6322.975s">And</a> we should know what it's going to look like, the format at least, before we get to those meetings, before we get the budget book, so we know what we're dealing with. <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=6330.757s">So</a> that's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=6331.797s">I</a> want to see that addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=6332.677s">And</a> I'd also like to see budget calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=6335.498s">When</a> are we expected to get the budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=6337.538s">When</a> are we going to meet with department heads? <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=6339.199s">I</a> think it's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=6340.397s">And</a> I'd like to see that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=6341.397s">So</a> if we could discuss that at the meeting, I'd greatly appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/jCO6jvvXtn0&t=6344.298s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4387.069s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4387.429s">Could</a> we maybe get a report back from the building department? <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4390.905s">to</a> find out what kind of communication goes out from the city to the property owners up in that area with regard to cleanup. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4397.828s">When</a> I talked to John Babuso tonight, he had mentioned to me that, I guess, I think the property owner was not aware of, you know, I think the policies regarding dumping things on the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4411.595s">I'm</a> not sure if that's true or not, but I mean, it seems like common sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4415.436s">I</a> took a drive up there yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4417.197s">It</a> was a disgrace, I'm sorry, on Sunday afternoon, it was a disgrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4420.018s">There</a> was stuff all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4421.499s">The</a> residents should not have to live like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4424.0s">And</a> I'd also support Councilor Knight's idea about having an ordinance with regarding having the university be accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4434.824s">And</a> I think that's something that we should look at in subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4437.225s">Very</a> good.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=5166.301s">Mr.</a> President, I actually have a comment and something else so I can wait.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=5176.688s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=5177.989s">Um,</a> I, uh, see, uh, back in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=5181.732s">So</a> about three months ago I offered a resolution one six dash Oh one eight regarding the city's budget upcoming budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=5187.936s">And</a> I had asked for a budget template. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=5190.014s">from</a> the finance director, from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=5193.095s">We</a> have still not—we haven't heard anything from the finance director, and we are getting into budget season. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=5200.257s">I</a> think three months has been appropriate, and I'm starting to get calls, people asking me about what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=5206.859s">We</a> still haven't heard anything from the budget director. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=5209.08s">I've</a> swapped emails with her, but we're still waiting for something formal that we can see. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=5215.79s">when</a> we go into the actual budget, it's not, we're not seeing it for the first time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=5219.631s">So</a> we should be working together here and I'd like some sort of response. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=5223.753s">Um,</a> so if we could get a response back from the budget director or from the mayor, I'd greatly appreciate it.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_nXRer8wKd5o/2025-03-21_nXRer8wKd5o.html">Medford, MA City Council - Apr. 19, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1738.202s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1739.383s">I</a> received a number of calls this week regarding the C-Click Fix System. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1745.569s">I</a> support the C-Click Fix System 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1748.432s">I</a> think it's a great tool. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1749.793s">It's</a> a great way to monitor issues and actually get things done efficiently. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1756.58s">But</a> it seems that <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1758.822s">We've</a> had a number of issues recently where it's almost becoming more of a populist of some sort, where people, the specific call that I got this week was that someone took a picture of someone else doing something wrong and putting it on CNN. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1774.933s">And</a> that is something that's been taken down. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1778.315s">But</a> I really think that we should know as a community council, what are the policies <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1791.975s">But</a> is there a screening process? <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1794.917s">Are</a> there any policies that you're suggesting behind the system when things actually get recorded and logged on the system? <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1804.082s">I</a> know, I believe, a few weeks ago, Consular Marks had a resolution regarding it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1808.564s">We</a> need to have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1815.028s">I</a> think when people talk about issues like this, the policies and guidelines, it's good to get a presentation on how it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1821.612s">And</a> I know Andrew mentioned weeks ago as well that it'd be nice to see the type of reporting that we can receive as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1832.877s">I'm</a> really concerned about the policies, the procedures, the guidelines that surround the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1839.34s">And</a> I think we need to work with them at this point in time.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1924.504s">I</a> think it's a great system. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1927.708s">I</a> think it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1929.95s">I</a> support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1932.093s">If</a> used properly, I think it's a system that can be used to bring neighborhoods together and not be divisive so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1940.442s">I</a> support this as a monitor, Senator, just to get some more information. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1946.346s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3185.314s">They</a> had one this past weekend.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2669.238s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2670.859s">Over</a> the past several months, the issue of zoning has come up during numerous conversations and phone calls I've had with residents throughout our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2679.402s">Bedford</a> is becoming a more popular place to live with its close proximity to Boston and its abundance of green space. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2687.013s">Many</a> Holtenbuyers are beginning to notice this, but developers are as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2692.735s">This</a> resolution tonight is a proactive attempt to review our zoning and to protect the integrity of our neighborhoods and guide new development. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2699.877s">There's</a> been a lot of talk lately about redeveloping Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2704.558s">With</a> the redevelopment of Medford Square, that may include mixed-use development. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2709.919s">It</a> might include residential units in the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2713.078s">Developers</a> may need additional height to make this kind of proposal work. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2717.359s">They</a> may not, but we need to work with the administration on this here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2722.0s">If</a> you take a look over the past several weeks, there've been numerous discussions about historical properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2727.921s">They</a> need to be protected as much as possible, but we also have to make sure that protection must be balanced against the rights of property owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2738.464s">Residential</a> units, <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2740.025s">If</a> you drive through the city, you'll see residential units that have been built in industrial zones. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2745.127s">People</a> have asked me about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2746.227s">How</a> does that happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2749.229s">If</a> you take a look at our use table, when you look at our zoning ordinances, you take a look at the most recent issues where it wasn't too long ago we had a massage parlor in Bedford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2761.493s">I</a> mean, to me, I don't want that type of business in my downtown area. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2766.705s">So</a> these are things that we need to look at, and we need to look at sooner than later. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2771.788s">I</a> mean, I think a lot of people that I've talked to said, these things probably should have been looked at years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2777.092s">But</a> we really need to look at them now, because there's all kinds of rumors with regard to development, major development, that's going to be happening throughout our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2787.059s">And</a> we need to make sure that the city is zoned properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2790.321s">So</a> of course, I support this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2793.063s">I</a> hope my colleagues do as well, and they move
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2924.893s">A</a> consultant would cost, I did talk to someone who said it would probably cost in the range of probably between $100,000 and $200,000, which is a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2933.972s">but</a> we do not have the capacity to do it here at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2937.295s">Our</a> staffing is low. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2938.296s">We're</a> at bare bones when it comes to the OCD office. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2941.298s">We</a> don't have, and I'm not saying that the people aren't qualified to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2945.362s">I</a> don't think they have the time to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2946.703s">We</a> don't have the personnel to do something like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2949.926s">And</a> I mean, more and more every day you're seeing development and developers come in and they want to do all kinds of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2957.993s">And</a> you know, everybody's looking for a variance. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2960.885s">You</a> know, like Councilor Caraviello said tonight, you go across the hall tonight, that room's packed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2966.568s">It's</a> packed with people looking for a variance. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2968.709s">And</a> I feel like we haven't looked at it for so long that this needs to be addressed sooner than later. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2975.512s">You</a> know, if my colleagues wanted to go to a subcommittee because they have more questions, I'm fine with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2981.494s">You</a> know, I want everybody to feel comfortable before they make a vote on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2984.536s">But</a> I think that this is something that really needs to be addressed sooner than later. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2989.572s">You</a> know, does it cost money? <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2990.693s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2991.433s">But</a> I honestly don't think we have the number of people that it'll take to really do this the right way. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2999.277s">And,</a> um, it's an expensive endeavor. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3001.359s">Yes,</a> absolutely.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3010.924s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3011.644s">But</a> I think it's long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3012.725s">I</a> mean, I don't think we've taken a look at our zoning ordinances in, I would say close to, <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3016.76s">From</a> what I've heard, close to 40 years.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3031.173s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3031.574s">I</a> mean, it's consistent. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3032.755s">The</a> complaints are consistent that zoning needs to be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3036.058s">And</a> if we want to make sure that we develop our city properly, we need to make sure that we look at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3041.382s">It's</a> been far too long as far as I'm concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3043.623s">It</a> probably should have been acted on years ago, but we need to get on top of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3047.645s">And</a> yes, it's going to cost money, but I think it's an investment in our future. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3052.207s">And</a> really, I take a look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3054.028s">I</a> really feel that at the end of the day, if we invest the money, we're really going to be protecting the integrity of our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3060.231s">Because</a> once we start to allow variances for heights of different buildings, you're starting to set precedent. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3068.415s">And</a> once you set precedent, <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3069.887s">It</a> just gets out of control, and that causes problems.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3086.107s">So</a> that's why I'd like to move approval on this.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3238.759s">If</a> we want to move it to Committee of the Whole, I'm completely fine with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3243.801s">People</a> need to get more comfortable with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3247.282s">In</a> my opinion, we need a full review. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3250.263s">And</a> a full review and recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3252.624s">And</a> that's my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3254.305s">But</a> if we want to go to a Committee of the Whole with it, I'm fine with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3258.486s">Subcommittee</a> is fine with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3259.767s">We</a> can do subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3260.727s">I'm</a> completely fine with that.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3751.153s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3752.414s">Thank</a> you for asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3754.856s">I</a> have received, you know, when I was a member of the school committee, <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3759.365s">You</a> know, and now even as a member of the council, you know, I received calls, and this winter hasn't been bad, but you look at past winters, and, you know, we always encourage our residents, make sure you shovel your sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3770.051s">Make</a> sure you get in front, you know, remove the snow so people aren't forced out into the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3774.894s">And,</a> you know, I think that the city should be, you know, held to the same standard. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3779.397s">You</a> know, we have plenty of sidewalks that go right by city property, they're not plowed, and, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3787.175s">So</a> we need something, you know, we need a piece of equipment to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3790.256s">I</a> called the DPW and did my homework and asked them, do you have something that specifically plows sidewalks or removes some snow from sidewalks? <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3800.321s">And</a> they said they do not have a specific piece of equipment that does that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3804.983s">And</a> they said that the equipment that they use actually doesn't really work well at removing snow from sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3810.985s">So</a> this track box plow is basically, it's a smaller version of a larger plow. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3816.012s">I</a> have pictures if you'd like to see them, awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3818.974s">But</a> what you do is this plow, it does not have to be moved from different parts of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3825.458s">This</a> thing can actually just go, for example, the DCR has a trackless plow. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3830.081s">They</a> started in Stoneham, it comes all the way down on the sidewalk, all the way down Route 28, down the Fellsway, down towards Wellington, up Route 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3839.067s">So</a> it basically goes on a continuous loop. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3841.669s">So</a> what we need to do, I feel, is we need to actually have a piece of equipment like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3846.35s">to</a> clear our streets, or to clear our sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3849.431s">We</a> stress the importance of being healthy and walking and bicycling. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3853.552s">And</a> I think that this will go a long way in helping our residents stay safe during the winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3859.433s">But</a> this piece of equipment is not just for snow. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3862.814s">So</a> it's efficient that it can be used for other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3865.995s">It</a> can be used to mow lawns. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3868.255s">It</a> can be used as a leaf loader, a front end loader, a stump grinder, an auger. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3872.436s">So</a> definitely, it can be used for <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3875.609s">different</a> situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3876.55s">So</a> it's not just for the snow, but it will go a long way in keeping our, um, keeping our residents safe, keeping our sidewalks clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3884.896s">And</a> like I said, we should, our city should be held to the same standard that residents are held to, uh, with regard to removing snow. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3891.541s">So,</a> uh, I'd like to move for approval on this.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4020.646s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4021.527s">Uh,</a> there's one thing if I could add, uh, Mr. Scarpelli did actually ask for the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4026.012s">If</a> we could have, when they supply the list, if they could supply the date, the year, the, the year of the vehicle, just so we know how old the equipment is. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4035.162s">I</a> think that'd be a go a long way and just trying to determine, um, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4040.357s">where</a> we are with regards to the equipment.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4060.488s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4060.929s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4061.929s">I</a> actually, um, I had Friday off. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4064.311s">So</a> I went down to the DPW yard and, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4067.345s">They</a> have some old equipment down there, but actually some of it is quite useful. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4071.628s">They</a> actually have a snow, they showed it to me, it's actually a snow thrower from 1972. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4076.772s">But</a> they said it's one of the best pieces of equipment that they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4079.694s">It</a> literally just, it's a giant snowball. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4082.075s">And</a> so you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4084.377s">With</a> regard to some equipment, I think it's good to know though, if you're driving around a pickup truck from 1994, that could be an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4092.123s">So</a> especially if you're hauling different types of material around. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4095.868s">But</a> I know they definitely are in some need of equipment down there, and it'd be great to get a wish list from them to see what they actually need. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4102.354s">Awesome.</a> 
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4153.008s">Well,</a> you know, from what I hear, and I'm not a professional when it comes to this type of equipment, but I mean, from what I hear, using a bobcat to clear sidewalks is not really an efficient way.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4177.819s">But</a> I think that Bob, from what I hear, I think the bobcat is, it might be actually too large for sidewalks from what I've heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4184.065s">So,</a> but then again, I mean, like I will definitely admit.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2148.252s">Councilor</a> Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2149.393s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2150.374s">This</a> resolution tonight is to bring additional transparency and to our current process through technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2157.558s">Legislative</a> software is becoming more popular <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2160.175s">It's</a> used in many communities throughout the state of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2163.957s">And</a> there are many benefits to this type of software. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2167.059s">And</a> I know that the city clerk is probably somewhat familiar with the software that's being used. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2172.221s">It</a> simplifies meeting management, saves time and reduced costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2177.044s">It</a> keeps staff and citizens informed, and it promotes accountability. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2181.266s">It</a> truly makes the city clerk's office more efficient, <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2186.177s">As</a> soon as you post the agenda, it goes out online right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2188.859s">The</a> whole community can see it and they can see all the background documents that the public currently doesn't see today. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2195.125s">So</a> any type of background material to the agenda, uh, they would receive that online. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2199.989s">And,</a> uh, there's also the options to add cameras to this as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2203.072s">So</a> we could, if we wanted to, we could, uh, uh, put a camera in the city council, uh, meeting room. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2208.416s">I</a> know, uh, council Lungo had mentioned last week about, uh, filming community committee, the whole meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2214.152s">This</a> would also go for a board and commission meetings as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2217.414s">Uh,</a> they could be filmed and immediately loaded right onto the, uh, city website. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2222.478s">So</a> everyone could actually view and see what's going on, uh, if they can't make it to the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2228.583s">Um,</a> so I think it's worth it to, um, schedule committee, the hall and bring in a number of vendors to actually just show us what options are out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2237.329s">Like</a> I said, I think it makes the process more efficient, but more, uh, important, it makes the process transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2244.44s">And</a> it promotes civic and community engagement, and it just makes government more accessible to the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2251.045s">I</a> actually did sit down with a vendor and did a half-hour demo over the phone, and they walked me through the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2259.29s">It's</a> pretty impressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2260.511s">So</a> I think it's, you know, worth an hour to sit down with a vendor and just see how we can improve the process even more. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2265.274s">And</a> I'd ask that if you could please schedule a committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2268.536s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2272.019s">Citizen</a> — please. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2274.649s">Just</a> to, there are a number of towns, surrounding towns that actually use this. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2279.472s">Melrose</a> uses it, Somerville uses it, Cambridge, Westwood, and I think Framingham, just to name a few. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2285.176s">Some</a> cutting edge places. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2286.657s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2287.297s">So</a> I just think it's something that we should definitely look into.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2303.174s">It</a> depends what option you go with. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2304.654s">And</a> I only talked to one vendor, so I would imagine there's some flexibility to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2309.075s">So</a> I think if you want, it's, I think, up to maybe like $1,000 a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2314.257s">But</a> if you add cameras to it, of course, that's more expensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2317.617s">But</a> that was just one vendor, so I'm sure that's negotiable. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2321.918s">But</a> what it does is, I mean, if you want, everything's on camera. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2326.42s">So</a> if you came up from work tonight just saying you wanted to watch the meeting, you get to your house and it's 8 o'clock, <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2333.155s">You</a> can actually go back and watch it from the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2335.656s">You</a> can just watch a slice of the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2337.757s">You</a> can research through the tool. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2339.538s">If</a> you wanted to see all of the resolutions that Councilor Caraviello has made since he became a councilor, you can go back and look at all that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2347.702s">You</a> can search for anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2351.204s">If</a> you wanted to look at public safety, you could look at every resolution on public safety, and it would pull up all the documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2357.227s">So</a> it's a good way for the citizens to be involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2361.463s">It</a> just provides a lot of transparency to what we do.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2373.146s">Yeah,</a> absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2374.506s">Oh,</a> that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2375.346s">So</a> it's nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2376.047s">It's</a> all easily accessible. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2377.247s">And</a> that's really the big bonus to it all. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2380.648s">We</a> don't have to rely on, I know we have some private citizens right now that actually film some of the meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2386.049s">Or</a> actually, they get a disc and put them on YouTube or Facebook. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2390.381s">So</a> we can actually do this, the city should be doing this, and this is something that, this service that we can provide to the community, and it definitely, I think, would help the city clerk as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=2401.155s">So</a> there's a lot of benefits to it, but I think having a vendor come in and actually describe the process of what they do would be beneficial to all of us.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=2941.576s">So</a> at the point where it's been patched, but we're not confident that it's?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=2954.683s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=2955.562s">I</a> mean, I just, um, well, I think that we're hoping that this investigation of the, uh, or evaluation of the roof is, uh, hopefully in a month's time we'll actually give us a good plan as to what we're going to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=2969.008s">And</a> then, um, I'd like to see the ceiling tiles at some point go up soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=2973.07s">I</a> think if you, especially if the, if the roof has been repaired, you know, I, I mean, I'd like to see the ceiling tiles go up just because, I mean, I think if you walk in, <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=2983.835s">I</a> mean, it sends a message. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=2984.816s">I</a> mean, it really sends a message when people come in, especially from out of town, and this is their first, you know, view of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=2991.281s">I</a> mean, it really kind of doesn't send a good signal. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=2993.823s">So,</a> I mean, if the roof's been fixed in certain spots, I'd like to see the tiles go up. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=2999.468s">But</a> as far as the maintenance of the library, if we could get a report back from maybe the building department as far as what is the maintenance plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=3012.042s">Is</a> there any preventive maintenance being done in the building? <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=3014.263s">For</a> instance, I mean the drip, the drains on the roof were a definite issue that caused the leaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=3019.747s">Is</a> someone going up on the roof on a yearly basis, looking at the drains, making sure they're cleaned out? <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=3023.65s">So</a> if we can get some sort of a report back from the building department, uh, just letting us know what they do on a yearly basis or what they do on a monthly basis with regard to maintenance for the building, preventive maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=3035.277s">Uh,</a> I think, uh, that would be, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/gKERczsOYPo&t=3039.171s">a</a> good start as to, uh, if we're going to be possibly putting on a new roof, we need to take a look at how we can maintain that building on a regular basis and conduct preventive maintenance as well.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2001.669s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2002.61s">I</a> want to thank my consular colleague, Mr. Scarpelli, as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2007.805s">The</a> point that I was trying to make earlier was basically that we should hear from the school administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2014.047s">They</a> can give everyone the rundown as to what happened, what time it happened, why they made the decisions they made. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2020.289s">If</a> we're gonna comment on things tonight, it's purely speculation, and that is not safe for anything or anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2027.571s">So</a> therefore, the important thing is, if you have questions, I think, please, I urge everyone, go to Medford High School tomorrow night, <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2036.107s">at</a> the library, seven o'clock PM, the superintendent's going to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2039.968s">The</a> chief of police is going to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2041.809s">All</a> of the decision makers are going to be in the room and they will be able to go right through the timeline as to what happened and when and why they made the decisions they made. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2049.391s">And</a> that's what I was trying to put point, uh, put across. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2053.012s">I</a> mean, I am a parent of three children in the method public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2056.472s">I</a> mean, I completely understand, um, you know, the notification issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2060.233s">I</a> mean, I have the same concerns, but I think that the administration should at least give us the information so we can, <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2066.212s">make</a> decisions and ask good questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2068.113s">So</a> that's the point I was trying to get across. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2070.215s">Uh,</a> thank you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2516.398s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2517.038s">And</a> this is the point I guess I was getting at before. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2520.18s">I</a> feel like we're speculating as to what happened and when, and I'm not trying to censor anyone, but what I'm trying to say is I think it's best that we have the decision makers present so they can, so they can be asked the questions by the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2534.226s">People</a> have questions, but there's no one here at this meeting that can answer any of the questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2538.908s">That's</a> what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2539.808s">There's,</a> I mean, to me, I understand the concerns about communication, <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2544.359s">I'm</a> completely on board with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2545.879s">But</a> there is no one here tonight that can answer any questions with regard to what happened, when, and what they did, and why. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2552.781s">And</a> those are the key questions that need to be answered tomorrow night. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2556.363s">Once</a> again, Medford High School, 7 PM, the library at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2560.604s">And</a> I believe all the questions will be answered and everyone that should attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=2566.325s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3265.157s">I</a> would like to hear from the school committee first. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3268.138s">I</a> hear from the residents, and I think <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3270.253s">it's</a> great that they came and they, they, they spoke up on the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3273.154s">And,</a> uh, but at this point, I'd like to make, like to make a motion to table. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3277.335s">I</a> think we need to hear from the school committee and what they hear about what went wrong and what we need, what needs to be done to improve the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3284.357s">What</a> would, what did we need to hear from law enforcement? <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3286.818s">We</a> need to hear from the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3288.038s">Like</a> I said, we need to hear from the decision makers before we make a decision here. <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=3291.719s">So</a> I'd like to make a motion to table.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mnqErCY2Ajc&t=4301.507s">I</a> actually have an adjustment to the records.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Uzv1sDn-Dz8&t=3200.648s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Uzv1sDn-Dz8&t=3201.449s">I</a> have a quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Uzv1sDn-Dz8&t=3202.289s">I'm</a> not sure if you know the answer to this, but do we know when the bollards were approved?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Uzv1sDn-Dz8&t=3207.473s">And</a> that's prior to me being elected, so I'm just kind of just.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Uzv1sDn-Dz8&t=3221.585s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Uzv1sDn-Dz8&t=3225.605s">Do</a> we know who's responsible for installing those? <a href="https://youtu.be/Uzv1sDn-Dz8&t=3227.626s">Do</a> we know why they haven't been installed? <a href="https://youtu.be/Uzv1sDn-Dz8&t=3229.147s">Do</a> we know if we paid for them and they've just never been installed? <a href="https://youtu.be/Uzv1sDn-Dz8&t=3232.549s">These</a> are questions that I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/Uzv1sDn-Dz8&t=3233.69s">I'm</a> kind of curious. <a href="https://youtu.be/Uzv1sDn-Dz8&t=3235.37s">A</a> whole year has gone by.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Uzv1sDn-Dz8&t=3243.075s">I</a> was down in the neighborhood last night and Councilor Caraviello was there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Uzv1sDn-Dz8&t=3249.71s">And</a> we noticed there were two bollards that were installed in the corner of Harvard and Maine. <a href="https://youtu.be/Uzv1sDn-Dz8&t=3254.111s">Do</a> we know when those were installed?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Uzv1sDn-Dz8&t=3271.635s">And</a> those aren't really doing the job because <a href="https://youtu.be/Uzv1sDn-Dz8&t=3274.948s">There's</a> still, I've seen the pictures, all four wheels of these trucks are on top of the sidewalk, which is completely, does not make any sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/Uzv1sDn-Dz8&t=3283.831s">So,</a> and the Council Member Marks had mentioned it before, it really sounds like we need to install bollards up a good portion of Harvard Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/Uzv1sDn-Dz8&t=3292.734s">So,</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/Uzv1sDn-Dz8&t=3294.055s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Uzv1sDn-Dz8&t=4207.374s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Uzv1sDn-Dz8&t=4208.455s">Um,</a> this, this resolution is about, uh, you know, government being open and more transparent to our residents in, and also just making government more accessible in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/Uzv1sDn-Dz8&t=4217.843s">Um,</a> and I have to say when I first wrote this resolution last, uh, Thursday, <a href="https://youtu.be/Uzv1sDn-Dz8&t=4222.853s">and</a> sent it to the city clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/Uzv1sDn-Dz8&t=4224.294s">I</a> did some research on the city website and I couldn't find any information on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Uzv1sDn-Dz8&t=4229.378s">And</a> it's great, every week we receive, I don't know, at least 10 notices of open meetings and they're important. <a href="https://youtu.be/Uzv1sDn-Dz8&t=4236.883s">And</a> I think the public should be encouraged to attend and be involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/Uzv1sDn-Dz8&t=4242.327s">But</a> last night as I was preparing for our meeting, I went back onto the city website and I noticed the city actually has a city calendar now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Uzv1sDn-Dz8&t=4250.073s">And</a> actually when it came online, I'm guessing, <a href="https://youtu.be/Uzv1sDn-Dz8&t=4253.399s">over</a> maybe the past couple of days, but when I first wrote the resolution, it wasn't there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Uzv1sDn-Dz8&t=4258.503s">So,</a> but it's—I give the administration a lot of credit. <a href="https://youtu.be/Uzv1sDn-Dz8&t=4262.125s">I</a> think it's heading in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/Uzv1sDn-Dz8&t=4264.267s">It's</a> nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/Uzv1sDn-Dz8&t=4265.007s">You</a> click on the meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/Uzv1sDn-Dz8&t=4265.908s">You</a> get a link. <a href="https://youtu.be/Uzv1sDn-Dz8&t=4267.989s">But</a> what I didn't—what I noticed is not all meetings are posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/Uzv1sDn-Dz8&t=4273.053s">So</a> that's why my resolution is basically to require. <a href="https://youtu.be/Uzv1sDn-Dz8&t=4276.773s">that</a> all of them, all of the, uh, boarding commission meetings be posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/Uzv1sDn-Dz8&t=4280.195s">Uh,</a> I think they should require an agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/Uzv1sDn-Dz8&t=4282.757s">And</a> if I could, um, amend the resolution to require that the minutes be, uh, also posted, uh, once the meeting is, uh, has been completed, it's important that, you know, we involve our citizens and they, you know, have the right to go to a website, go to the city website. <a href="https://youtu.be/Uzv1sDn-Dz8&t=4296.546s">And</a> if they, they can see a list of meetings for the month, if they want to attend things, great. <a href="https://youtu.be/Uzv1sDn-Dz8&t=4301.249s">If</a> they don't, at least when they, or if they can't at least, <a href="https://youtu.be/Uzv1sDn-Dz8&t=4304.188s">At</a> the conclusion of the meeting, if the minutes are there, you know, they can actually see what happened during the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Uzv1sDn-Dz8&t=4309.012s">And</a> I think it's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/Uzv1sDn-Dz8&t=4310.133s">So,</a> um, if I could amend that to, um, if you can amend that to, uh, require the minutes as well, uh, that'd be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/Uzv1sDn-Dz8&t=4317.518s">And,</a> uh, I move for a motion of approval as amended council night.

Well, then can the whole committee, I guess, receive a copy? <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6430.012s">Because</a> it would be nice to actually see something in writing as to what the rules of engagement with regard to the work that's being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6438.879s">I</a> mean, it seems like it's kind of everyone's a little bit all over the place with regard to when it's supposed to start, when it's supposed to stop, you know, exactly what's happening down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6446.425s">So</a> if we could get some sort of communication <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6449.2s">I'm</a> not sure if it's the engineering department or what, but if you could get something with the agreement between the DOT and the city with regard to how everything is supposed to work with regard to the replacement of the Craddock Bridge.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_WZBDDeqA2qI/2025-03-21_WZBDDeqA2qI.html">Medford, MA City Council - Jan. 19, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=3941.858s">So</a> we need to hear from them. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=3943.018s">So</a> as far as the stops go then, how many kids are getting off at that stop at Myrtle and the Fells White? <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=3949.842s">Do</a> we know?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=3967.19s">But</a> what about, so if you go from Salem Street to the Fellows Way, Salem Street to Fulton Street, which is a pretty significant stretch, I mean, I would imagine you have an abundance of kids there that get off, that live anywhere up in the Fulton Heights area and down towards the Salem Street area. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=3987.003s">I</a> mean, is there any consideration that's being made for those children? <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=3991.386s">I</a> mean, especially, I mean, I would think, <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=3995.255s">I</a> mean, it can be tough for anyone to cross. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=3996.696s">I</a> mean, I cross there every day and I'm 45 years old and it can be an issue on some days. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4002.763s">But</a> I'm looking at kids that are in elementary school. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4005.686s">I</a> mean, that's a major concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4006.947s">I</a> mean, I've got a call from a few parents that <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4009.467s">You</a> know, really, I mean, there's some concerns there that, I mean, crossing there is a major issue and, you know, it'd be nice to have some sort of coverage between that Salem Street and Fulton Street, you know, stretch.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4037.688s">So</a> the elementary schools are, when they get off the bus, they're staying on the side that they get off the bus.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3682.659s">One</a> of the information is to Scarpelli.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3694.839s">Okay,</a> and if we could have the cost from the surrounding district before we vote on this, that'd be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3699.862s">There's</a> a few more, I believe Mrs. Cunha had a question, and Mrs. DiBenedetto, Mrs. Cunha.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5325.909s">Any</a> other questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5328.211s">If</a> I may. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5328.851s">Motion</a> to accept the paper, please, on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5330.773s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5330.993s">OK,</a> on the motion of Mrs. Carey to accept the paper, please, on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5335.616s">Seconded</a> by Mrs. D.

 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5342.368s">Has</a> every teacher been trained that's in the K-5?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5401.778s">And</a> that's my next question. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5402.699s">The</a> technology that goes with the program, from what I remember, there was an online component that you could use at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5409.284s">Am</a> I correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5410.505s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5410.825s">So</a> do the parents or have the students been given all of their login information to use that?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5439.805s">If</a> a parent needs login information, do they contact the classroom teacher? <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5444.467s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5446.429s">Last</a> but not least, you had mentioned under textbooks about funding one classroom, set up K-5 divisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5454.235s">Is</a> that for a particular school or is that spread?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5500.305s">Okay,</a> perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5501.005s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5502.427s">Any</a> other questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5505.07s">Mrs.</a> Cuno.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5793.849s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5794.009s">And</a> the motion was too scary. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5794.99s">Seconded</a> by Mrs. D Benedetto that the pre-budget report on mathematics be accepted in place on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5800.135s">All</a> those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5800.976s">All</a> those opposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5802.197s">The</a> report is accepted in place on file.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5807.623s">Next</a> item is the health. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5809.365s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5809.805s">The</a> pre-budget report on health and physical education.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=6656.701s">Mr.</a> Scarpella.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=6901.798s">Mrs.</a> DiBenedetto.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7184.069s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7185.992s">Mrs.</a> Cunha.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7483.012s">All</a> right, thank you for your report, very thorough. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7484.853s">I</a> just had a quick question, well, statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7487.575s">First</a> of all, I'm really happy to see that in your goals and objectives that you're incorporating the pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7492.138s">It's</a> fabulous, I mean, it's a great facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7494.519s">Not</a> all cities and towns have a facility like this, and it's great to see that we're using it. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7499.723s">One</a> of the things I was wondering is, have we ever done any type of poll, got to the high school students, and how many kids know how to swim? <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7508.208s">Because</a> we actually haven't had a pool in a while, so I'm thinking, you know, there could be a group of people out there that just don't know how to swim. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7514.155s">I</a> think it's something that should look into just a swimming class in general, how to swim, especially because you hear each year how so many kids...
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7542.337s">Mr.</a> Scott probably touched on it earlier, the maintenance of equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7545.177s">So</a> with regard to that budget line item, is that <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7548.953s">Is</a> that inclusive of the fitness center or is that just equipment outside of the fitness center? <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7553.442s">It's</a> both. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7554.284s">It's</a> both. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7555.145s">And</a> with regard to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7557.257s">The</a> fitness center in general, is the equipment in kind of shape? <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7560.278s">Are</a> we in pretty good shape still?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7614.942s">Okay,</a> on the motion of Mr. Skerry to approve the pre-budget report on health and PE in place on file, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7620.564s">All</a> right, opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7621.945s">The</a> report is accepted. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7623.485s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7624.606s">Next</a> item is the pre-budget report on ELL, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7632.248s">Last</a> but not, certainly not least.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=8491.824s">Mrs.</a> Cuno.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=8541.99s">Okay,</a> on the motion of Mr. Secretary and seconded by Mrs. DiBenedetto to accept the pre-budget report on ELL and place on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=8548.396s">All</a> those in favor?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=8549.777s">Opposed?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=8550.157s">The</a> report is accepted and placed on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=8551.919s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=8554.061s">Next</a> item, report on summer programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=8556.363s">Mr.</a> Superintendent.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9090.439s">Point</a> of information, Mrs. Cuno.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9178.037s">And</a> also, if I could just mention really quick too, it gives, I think, by moving up to the high school, it also gives the Columbus the opportunity to be properly maintained during the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9187.841s">Because</a> if it's not, I mean, if you have the program at the Columbus, you really, there's minimal time to get that school back in shape before it's online again for the school year.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9251.408s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9251.708s">Mrs.</a> DiBenedetto.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9546.445s">Mrs.</a> Cuno.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9715.059s">I</a> just wanted to, actually, I can tell you it's a fine program. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9724.165s">My</a> kids actually go to the summertime fun program. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9726.146s">They</a> have a great time every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9727.727s">They</a> really enjoy it. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9728.928s">Can't</a> beat the cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9730.028s">And</a> they have a lot of fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9731.509s">And</a> they've met a lot of friends through it as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9733.931s">As</a> far as, so at the end of the summer, do we do any type of, <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9740.912s">Do</a> you do any type of communication with parents just to get their evaluation of how they felt the camp was? <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9745.639s">I</a> think that would be interesting to see if there's anything that we can add, anything we can do differently.
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9756.008s">I</a> think it'd be nice to reach out to the parents to actually see if there are ways to improve. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9779.073s">It's</a> already a great program, but it's good to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9781.615s">And</a> actually, would it be possible at the end of the summer, actually probably in September, just to get like a follow-up report on each of these programs, just to see, just update us on the good things or if there's anything that needs to be addressed?
 <p>[John Falco]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9797.612s">Any</a> other questions from the committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9799.853s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9800.813s">You're</a> welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9801.394s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9801.774s">You're</a> welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9802.434s">Seconded</a> by Mr. Scarpelli that the report on summer programs be accepted and placed on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9807.696s">All</a> those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9808.396s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9808.536s">All</a> those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9809.056s">The</a> report is accepted and placed on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9811.077s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9813.938s">Negotiations</a> on legal matters, done. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9816.118s">All</a> business, done. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9817.939s">Communications,</a> done. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9819.4s">Under</a> new business. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9821.642s">We</a> resolve that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Robert Delfino. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9827.533s">Mr.</a> Delfino was a former city assessor. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9831.061s">Be</a> it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Gerald Eisenhower. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9837.306s">Mr.</a> Eisenhower was the father of bed supervisor Joan Bowen. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9841.249s">Be</a> it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Anne DiBenedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9847.373s">Mrs.</a> DiBenedetto is a sister-in-law of school committee member Erin DiBenedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9852.197s">Be</a> it resolved that the Methodist School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of John Jack Regan. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9858.745s">Mr.</a> Regan was a former teacher, coach, and athletic director. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9863.13s">He</a> was the father of Teacher Joan Cavalier. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9866.014s">We</a> all please rise for a moment of silence. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9886.458s">Mr.</a> Superintendent, I believe you have a few announcements?
