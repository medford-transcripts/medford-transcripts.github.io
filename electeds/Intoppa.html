    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6909.878s">[Intoppa]</a>: Awesome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6910.219s">[Intoppa]</a>: I just want to say thank you very much, Director Fee for presenting all this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6915.06s">[Intoppa]</a>: I just want to also say that I have the distinct pleasure of working at an art institution and being a graduate of an art institution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6922.363s">[Intoppa]</a>: And by doing that, I get to see what everyone from around the state and around the country is producing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6929.425s">[Intoppa]</a>: Watching our Studio Foundation students go through the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6932.166s">[Intoppa]</a>: the system, working with students all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6935.147s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I can comfortably say I think for the first time that Medford is excelling in the arts and I'm really, really pleased to see all the work that's presented, I mean these are just the award winners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6945.131s">[Intoppa]</a>: We don't know what people are crafting personally what's in their full portfolios, and just, it's really refreshing to see this much attention to the arts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6954.774s">[Intoppa]</a>: and seeing how many people were involved in the level that they're at, at grade 10, grade 11, seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6960.618s">[Intoppa]</a>: So whether or not they pursue to do an art education, which I know some of the winners are, but I just want to say like, this is phenomenal work and thank you and congratulations to everyone who won an award and hopefully we'll see what you do next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6974.246s">[Intoppa]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=4709.946s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes, thank you miss Bowen for this report I just had a quick question just because it's my first time sitting on this committee or these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=4716.694s">[Intoppa]</a>: So the ones that are partially implemented in terms of trends in the past years, is this something that is abnormal normal that were partially implemented in these areas, or just curious to see if there's a trend going on of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=4731.334s">[Intoppa]</a>: missing the same things or are we or is this all new, so it's all new information that Jesse was looking at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=4766.639s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah I just want to make sure yeah because these things you know like I understand there's a lot but these are sort of things that we need to make sure that we are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=4773.202s">[Intoppa]</a>: fully implemented all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=4774.786s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I just wanted, I was just curious to see if this is something historically the district has lacked on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=1170.45s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=1193.842s">[Intoppa]</a>: So moved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5025.999s">[Intoppa]</a>: And thank you everyone for giving this valuable information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5028.82s">[Intoppa]</a>: I think, you know, from what it sounds like the city, your program is a phenomenal program to help, you know, professionally develop students, you know, at a time in their life after high school, uh, my initial concern was about the funding portion, but the a hundred thousand or the 200,000 and, you know, scraping from revolving funds or from the before and after school program, because I know we're still, we're, it's on the agenda tonight to talk about the budget and we're, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5053.885s">[Intoppa]</a>: It's not ideal what we're doing in the budget, and we're trying to fit in a $100,000, possibly $200,000 program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5060.612s">[Intoppa]</a>: that I don't know if spend budgeted for in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5063.733s">[Intoppa]</a>: And that part sort of just concerns me a little bit, I guess, to put it out there before we vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5070.815s">[Intoppa]</a>: And also, is this vote to start negotiations, to start talks, or is this vote to approve the actual program?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5079.877s">[Intoppa]</a>: Because while it seems like an amazing program, and from what I could tell, it really is, I just have concerns about bringing it in a time<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5086.619s">[Intoppa]</a>: where we're doing layoffs and scraping revolving funds to just get by for a level service, and we're trying to introduce more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5095.702s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I'm sorry to be so negative about that, but that's just sort of where my concerns are at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6446.996s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6449.298s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6451.259s">[Intoppa]</a>: Abstain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6638.137s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7542.342s">[Intoppa]</a>: I second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7576.812s">[Intoppa]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8105.436s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you vice chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8106.777s">[Intoppa]</a>: Graham Jerry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8108.138s">[Intoppa]</a>: I just want to take a moment and make a few thank yous 1 for creating this detailed report and giving a history lesson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8115.224s">[Intoppa]</a>: So that someone who missed everything and may have been like, wait, what happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8119.307s">[Intoppa]</a>: And, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8120.928s">[Intoppa]</a>: This tells the story of what happened and sort of what's been going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8126.412s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I really want to thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8127.913s">[Intoppa]</a>: I was actually talking to someone the other day about transparency and with budgeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8131.936s">[Intoppa]</a>: And they were like, well, is it going up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8133.237s">[Intoppa]</a>: Is transparency going down?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8134.158s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'm like, it seems like it's going up with the packet I just received.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8137.941s">[Intoppa]</a>: We're getting all this information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8139.422s">[Intoppa]</a>: And that's conversations on record, all these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8142.424s">[Intoppa]</a>: So just thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8143.705s">[Intoppa]</a>: And to also hear that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8145.947s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah, of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8146.888s">[Intoppa]</a>: I also want to say, as I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8149.963s">[Intoppa]</a>: I don't want to sound nonchalant when I talk about cuts, but I do want to acknowledge that these are people's lives and positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8154.926s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I don't want it to seem so casual when I, when we discuss this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8159.448s">[Intoppa]</a>: Um, so I want to acknowledge that and all the people who made their voices heard, but Jerry, just a quick question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8164.45s">[Intoppa]</a>: So in here with page 13, it talks about adding back positions that were cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8171.894s">[Intoppa]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8178.283s">[Intoppa]</a>: So the, and maybe I just misread.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8180.544s">[Intoppa]</a>: So this is why, this is why we asked the questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8183.325s">[Intoppa]</a>: Um, so the performing arts director, the assistant director of athletics, are those all positions now funded through the budget because they're not listed here anymore?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8225.737s">[Intoppa]</a>: So the director of performing arts is still is still out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8230.36s">[Intoppa]</a>: Understood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8230.921s">[Intoppa]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8233.183s">[Intoppa]</a>: Um, just wanted to double check because as much as I just talked about transparency, that just wasn't clear and wanted to double check with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8239.787s">[Intoppa]</a>: Um, I think at this moment, that's all I have, but if another question arise, I will let it be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9871.38s">[Intoppa]</a>: I was hoping to possibly make an amendment to also add into the language to find a way to increase the stipend pay for the band director with the idea that the pay that it is at may not be attractive to external candidates and that there will be a significant decline in the program's activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9893.956s">[Intoppa]</a>: Is it contractual?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9898.579s">[Intoppa]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9899.44s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9984.142s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9985.282s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you for the clarity, Vice Chair Grammich.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9986.963s">[Intoppa]</a>: I could actually<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9988.384s">[Intoppa]</a>: make an, I don't know if this is an amendment making an amendment, if Member Rousseau is making the amendment herself, if I could second the amendment to increase funds available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9999.892s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes, I would be willing to adapt that language, amend my amendment to amend to that language for the amendment of your motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10008.038s">[Intoppa]</a>: So be it there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11609.579s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11643.982s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11659.436s">[Intoppa]</a>: So moved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11684.147s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2959.409s">[Intoppa]</a>: Member Intapa?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2960.93s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2961.571s">[Intoppa]</a>: This probably isn't an important question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2963.953s">[Intoppa]</a>: This is just me being curious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2965.254s">[Intoppa]</a>: What CAD program are they teaching the kids?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2967.436s">[Intoppa]</a>: Are they teaching them SolidWorks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2969.178s">[Intoppa]</a>: I have no idea what the name of the program is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2970.759s">[Intoppa]</a>: Because it looks like the program that I was taught in college.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2973.862s">[Intoppa]</a>: So the fact that we're teaching these students such a, I mean, like it might not be, but it looks just like that program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2981.889s">[Intoppa]</a>: I use it at a college level and at an industry level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2984.471s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I just want to...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3004.395s">[Intoppa]</a>: I wish I had that when I was, like, that's crazy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3009.278s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3009.678s">[Intoppa]</a>: That's the only time you can get, but it's... I wanted to take that, I'm sorry, my mic is echoing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3015.703s">[Intoppa]</a>: everywhere um i'll speak softer um i just want to echo how great that is um because again like this is these are this is the time to learn these programs and you know it'll excel the future um through that so that i just wanted to send my regards is awesome thank you great thank you very much<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10442.964s">[Intoppa]</a>: Point of clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10444.264s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10444.664s">[Intoppa]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10445.085s">[Intoppa]</a>: Point of clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10446.165s">[Intoppa]</a>: My sincerest condolences to the family of Robin Irving, who was a McGlynn Middle School educator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10455.489s">[Intoppa]</a>: Just wanted to point that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10456.93s">[Intoppa]</a>: I also just wanted to say real quickly, because I know some of his family might be on the call and as a representative of the class of 2019, just really echo my sincere condolences to the family of Wade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10470.444s">[Intoppa]</a>: I've been trying to figure out how to really feel about this whole situation as we've all seen it play out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10478.857s">[Intoppa]</a>: But I wanted to just tell a quick story because I feel like it's an important message.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10482.563s">[Intoppa]</a>: I know it's late, but I'll make it quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10485.808s">[Intoppa]</a>: When the class lost a Pervative Coda in 2019, we were all extremely grief-stricken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10493.676s">[Intoppa]</a>: And about two years later, Wade actually reached out to me because he had known me working on scholarship.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10500.602s">[Intoppa]</a>: And he was like, hey, man, I'm sorry to bother you on your personal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10503.685s">[Intoppa]</a>: I was like, it's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10504.446s">[Intoppa]</a>: You can always reach out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10506.248s">[Intoppa]</a>: And he was like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10508.024s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'm really, you know, I was really close with him and I really wanted to do something for him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10512.932s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I don't know what to do, but I really want to do this thing that as a man of faith, he wanted to do a proxy baptism.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10521.537s">[Intoppa]</a>: And he had said, you know, but I really want to make sure I do this right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10525.22s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I really want to make sure that I go through the proper channels and I talk with the family because, you know, I could go to their door if I wanted to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10532.225s">[Intoppa]</a>: But, you know, I don't I don't want to do this right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10536.468s">[Intoppa]</a>: And so we talked with the family and we we got their approval and he went through with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10543.232s">[Intoppa]</a>: He was able to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10545.594s">[Intoppa]</a>: But, you know, something that Wade really stood for, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10549.474s">[Intoppa]</a>: making sure we care for and consider for and love one another even when no one is looking because he didn't have to do that but he did and he made sure that he was at peace and the family was at peace through no incidentals and i really just employ everyone listening that as we sort of navigate this grief to use the power of community and to check in on one another<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10575.925s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I implore you all to text or reach out to in any way that you can, however you feel like you can, to someone you haven't talked to in a while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10586.209s">[Intoppa]</a>: And to just really, really build that sense of community through what we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10591.45s">[Intoppa]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7177.78s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7231.067s">[Intoppa]</a>: Hello?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7236.371s">[Intoppa]</a>: Is this still feedbacking?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7237.652s">[Intoppa]</a>: No, we're good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10533.596s">[Intoppa]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11190.121s">[Intoppa]</a>: I sort of piggyback, thank you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11192.562s">[Intoppa]</a>: I also piggyback the comments of my peers surrounding the MCAS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11196.543s">[Intoppa]</a>: I used to be joked about that I was gonna run for school committee when I was at the Missatuck because I was so against the MCAS and it's actually my grandfather who was a long time educator in Wilmington retired early because of this becoming a requirement for graduation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11213.808s">[Intoppa]</a>: I've also heard horror stories of students who were capable and were great students, but you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11219.844s">[Intoppa]</a>: due to whatever, you know, it's an equity issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11221.886s">[Intoppa]</a>: It's a quality issue of accessibility and they could not, almost did not graduate because of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11229.391s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I am very much in support of that first question, 100% of, not to, I mean, I was able to afford higher education because of the MCAS because I was able to get a scholarship because of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11240.4s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I'm very fortunate and privileged that that was a thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11244.443s">[Intoppa]</a>: So yes, the unfortunate misconception that we're just getting rid of it and like, what happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11248.966s">[Intoppa]</a>: if we get rid of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11250.307s">[Intoppa]</a>: We're just getting rid of it as a requirement to move on to higher education or wherever you may want to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11257.43s">[Intoppa]</a>: So for question two, I'm a huge, huge supporter of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11260.651s">[Intoppa]</a>: So yeah, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2274.713s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2279.977s">[Intoppa]</a>: And thank you, Mayor, for also the clarification on the possible, the fact that we just still don't know what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2288.745s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I find that deeply unsettling, and we gotta figure that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2292.548s">[Intoppa]</a>: My questions with the data presented, do we know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2297.572s">[Intoppa]</a>: It's listed here, the Medford High Complex is listed as one item line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2301.296s">[Intoppa]</a>: Do we know the breakdown of faucets or fixtures, I guess is the better phrase, that are impacted in the high school versus the vocational buildings?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2313.19s">[Intoppa]</a>: Do we know the proportional difference between the two if one was more impacted than the other?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2325.252s">[Intoppa]</a>: Okay, no, that was just one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2336.525s">[Intoppa]</a>: OK, cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2337.326s">[Intoppa]</a>: No, I just wanted a clarification on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2338.866s">[Intoppa]</a>: And then also curious as to why, looking at the numbers again, why the two middle schools with the Andrews being impacted the most with above 15 parts per billion with 52 fixtures affected and the McGlynn Middle School with 33.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2358.411s">[Intoppa]</a>: I guess that has to go with the investigation when it comes to why it's happening and what it's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2363.913s">[Intoppa]</a>: But that is a stark number and difference compared to the rest of our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2371.937s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I'm not sure what that says for the data, but I just want to make a comment about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2375.998s">[Intoppa]</a>: And then in terms of turnaround with data, do we know what the appropriate time is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2380.28s">[Intoppa]</a>: Because the last number I saw was June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2383.117s">[Intoppa]</a>: Do we know when the turnaround is for when we should be getting this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2386.642s">[Intoppa]</a>: Like when we do testing, how long does it take to usually get results back?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2401.784s">[Intoppa]</a>: Sounds good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2403.706s">[Intoppa]</a>: I think that's all I have, but just wanted to thank MassDV for doing this great work and for helping us figure this all out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2412.072s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah, that's all I have to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2413.233s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>
