    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=121.04s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=124.401s">[Intoppa]</a>: I don't know what's going off my mic again, but I'm here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=241.101s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=244.903s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3540.459s">[Intoppa]</a>: Of course I am.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3545.001s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'm also just noticing another error in the minutes, so I'm gonna abstain from this one, which might be the same thing that, I'm sorry, clarification, Member Reinfeld, are you mentioning the vote on the stabilization fund?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3562.27s">[Intoppa]</a>: Okay, so yeah, so as amended, then yes, I vote to approve, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4269.244s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4272.107s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes, with thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4327.758s">[Intoppa]</a>: Motion for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4413.606s">[Intoppa]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6390.369s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you very much Chair Lungo-Koehn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6396.392s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah I just wanted to put this motion forward to sort of recognize and also I guess more amend our current calendar so I know we have we take a vote in November to put forward days of observance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6408.58s">[Intoppa]</a>: I also want to clarify<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6410.185s">[Intoppa]</a>: This is not a day off holiday I'm looking to put forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6413.147s">[Intoppa]</a>: It is more of a day of observance, day of acknowledgement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6416.71s">[Intoppa]</a>: Currently as it stands, the last calendar I had checked, it is referred to as Autism Awareness Day, Autism Awareness Month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6424.636s">[Intoppa]</a>: And this motion looks to amend that and to change that language, whether it has to get tabled till November or if we can do it right now, which would be preferable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6433.943s">[Intoppa]</a>: So it's where it's already labeled and where it needs to be changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6440.663s">[Intoppa]</a>: The third part of the motion, the clarification about identifying students is how we're looking at how we are screening, screening techniques, as well as looking at ways that parents can come to us as a district to look at receiving services, however, they may need it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6462.592s">[Intoppa]</a>: This is something that I would like in writing and to sort of get a report on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6465.774s">[Intoppa]</a>: I have a personal, this comes from a, and the explanation kind of talks about it, of looking at how we make change and how we are impacted as a former student in the Medford Public Schools with an IEP who belongs in the neurodivergent community on the spectrum of the attention deficit disorder spectrum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6487.623s">[Intoppa]</a>: This is something that I witnessed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6490.359s">[Intoppa]</a>: I witnessed students who had 504s and IEPs, their struggles, how some of them would lose them because they were doing better, which to me makes no sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6500.322s">[Intoppa]</a>: Because if you're doing better on a plan, you're doing better because of the plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6504.022s">[Intoppa]</a>: It helps you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6506.163s">[Intoppa]</a>: So, I'm really looking to see what we are doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6509.284s">[Intoppa]</a>: And this is sort of the 1st kind of steps and looking at how we as a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6515.222s">[Intoppa]</a>: can become allies within the autistic community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6517.803s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'd like to make another point of, um, the use of disorder, um, uh, is not so popular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6524.906s">[Intoppa]</a>: And my apologies for using the official language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6527.867s">[Intoppa]</a>: Um, but also, um, you know, this really, really comes from, um, my personal experience working with those, um, within the autistic community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6537.611s">[Intoppa]</a>: Um, as my buddy Dan puts it best, it's pretty easy for me to make you aware that I have autism and that usually proceeds to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6544.868s">[Intoppa]</a>: But it's really hard for members of the community to accept me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6549.051s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I would like to mitigate that harm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6552.833s">[Intoppa]</a>: We're talking at a higher education level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6554.934s">[Intoppa]</a>: Mitigate the harmful effects that this has on our students before they even get there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6560.998s">[Intoppa]</a>: And as someone who's been looked at funny and scrutinized because of my diagnosis, this is my way of putting steps forward for better allyship.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6572.994s">[Intoppa]</a>: But we also want to look at the success.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6574.895s">[Intoppa]</a>: We want to look more at the success, not so much as a disease needs to be healed, as mentioned in the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6581.718s">[Intoppa]</a>: But I feel like we can't do that until we look at how we are helping and how we are aiding the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6587.861s">[Intoppa]</a>: So that is all I have on the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6722.801s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah, I think, thank you, Dr. Edward Vincent for bringing to your concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6728.565s">[Intoppa]</a>: I think that's what I'm just looking to see is what are the procedures we have to follow?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6735.409s">[Intoppa]</a>: That's really, I'm sorry if the phrasing is, this is my first motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6739.912s">[Intoppa]</a>: My apologies if the phrasing is weird.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6742.947s">[Intoppa]</a>: But yeah, I'm looking to see what protocols are from DESE.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6769.742s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah, that would be good as an amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6771.704s">[Intoppa]</a>: I would say a better method would be reports to the Medford School Committee on steps being taken with the Medford Public Schools to support students on the autism spectrum, due to just recommendations from the community on language surrounding how we address it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6798.464s">[Intoppa]</a>: have a motion to amend the calendar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6799.484s">[Intoppa]</a>: I may.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6799.925s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah Member Reinfeld had their hand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6918.559s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6920.099s">[Intoppa]</a>: That would be great to have that conversation with CPAC as well as bring that to the subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6925.702s">[Intoppa]</a>: And also to answer, sorry, to answer the question at hand of the school's calendars to reach the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6934.866s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes, it would amend it to where it is already written to where that to where days of observance are listed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6942.289s">[Intoppa]</a>: Because it has also been brought point of singling out 1 holiday is a concern, which I fully understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6948.391s">[Intoppa]</a>: So, wherever this would naturally be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6952.153s">[Intoppa]</a>: Written is where we would like to see it amended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6957.068s">[Intoppa]</a>: So yes, all recommendations of amendment are taken into consideration for the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7211.087s">[Intoppa]</a>: Getting it now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7321.665s">[Intoppa]</a>: You should be good to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8916.484s">[Intoppa]</a>: Sorry, the thought was there and then it quickly left.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8919.425s">[Intoppa]</a>: I yield my time to Mr. Guillen if possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8923.848s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'll re-raise when I think of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9366.206s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you Madam Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9367.746s">[Intoppa]</a>: I would just like to, I've realized the point was more on the lines of the question of Member Branley, but I would like to echo the point made by MTA President Guillen, as well as Chair Lungo-Koehn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9384.41s">[Intoppa]</a>: It does feel a little politician heavy, and I would love to see if we do have a non-voting member addition, because again, the guidelines said one, minus, you know, the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9395.956s">[Intoppa]</a>: You know, the 2 being, you know, member Graham and member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9400.639s">[Intoppa]</a>: And this is no, this is with all due respect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9404.281s">[Intoppa]</a>: This is not a shot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9405.642s">[Intoppa]</a>: I want to make that very clear member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9407.363s">[Intoppa]</a>: So it was a very, very intelligent person, especially when it comes to open meeting law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9413.347s">[Intoppa]</a>: I have I use it as a resource for many questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9416.069s">[Intoppa]</a>: It's just a matter of me wanting to have more of our community members who maybe don't have that say that maybe this board would have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9425.177s">[Intoppa]</a>: And including, especially our teachers, whether that be paraprofessionals, whether that be the people who walk those buildings daily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9435.782s">[Intoppa]</a>: Because they will tell you the ins and outs that evolve every single day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9441.745s">[Intoppa]</a>: So, yeah, I would say that, you know, obviously it's 2 different motions, but I would echo the concerns of chair and would probably want to put to get more 4 to 5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9451.786s">[Intoppa]</a>: I don't know what the legality of having teachers that don't live in our district, because from my understanding, we have quite a few teachers who don't live within the Medford Public Schools who may be eligible to want to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9462.631s">[Intoppa]</a>: I don't know the legality of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9464.252s">[Intoppa]</a>: That's just my own ignorance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9466.873s">[Intoppa]</a>: But if we can open up it to having more than one school member, even as a non-voting member, I don't see why we couldn't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9477.318s">[Intoppa]</a>: But I think that's all the collective thought I have right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9482.216s">[Intoppa]</a>: before I just start talking nonsense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9546.716s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9731.802s">[Intoppa]</a>: I don't know what an alternate means, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9733.523s">[Intoppa]</a>: Point of clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9738.281s">[Intoppa]</a>: I think the point is, is that member Graham in presenting was saying about how MSBA may have a cap of a certain amount of the working groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9748.267s">[Intoppa]</a>: The idea was, is that we approve three, and if we need to cut down to one non-voting member, then we look at the pool of who we want to put forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9755.591s">[Intoppa]</a>: The idea is to have three, and if we can have two, then we have two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9758.193s">[Intoppa]</a>: And if we have three, then we can have three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9798.156s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'd second that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9799.397s">[Intoppa]</a>: Could I add on to that in the statement that they should be priority sent to faculty members of the building that is being built?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9815.861s">[Intoppa]</a>: Right, right, from that pool, yes, from the applicant pool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9820.343s">[Intoppa]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9934.041s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9939.283s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10280.56s">[Intoppa]</a>: I will put forward the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5538.364s">[Intoppa]</a>: Hey all, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5539.885s">[Intoppa]</a>: I had a question as well for the previous, well not a question, more of a statement for the previous presentation as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5546.769s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you both for presenting all this really wonderful information as someone who actually holds a bachelor's in art and design education with a design degree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5567.879s">[Intoppa]</a>: as Miss Rowland knows, as I went through the many programs she hosts as well, proud product of, you know, the theater and everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5575.403s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'm going to be guidance over Tony's idea as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5579.044s">[Intoppa]</a>: But just wanted to really echo my, I can't say speechless because I'm talking too much right now, and also apologize I can't be there right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5586.228s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'm coping well with somebody here as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5589.961s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah, I just really want to reading through the slideshow was really happy and also really cool to hear that the band actually needed to be replaced and put in another division.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5598.328s">[Intoppa]</a>: And even then they still did really well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5599.969s">[Intoppa]</a>: So thank you to both for all the work you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5603.172s">[Intoppa]</a>: And yeah, that's all I have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5604.833s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6415.641s">[Intoppa]</a>: Remember, we're mostly the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6419.624s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'm not sure what the motion is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6425.808s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12314.88s">[Intoppa]</a>: Sure, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12316.08s">[Intoppa]</a>: Just a quick question of clarification in the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12319.261s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you, Member Graham, for putting this forward, for seeing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12323.962s">[Intoppa]</a>: So should we motion to amend to invite current and former, also parents, guardians, caregivers as well?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12331.325s">[Intoppa]</a>: Would that be something we need to do or should?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12334.026s">[Intoppa]</a>: I mean, I feel like we should as well for students and staff, but I'm not sure if it's implied in the motion already, if that is the case, but figured I would put that out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12359.426s">[Intoppa]</a>: Oh, awesome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12359.966s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12360.527s">[Intoppa]</a>: I knew it was a it was an open meeting, but I wanted to make sure that the formal invitation was sent to them as well, along with their students, but sorry if it's hard to hear me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5408.163s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5410.065s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you, Jerry, for putting this together and very transparent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5414.029s">[Intoppa]</a>: While I don't agree with, you know, all these cuts that we're doing, I really appreciate being able to see where we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5419.835s">[Intoppa]</a>: There's not a lot of guessing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5420.936s">[Intoppa]</a>: We can actually see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5424.473s">[Intoppa]</a>: I am very new to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5426.235s">[Intoppa]</a>: I've been in two months to the day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5429.137s">[Intoppa]</a>: So my apologies if my ignorance or my lack of understanding precedes what I'm about to sort of talk about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5436.124s">[Intoppa]</a>: It's the only way you can learn it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5437.825s">[Intoppa]</a>: I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5438.245s">[Intoppa]</a>: I dive into the deep end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5440.567s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thought possible two and a half million deficit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5443.31s">[Intoppa]</a>: Now it's 250.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5444.391s">[Intoppa]</a>: Like diving in the deep end real hard right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5447.734s">[Intoppa]</a>: Some emails that I've gotten<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5449.535s">[Intoppa]</a>: in particular are around performing arts, athletics, nurses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5455.499s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I thought, I guess these are more comments than questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5459.721s">[Intoppa]</a>: And again, I wish I knew how to find the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5462.163s">[Intoppa]</a>: I wish I understood that, but I just don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5464.084s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I apologize if I'm not giving too many solutions, just more of the concerns that I have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5469.667s">[Intoppa]</a>: Performing arts is on a decline, and by cutting that, I'm really nervous about the direction we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5475.489s">[Intoppa]</a>: Performing arts aren't just an activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5477.369s">[Intoppa]</a>: It is how we integrate culture, how we keep tradition, how we keep things alive in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5484.231s">[Intoppa]</a>: And, you know, we just had a great performance from our drama club with Mama Mia, and also just some other initiatives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5490.033s">[Intoppa]</a>: You know, we're seeing them give back to the community in ways that, you know, I couldn't even have imagined when I was at Medford High.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5495.934s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I really...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5499.807s">[Intoppa]</a>: You know, we just named the office after, you know, former school committee member, Lita DiGianto-Masso, and I'm afraid by going down this path, we're sort of going back what she was fighting against.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5511.535s">[Intoppa]</a>: You know, the performing arts are a huge staple to how we keep the users of our schools there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5521.461s">[Intoppa]</a>: In terms of, what was I talking about, nurses, I was a student with,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5528.11s">[Intoppa]</a>: medication that had to be stored.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5529.352s">[Intoppa]</a>: And one of the things that I think I am not seeing sort of brought up is also, you know, we cut nurses, we're also cutting the facts that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5536.65s">[Intoppa]</a>: I even in the upper levels could not take my medication without a nurse being there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5542.713s">[Intoppa]</a>: That includes epinephrine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5544.154s">[Intoppa]</a>: If I don't carry an EpiPen on me, there's one stored there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5546.595s">[Intoppa]</a>: We need someone to be able to run around the maze that is Mephiti Complex to find someone who may need to administer it, as well as I need to find time out of my day to go and meet with one of those nurses, hoping there's one not helping another student to take the medication that allowed me to help me learn every single day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5563.123s">[Intoppa]</a>: So that's sort of one of the things that I just wanted to say in support of the nurses here and just wanted to give that insight because I'm not really seeing that being mentioned, but no one really sees that unless they experience it like I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5574.194s">[Intoppa]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5581.922s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5582.532s">[Intoppa]</a>: And it's just, it's not even just the high school, it's the elementary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5584.552s">[Intoppa]</a>: I've been taking medications since elementary school, um, elementary school, middle school and high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5589.513s">[Intoppa]</a>: Um, and so that, that doesn't really change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5591.434s">[Intoppa]</a>: So it was always packed to even back then when I was there in 2019.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5596.455s">[Intoppa]</a>: Um, so I'm really, really concerned about how many, you know, employees were cutting, uh, in terms of athletics, um, that department in terms of it's already thin enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5605.636s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I, I'm not sure what position was cut in the athletics department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5613.299s">[Intoppa]</a>: One of the administrative?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5616.46s">[Intoppa]</a>: Because the assistant athletic director that I know that's in there is like the backbone of that entire athletics department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5622.582s">[Intoppa]</a>: And that is no diss to anyone in that department at all, but the individual who is in that is at everything I've ever been to and is there to make sure that that program stays running.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5640.676s">[Intoppa]</a>: So really looking at, you know, it's numbers but it's also people and support, and who are they going to lean on if they're the ones there all the time anyways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5648.659s">[Intoppa]</a>: And then in terms of, you know, looking at technology spending, we've sort of digged ourselves into this hole of relying on Chromebooks and technology because of the pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5658.716s">[Intoppa]</a>: I guess when it comes to technology, as someone who's used that technology pre-pandemic, knowing how unreliable it can be, I'm a little concerned about pumping more money into it until we figure out a solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5668.419s">[Intoppa]</a>: Because I feel like every other Chromebook had a missing key.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5671.56s">[Intoppa]</a>: And also, I'm a little concerned about putting so much money towards tablets for kindergartners instead of the support that they need to help teach those kindergartners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5687.236s">[Intoppa]</a>: hands-on learning tactile that, I mean, I'm not an educator, but I just happen to be a designer and an artist and know just the value of tactile hands-on learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5696.682s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I would almost rather look, see that money, if that money had to go towards something, be more towards school supplies or hands-on learning than electronics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5704.167s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I don't know how that makes me sound, but I don't feel like our kindergartners need tablets, they need people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5711.112s">[Intoppa]</a>: And so that's a lot of what I have to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5713.193s">[Intoppa]</a>: And there's a lot of things, obviously, you know, I'm happy to see more increase in special education services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5719.517s">[Intoppa]</a>: But there are a lot of alarming factors that I don't know if I fully wrapped my head around in the last 48 hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5726.3s">[Intoppa]</a>: And, you know, thank you to everyone who's here to speak on behalf.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5729.602s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I'm sorry by taking up more of the time that doesn't allow you to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5733.98s">[Intoppa]</a>: I just wanna say that there's, I may have more questions or comments going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5738.304s">[Intoppa]</a>: For now, that's what I have, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5816.839s">[Intoppa]</a>: Right, and I think, I'm sorry, just a point of clarification, I guess on my point, is it to cut technology?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5821.321s">[Intoppa]</a>: It's more to look at and consult our users who are administering it to see where they might find it best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5826.463s">[Intoppa]</a>: Do we need to invest more in technology?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5828.363s">[Intoppa]</a>: I don't have a teaching degree, so I don't really know what that is like, but.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5833.625s">[Intoppa]</a>: definitely leaning more on our professionals that are our faculty to see where there are technological gaps and fixes on a day-to-day classroom basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5841.527s">[Intoppa]</a>: So thank you for the clarification as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5844.108s">[Intoppa]</a>: Again, appreciate the work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=0.393s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes, yep, I will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2.955s">[Intoppa]</a>: OK, we are live on YouTube, and let me record it locally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=8.099s">[Intoppa]</a>: Record to the cloud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=11.141s">[Intoppa]</a>: And make host.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=15.344s">[Intoppa]</a>: All right, have a great meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=16.325s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=18.126s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=64.031s">[Intoppa]</a>: I can read it out for you if you'd like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=72.426s">[Intoppa]</a>: Sure, so the meeting ID is 91810757989, with the Zoom meeting link being mps02155-org.zoom.us, forward slash J, forward slash 918177, 757, sorry, 989.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=805.94s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah, so quick question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=807.101s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I guess it's more of like a point of clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=810.6s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'm assuming this is sort of the point the school council's made up of like students, staff, faculty, is this the point for them to kind of give their feedback on like, we're finding that this isn't working or this like we've noticed this uptake in this and we need to do something about it like is this the community's chance to sort of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=914.79s">[Intoppa]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=914.971s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah, because I guess I'm more thinking about when the users of the handbook can give feedback on what they're seeing made, like when that period would be essential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=925.214s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I wasn't sure if that was the time for it or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1335.228s">[Intoppa]</a>: Could we say singular complete approval, meaning it's a, like, it has to be complete, a complete approval of a singular handbook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1343.551s">[Intoppa]</a>: Could that phrasing just before approval, make sense, or is there like some caveat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1364.334s">[Intoppa]</a>: I guess I mean, singular, complete.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1370.816s">[Intoppa]</a>: By singular, I mean, like, this is the McGlynn handbook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1373.257s">[Intoppa]</a>: This is the Brooks handbook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1374.478s">[Intoppa]</a>: If we approve one of them, that is a singular, complete approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1387.034s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah, that's a good message, really, really good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2938.873s">[Intoppa]</a>: Okay, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2941.514s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thing I have to notice, which is the typo on phase 3.2 mandatory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2953.52s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2954.702s">[Intoppa]</a>: Oh, I googled it just in case I didn't understand linguistics for a second, but member member and Tapa has been finding Dory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2974.787s">[Intoppa]</a>: Google Docs does it automatically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2987.383s">[Intoppa]</a>: I mean, the timeframe seemed logistical to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2989.685s">[Intoppa]</a>: I appreciate the cushion to an RN of like, hey, if these things need to get moved back, ours is significant so that way we're the ones who are kind of paid to do the work and can kind of speed things along if we have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3002.857s">[Intoppa]</a>: But like in my experience of drafting policy and drafting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3007.936s">[Intoppa]</a>: Dates, we did it with elections with our student council and like, it was like, it looked great on paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3013.362s">[Intoppa]</a>: It's like, this makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3014.443s">[Intoppa]</a>: And then they just executed the constitute the new constitution this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3018.146s">[Intoppa]</a>: And it was like, no, we need to, we need to do this a lot earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3020.789s">[Intoppa]</a>: So it'll be something we live and learn that we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3025.594s">[Intoppa]</a>: But logistically, having a month for initiation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3255.519s">[Intoppa]</a>: I don't really have any further questions or comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3512.205s">[Intoppa]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3514.205s">[Intoppa]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3764.85s">[Intoppa]</a>: No, that sounds about right to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3766.211s">[Intoppa]</a>: If it's outside of the time we're dialoguing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3768.293s">[Intoppa]</a>: But no, that does make sense to amend it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3770.675s">[Intoppa]</a>: But right, if this was April 28th, we'd be having a different conversation, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3776.239s">[Intoppa]</a>: In fact, it's May 8th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3777.3s">[Intoppa]</a>: I think we're OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3780.363s">[Intoppa]</a>: That's my sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3783.288s">[Intoppa]</a>: But I didn't even think about that, member Ratcliffe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3785.189s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you for bringing that up, because that would have been fun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3863.684s">[Intoppa]</a>: We just got an email saying that we have them and that physical copies will be given to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3871.672s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah, no, like, like literally 20 minutes ago, we got the three of them, and we will be giving hard copies out for the May 20 meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3915.362s">[Intoppa]</a>: So moved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1790.037s">[Intoppa]</a>: I also just wanted to take a second and just recognize how important this program is to our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1795.8s">[Intoppa]</a>: I actually, unfortunately, only got a chance to be a part of it my senior year in high school, but that was the cohort that witnessed it go to the elementary and middle school level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1804.985s">[Intoppa]</a>: And just seeing how much it's grown in only what I like to say two years, but it's been like five or six now, is absolutely amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1813.349s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I'm so proud of you guys and everyone who's involved to get up here and speak and do what you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1818.872s">[Intoppa]</a>: This program really takes you know when you take a moment and look at students special interests and you look at what they want to do to give back to the community and you fund that and you encourage them to do it, you see such an increase in their overall academic success and their participation in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1836.881s">[Intoppa]</a>: the social emotional learning skills that you get.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1839.802s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I just, I really, you know, seeing what happened and seeing the unfortunate incident that happened and just immediately coming to action and then doing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1847.885s">[Intoppa]</a>: I just, I can't commend you guys enough and I can't wait to see what you guys do next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1852.187s">[Intoppa]</a>: I really can't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1852.887s">[Intoppa]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1853.987s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8696.916s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8698.755s">[Intoppa]</a>: I again, want to just say that my comments are more comments than questions, maybe a little bit of both, but wanted to take the opportunity to sort of give my concerns to also let people know that they are heard because a lot of them are from the many, many emails that we have gotten over the last two to three weeks, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8721.161s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I just want to take a moment and apologize to those who I wasn't able to get to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8724.662s">[Intoppa]</a>: immediately right away but really appreciate you reaching out with your personal experience and things that are going on and your concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8734.491s">[Intoppa]</a>: Again, some of the things, I'm really concerned about us bouncing back and sort of, not bouncing back, really relying on the staffing recommendations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8744.677s">[Intoppa]</a>: I feel like, you know, May is mental health awareness month and we are in a mental health epidemic in crisis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8750.941s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I'm really, really concerned about the amount of nursing, the health cuts, as well as the guidance counselor cuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8757.865s">[Intoppa]</a>: I know there are adjustment counselors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8759.086s">[Intoppa]</a>: I know we still have 17 of those in this proposed budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8762.248s">[Intoppa]</a>: However,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8763.749s">[Intoppa]</a>: The ease of access to students are the nurses, those are the people who if you are having a panic attack, you go right to the nurses, I have done that numerous times at the high school, it is someone where if you don't know where to go, that is a safe haven, and I know the high school still has three, but that's just an example of, you know, later on, however, I worry about the ones that you know the one full time I know there's some sharing going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8786.104s">[Intoppa]</a>: I made the comment at the last meeting and we'll make it again about how one can be a little dangerous, especially when it comes to medication at all levels, you know, you can't be administered education, I mean, you can't be administered medication without a nurse present you can't not give it to yourself, whether you are seven or you are 19 that is just not a possibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8809.065s">[Intoppa]</a>: And so I wanted to really push back on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8812.069s">[Intoppa]</a>: You know, I'm, you know, seeing go from six to four but still really concerned about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8817.295s">[Intoppa]</a>: A lot of my other concerns have already been echoed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8820.679s">[Intoppa]</a>: When it comes to the performing arts I'm really happy to hear that you know there's going to be a stipend position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8825.905s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'm really concerned about a stipend position to fund the marching band and color guard because that is such an intensive program in our education system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8833.847s">[Intoppa]</a>: I was an orchestra kid, so I got to witness firsthand how much, you know, work they put in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8838.708s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I also want to make a comment that I didn't make earlier, but, you know, we made a comment about how many people were repeating and repeatedly standing up with our students, but I want to notice how many of our humanity success stories had a performing arts marching band and color guard garments on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8871.977s">[Intoppa]</a>: It's a lot, it's a lot of work, and I've seen it and I worry that when we start to stipend or we start to do that the work may not be, I don't want to say appealing to someone but it's not enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8884.783s">[Intoppa]</a>: And oftentimes what that happens is it creates a work environment that is too tiring and then people leave and then we don't want people you know that we've had here for 14 years that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8893.467s">[Intoppa]</a>: really love the work, but then can't afford to do the work anymore, so they make that tough decision to leave, and then we can't find someone to replace them because no one wants to do that work for however much money that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8904.398s">[Intoppa]</a>: So those are some of the big concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8905.499s">[Intoppa]</a>: That was a lot of the concerns we had gotten in emails was about the performing arts position directly in the state of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8910.904s">[Intoppa]</a>: I know there was a lot of misinformation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8912.206s">[Intoppa]</a>: I know there was a lot of talk about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8913.807s">[Intoppa]</a>: the performing arts program being slashed or cut entirely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8917.608s">[Intoppa]</a>: But that's one of the main concerns I have as someone who sees that sort of on a day-to-day about, you know, people being underpaid, people wanting to have these ambitions and not being able to fulfill them because of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8928.57s">[Intoppa]</a>: The performing arts, there's a huge, you know, it was actually said in an email that reminded me of the term social-emotional learning and, you know, how the academic access, again, what we just showed, the academic success that our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8941.073s">[Intoppa]</a>: our students have when they are in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8944.575s">[Intoppa]</a>: So that's sort of where my now new concern is with the stipend positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8949.037s">[Intoppa]</a>: I appreciate there's money being put there, however, that condition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8952.9s">[Intoppa]</a>: That also translates to the Missituck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8954.44s">[Intoppa]</a>: I was talking to some of my former teachers, which is crazy to think that, you know, seeing them here today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8960.724s">[Intoppa]</a>: I was reminded by one of my teachers that was pregnant when I had them, and they showed me a photo of their 16-year-old son.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8967.187s">[Intoppa]</a>: And it made me just really, really think back to the time that I was there, and it was the Missittuc, really concerned at the number of positions that's being cut there, especially, you know, a lot of people had said that the class sizes aren't what are as advertised, that we have a lot of staff members really doing the part of their job description that's other duties is assigned, covering for each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8987.018s">[Intoppa]</a>: And how many of our, you know, language learning students<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8992.021s">[Intoppa]</a>: are there and how we are cutting down at a school where we send a lot of people who need maybe extra aid there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8998.285s">[Intoppa]</a>: And so that's a huge concern of mine, and one that I wanted to echo from the thousands of comments and people who are here today to talk about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9007.63s">[Intoppa]</a>: I feel like there's definitely some more comments that have definitely been reshared, so I won't go through some of that, but I just want to, again, thank everyone who's here today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9014.913s">[Intoppa]</a>: And thank you, Jerry, for, again, being transparent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9017.575s">[Intoppa]</a>: I know this isn't easy to do, and I appreciate being able to look at the numbers and see them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9023.7s">[Intoppa]</a>: But those are sort of some of my high-level concerns, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10038.951s">[Intoppa]</a>: Point of clarification before we move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10043.493s">[Intoppa]</a>: Point of clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10044.453s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10045.734s">[Intoppa]</a>: I just wanted to not to stir the pot, but in reference to student members' wrongs with the payroll managerial positions, I think there was some also concern from the union about those usually being administrative assistant roles and then them being non-union.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10059.538s">[Intoppa]</a>: Is that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10060.718s">[Intoppa]</a>: still a proposed effort?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10062.901s">[Intoppa]</a>: I just want to get clarification if that's changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=12369.626s">[Intoppa]</a>: Point of clarification, vice chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=12371.707s">[Intoppa]</a>: Point of clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=12373.948s">[Intoppa]</a>: I know that we made a motion earlier to strike the addresses of our student members in the minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=12379.51s">[Intoppa]</a>: Would it make sense to suspend the rules or make a motion to strike the students who have to speak further to give their address when they speak at the podium for minutes or?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=12395.459s">[Intoppa]</a>: I just want to clarify and make that note to the students that they don't have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=12399.582s">[Intoppa]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=12400.043s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=12400.603s">[Intoppa]</a>: They have your name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18552.759s">[Intoppa]</a>: point of clarification, is this number with all the cuts or without the cuts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18560.465s">[Intoppa]</a>: So this number that we're putting forward is a request to the municipal government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18569.773s">[Intoppa]</a>: It's a request, but it is the first step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18573.516s">[Intoppa]</a>: What I should clarify in my clarification is, is this number, because I'm getting confused with the language again, I'm on the job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18582.362s">[Intoppa]</a>: Is this number one that reflects the cuts in our packet or is this one that is the level one that is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18589.526s">[Intoppa]</a>: This is level service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18590.847s">[Intoppa]</a>: This is level service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18591.788s">[Intoppa]</a>: If we do not, so this does not include the cutting of the director of performing arts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18595.751s">[Intoppa]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18596.751s">[Intoppa]</a>: That's all I would.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18598.012s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18601.213s">[Intoppa]</a>: It's very important to know what we vote on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18605.754s">[Intoppa]</a>: Everyone else understands what we're voting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18607.854s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18608.134s">[Intoppa]</a>: I do not feel comfortable voting on a budget that has this many cuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18611.115s">[Intoppa]</a>: But if this number that we are putting forward, then yes, the bottom number, not the top number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18713.874s">[Intoppa]</a>: Can you turn on your mic?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18714.935s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes, thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18716.897s">[Intoppa]</a>: So point of clarification for the fifth time, recommendation on the consent agenda, we did not vote to recommend to approve the $3,000 grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6909.878s">[Intoppa]</a>: Awesome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6910.219s">[Intoppa]</a>: I just want to say thank you very much, Director Fee for presenting all this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6915.06s">[Intoppa]</a>: I just want to also say that I have the distinct pleasure of working at an art institution and being a graduate of an art institution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6922.363s">[Intoppa]</a>: And by doing that, I get to see what everyone from around the state and around the country is producing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6929.425s">[Intoppa]</a>: Watching our Studio Foundation students go through the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6932.166s">[Intoppa]</a>: the system, working with students all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6935.147s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I can comfortably say I think for the first time that Medford is excelling in the arts and I'm really, really pleased to see all the work that's presented, I mean these are just the award winners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6945.131s">[Intoppa]</a>: We don't know what people are crafting personally what's in their full portfolios, and just, it's really refreshing to see this much attention to the arts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6954.774s">[Intoppa]</a>: and seeing how many people were involved in the level that they're at, at grade 10, grade 11, seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6960.618s">[Intoppa]</a>: So whether or not they pursue to do an art education, which I know some of the winners are, but I just want to say like, this is phenomenal work and thank you and congratulations to everyone who won an award and hopefully we'll see what you do next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6974.246s">[Intoppa]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=4709.946s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes, thank you miss Bowen for this report I just had a quick question just because it's my first time sitting on this committee or these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=4716.694s">[Intoppa]</a>: So the ones that are partially implemented in terms of trends in the past years, is this something that is abnormal normal that were partially implemented in these areas, or just curious to see if there's a trend going on of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=4731.334s">[Intoppa]</a>: missing the same things or are we or is this all new, so it's all new information that Jesse was looking at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=4766.639s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah I just want to make sure yeah because these things you know like I understand there's a lot but these are sort of things that we need to make sure that we are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=4773.202s">[Intoppa]</a>: fully implemented all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=4774.786s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I just wanted, I was just curious to see if this is something historically the district has lacked on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=1170.45s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=1193.842s">[Intoppa]</a>: So moved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5025.999s">[Intoppa]</a>: And thank you everyone for giving this valuable information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5028.82s">[Intoppa]</a>: I think, you know, from what it sounds like the city, your program is a phenomenal program to help, you know, professionally develop students, you know, at a time in their life after high school, uh, my initial concern was about the funding portion, but the a hundred thousand or the 200,000 and, you know, scraping from revolving funds or from the before and after school program, because I know we're still, we're, it's on the agenda tonight to talk about the budget and we're, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5053.885s">[Intoppa]</a>: It's not ideal what we're doing in the budget, and we're trying to fit in a $100,000, possibly $200,000 program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5060.612s">[Intoppa]</a>: that I don't know if spend budgeted for in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5063.733s">[Intoppa]</a>: And that part sort of just concerns me a little bit, I guess, to put it out there before we vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5070.815s">[Intoppa]</a>: And also, is this vote to start negotiations, to start talks, or is this vote to approve the actual program?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5079.877s">[Intoppa]</a>: Because while it seems like an amazing program, and from what I could tell, it really is, I just have concerns about bringing it in a time<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5086.619s">[Intoppa]</a>: where we're doing layoffs and scraping revolving funds to just get by for a level service, and we're trying to introduce more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5095.702s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I'm sorry to be so negative about that, but that's just sort of where my concerns are at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6446.996s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6449.298s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6451.259s">[Intoppa]</a>: Abstain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6638.137s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7542.342s">[Intoppa]</a>: I second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7576.812s">[Intoppa]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8105.436s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you vice chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8106.777s">[Intoppa]</a>: Graham Jerry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8108.138s">[Intoppa]</a>: I just want to take a moment and make a few thank yous 1 for creating this detailed report and giving a history lesson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8115.224s">[Intoppa]</a>: So that someone who missed everything and may have been like, wait, what happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8119.307s">[Intoppa]</a>: And, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8120.928s">[Intoppa]</a>: This tells the story of what happened and sort of what's been going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8126.412s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I really want to thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8127.913s">[Intoppa]</a>: I was actually talking to someone the other day about transparency and with budgeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8131.936s">[Intoppa]</a>: And they were like, well, is it going up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8133.237s">[Intoppa]</a>: Is transparency going down?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8134.158s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'm like, it seems like it's going up with the packet I just received.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8137.941s">[Intoppa]</a>: We're getting all this information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8139.422s">[Intoppa]</a>: And that's conversations on record, all these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8142.424s">[Intoppa]</a>: So just thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8143.705s">[Intoppa]</a>: And to also hear that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8145.947s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah, of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8146.888s">[Intoppa]</a>: I also want to say, as I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8149.963s">[Intoppa]</a>: I don't want to sound nonchalant when I talk about cuts, but I do want to acknowledge that these are people's lives and positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8154.926s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I don't want it to seem so casual when I, when we discuss this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8159.448s">[Intoppa]</a>: Um, so I want to acknowledge that and all the people who made their voices heard, but Jerry, just a quick question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8164.45s">[Intoppa]</a>: So in here with page 13, it talks about adding back positions that were cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8171.894s">[Intoppa]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8178.283s">[Intoppa]</a>: So the, and maybe I just misread.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8180.544s">[Intoppa]</a>: So this is why, this is why we asked the questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8183.325s">[Intoppa]</a>: Um, so the performing arts director, the assistant director of athletics, are those all positions now funded through the budget because they're not listed here anymore?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8225.737s">[Intoppa]</a>: So the director of performing arts is still is still out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8230.36s">[Intoppa]</a>: Understood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8230.921s">[Intoppa]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8233.183s">[Intoppa]</a>: Um, just wanted to double check because as much as I just talked about transparency, that just wasn't clear and wanted to double check with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8239.787s">[Intoppa]</a>: Um, I think at this moment, that's all I have, but if another question arise, I will let it be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9871.38s">[Intoppa]</a>: I was hoping to possibly make an amendment to also add into the language to find a way to increase the stipend pay for the band director with the idea that the pay that it is at may not be attractive to external candidates and that there will be a significant decline in the program's activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9893.956s">[Intoppa]</a>: Is it contractual?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9898.579s">[Intoppa]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9899.44s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9984.142s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9985.282s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you for the clarity, Vice Chair Grammich.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9986.963s">[Intoppa]</a>: I could actually<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9988.384s">[Intoppa]</a>: make an, I don't know if this is an amendment making an amendment, if Member Ruseau is making the amendment herself, if I could second the amendment to increase funds available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9999.892s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes, I would be willing to adapt that language, amend my amendment to amend to that language for the amendment of your motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10008.038s">[Intoppa]</a>: So be it there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11609.579s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11643.982s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11659.436s">[Intoppa]</a>: So moved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11684.147s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2959.409s">[Intoppa]</a>: Member Intapa?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2960.93s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2961.571s">[Intoppa]</a>: This probably isn't an important question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2963.953s">[Intoppa]</a>: This is just me being curious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2965.254s">[Intoppa]</a>: What CAD program are they teaching the kids?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2967.436s">[Intoppa]</a>: Are they teaching them SolidWorks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2969.178s">[Intoppa]</a>: I have no idea what the name of the program is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2970.759s">[Intoppa]</a>: Because it looks like the program that I was taught in college.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2973.862s">[Intoppa]</a>: So the fact that we're teaching these students such a, I mean, like it might not be, but it looks just like that program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2981.889s">[Intoppa]</a>: I use it at a college level and at an industry level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2984.471s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I just want to...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3004.395s">[Intoppa]</a>: I wish I had that when I was, like, that's crazy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3009.278s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3009.678s">[Intoppa]</a>: That's the only time you can get, but it's... I wanted to take that, I'm sorry, my mic is echoing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3015.703s">[Intoppa]</a>: everywhere um i'll speak softer um i just want to echo how great that is um because again like this is these are this is the time to learn these programs and you know it'll excel the future um through that so that i just wanted to send my regards is awesome thank you great thank you very much<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10442.964s">[Intoppa]</a>: Point of clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10444.264s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10444.664s">[Intoppa]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10445.085s">[Intoppa]</a>: Point of clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10446.165s">[Intoppa]</a>: My sincerest condolences to the family of Robin Irving, who was a McGlynn Middle School educator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10455.489s">[Intoppa]</a>: Just wanted to point that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10456.93s">[Intoppa]</a>: I also just wanted to say real quickly, because I know some of his family might be on the call and as a representative of the class of 2019, just really echo my sincere condolences to the family of Wade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10470.444s">[Intoppa]</a>: I've been trying to figure out how to really feel about this whole situation as we've all seen it play out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10478.857s">[Intoppa]</a>: But I wanted to just tell a quick story because I feel like it's an important message.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10482.563s">[Intoppa]</a>: I know it's late, but I'll make it quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10485.808s">[Intoppa]</a>: When the class lost a Pervative Coda in 2019, we were all extremely grief-stricken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10493.676s">[Intoppa]</a>: And about two years later, Wade actually reached out to me because he had known me working on scholarship.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10500.602s">[Intoppa]</a>: And he was like, hey, man, I'm sorry to bother you on your personal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10503.685s">[Intoppa]</a>: I was like, it's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10504.446s">[Intoppa]</a>: You can always reach out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10506.248s">[Intoppa]</a>: And he was like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10508.024s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'm really, you know, I was really close with him and I really wanted to do something for him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10512.932s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I don't know what to do, but I really want to do this thing that as a man of faith, he wanted to do a proxy baptism.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10521.537s">[Intoppa]</a>: And he had said, you know, but I really want to make sure I do this right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10525.22s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I really want to make sure that I go through the proper channels and I talk with the family because, you know, I could go to their door if I wanted to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10532.225s">[Intoppa]</a>: But, you know, I don't I don't want to do this right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10536.468s">[Intoppa]</a>: And so we talked with the family and we we got their approval and he went through with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10543.232s">[Intoppa]</a>: He was able to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10545.594s">[Intoppa]</a>: But, you know, something that Wade really stood for, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10549.474s">[Intoppa]</a>: making sure we care for and consider for and love one another even when no one is looking because he didn't have to do that but he did and he made sure that he was at peace and the family was at peace through no incidentals and i really just employ everyone listening that as we sort of navigate this grief to use the power of community and to check in on one another<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10575.925s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I implore you all to text or reach out to in any way that you can, however you feel like you can, to someone you haven't talked to in a while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10586.209s">[Intoppa]</a>: And to just really, really build that sense of community through what we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10591.45s">[Intoppa]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7177.78s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7231.067s">[Intoppa]</a>: Hello?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7236.371s">[Intoppa]</a>: Is this still feedbacking?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7237.652s">[Intoppa]</a>: No, we're good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10533.596s">[Intoppa]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11190.121s">[Intoppa]</a>: I sort of piggyback, thank you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11192.562s">[Intoppa]</a>: I also piggyback the comments of my peers surrounding the MCAS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11196.543s">[Intoppa]</a>: I used to be joked about that I was gonna run for school committee when I was at the Missatuck because I was so against the MCAS and it's actually my grandfather who was a long time educator in Wilmington retired early because of this becoming a requirement for graduation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11213.808s">[Intoppa]</a>: I've also heard horror stories of students who were capable and were great students, but you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11219.844s">[Intoppa]</a>: due to whatever, you know, it's an equity issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11221.886s">[Intoppa]</a>: It's a quality issue of accessibility and they could not, almost did not graduate because of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11229.391s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I am very much in support of that first question, 100% of, not to, I mean, I was able to afford higher education because of the MCAS because I was able to get a scholarship because of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11240.4s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I'm very fortunate and privileged that that was a thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11244.443s">[Intoppa]</a>: So yes, the unfortunate misconception that we're just getting rid of it and like, what happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11248.966s">[Intoppa]</a>: if we get rid of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11250.307s">[Intoppa]</a>: We're just getting rid of it as a requirement to move on to higher education or wherever you may want to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11257.43s">[Intoppa]</a>: So for question two, I'm a huge, huge supporter of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11260.651s">[Intoppa]</a>: So yeah, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2274.713s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2279.977s">[Intoppa]</a>: And thank you, Mayor, for also the clarification on the possible, the fact that we just still don't know what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2288.745s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I find that deeply unsettling, and we gotta figure that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2292.548s">[Intoppa]</a>: My questions with the data presented, do we know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2297.572s">[Intoppa]</a>: It's listed here, the Medford High Complex is listed as one item line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2301.296s">[Intoppa]</a>: Do we know the breakdown of faucets or fixtures, I guess is the better phrase, that are impacted in the high school versus the vocational buildings?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2313.19s">[Intoppa]</a>: Do we know the proportional difference between the two if one was more impacted than the other?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2325.252s">[Intoppa]</a>: Okay, no, that was just one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2336.525s">[Intoppa]</a>: OK, cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2337.326s">[Intoppa]</a>: No, I just wanted a clarification on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2338.866s">[Intoppa]</a>: And then also curious as to why, looking at the numbers again, why the two middle schools with the Andrews being impacted the most with above 15 parts per billion with 52 fixtures affected and the McGlynn Middle School with 33.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2358.411s">[Intoppa]</a>: I guess that has to go with the investigation when it comes to why it's happening and what it's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2363.913s">[Intoppa]</a>: But that is a stark number and difference compared to the rest of our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2371.937s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I'm not sure what that says for the data, but I just want to make a comment about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2375.998s">[Intoppa]</a>: And then in terms of turnaround with data, do we know what the appropriate time is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2380.28s">[Intoppa]</a>: Because the last number I saw was June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2383.117s">[Intoppa]</a>: Do we know when the turnaround is for when we should be getting this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2386.642s">[Intoppa]</a>: Like when we do testing, how long does it take to usually get results back?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2401.784s">[Intoppa]</a>: Sounds good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2403.706s">[Intoppa]</a>: I think that's all I have, but just wanted to thank MassDV for doing this great work and for helping us figure this all out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2412.072s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah, that's all I have to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2413.233s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=302.21s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=304.131s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=306.272s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=403.905s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=405.766s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5716.858s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6447.865s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6450.067s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7083.47s">[Intoppa]</a>: I mean, I also just wanted to share my love for Director Intoppa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7087.093s">[Intoppa]</a>: Francis is phenomenal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7089.694s">[Intoppa]</a>: But also, I guess it's a question for you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7093.357s">[Intoppa]</a>: So we heard concerns about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7097.895s">[Intoppa]</a>: This being a huge undertaking and using this to train our administration as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7101.636s">[Intoppa]</a>: Wouldn't we have to vote yes on this anyways to give her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7106.537s">[Intoppa]</a>: To be able to allow her to train school members or in any way, like, would we have to allow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7111.718s">[Intoppa]</a>: Um, consolidation language for support regardless to enact that or to, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7120.879s">[Intoppa]</a>: Give her some of those, those resources to train staff and to make that happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7186.457s">[Intoppa]</a>: I have no doubt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7188.559s">[Intoppa]</a>: That wasn't, I'm sorry, that wasn't the point of my question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7190.581s">[Intoppa]</a>: That was just a hypothetical, just like a question of if that route were to be explored, where it was just a support and like a training factor, if we needed to take that vote anyways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7202.092s">[Intoppa]</a>: That was just my question, but no, I completely understand and I can only imagine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7206.773s">[Intoppa]</a>: But it sounds like Superintendent Edward Vincent has some pointers or Member Olapade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7212.434s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'm not sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7212.854s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'm not sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7215.295s">[Intoppa]</a>: But I yield my time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7476.105s">[Intoppa]</a>: I was just going to make another amendment to, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7481.089s">[Intoppa]</a>: A lot of the temporary work until January 1 alongside sending its committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7487.193s">[Intoppa]</a>: But, um, that's dependent on if you want to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7490.956s">[Intoppa]</a>: Take the amendment or not, but just to revisit it, if it's as dire as you're saying, and I are the same, you know, if this is unauthorized work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7498.223s">[Intoppa]</a>: You know, I don't, I can't wrap my head around that right now, but if this is work that needs to be directly done and needs to make, ensure that our families are getting the needs that they need, then I would be comfortable authorizing temporarily to be revisited on January 1 after findings from the subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7516.034s">[Intoppa]</a>: And that's the, I motion to amend that original motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8111.328s">[Intoppa]</a>: I was just going to say that I accept the amendment to the amendment of including the language of July 1 through December 31.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8250.325s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8323.684s">[Intoppa]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8335.412s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8337.614s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8685.37s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah, I just wanted to say, you know, in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8687.481s">[Intoppa]</a>: in that same vein as we were talking about, about, you know, the arts department, how do we work with them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8692.682s">[Intoppa]</a>: My point was actually going to be about the graphic design department who I've had the fortunate ability to work with as a student in doing stuff with the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8704.425s">[Intoppa]</a>: But this may not be a, maybe not a topic for tonight, but the question of,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8711.132s">[Intoppa]</a>: we're seeing enrollment in the graphic design department and possibly helping alleviate that sort of wait list, you know, if we can get more people into the graphic design department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8722.056s">[Intoppa]</a>: As you know, we have two educators in there, making sure we're not overwhelming them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8725.338s">[Intoppa]</a>: But I know that in my time as a student at MassArt, I was a design major, but I was not in the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8736.055s">[Intoppa]</a>: Graphic design department, but they switched from graphic design to calm design communication design and doing so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8743.278s">[Intoppa]</a>: brought a bit more of opportunity for their students, mainly our.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8749.793s">[Intoppa]</a>: students who are from other countries, because that helps with visas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8755.379s">[Intoppa]</a>: By changing it to com design and by changing some of the GL class identifications, it actually makes it part of STEM in some way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8762.506s">[Intoppa]</a>: So that may open us up to some other grant opportunities, whether that be a future educator who's a visiting artist or maybe a part-time employee<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8771.269s">[Intoppa]</a>: but also to upgrade what we have as a shop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8774.893s">[Intoppa]</a>: So that discussion of possibly, and when you change the comm design is more, I guess, theory based and it is more, you know, a lot of the education is more surrounding the whys and strategy which when folks go if they choose to go to places like MassArt or other higher education institutions,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8793.151s">[Intoppa]</a>: It almost better serves them if they are getting that communication design, which is still very similar graphic design education, but it almost gears them up more for that thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8804.334s">[Intoppa]</a>: I know like, you know, it's one of the smallest here, but at SR it's the largest department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8809.675s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I don't think people fully realize the benefits to a graphic designer communication design education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8817.726s">[Intoppa]</a>: I don't think people view it too much as an art thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8820.387s">[Intoppa]</a>: But I know some institutions, it's almost looked down upon in their vocational schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8824.569s">[Intoppa]</a>: But I feel like the opportunities are very, I mean, you can't go anywhere without a graphic designer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8831.071s">[Intoppa]</a>: Everyone's hiring them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8841.856s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6005.619s">[Intoppa]</a>: If I could just say really quick before everyone leaves, I have a long history with Medford rowing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6011.36s">[Intoppa]</a>: I actually was on one of the inaugural middle school sculling teams.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6014.34s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I actually learned how to scull before sweeping and went through the team in my seventh grade year and eighth grade year at the Andrews and then all four years of high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6025.962s">[Intoppa]</a>: I don't remember a time we've meddled this grand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6029.266s">[Intoppa]</a>: First of all, during the fall season, kudos to you for being able to do that in a fall season, rolling those three miles up to the start and then the three miles all the way back and still being able to pull ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6038.796s">[Intoppa]</a>: That's absolutely insane.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6041.138s">[Intoppa]</a>: But I was super proud and super impressed just to see this from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6045.703s">[Intoppa]</a>: you know, my time as a rower, my time as a coxswain at this height, which was crazy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6050.024s">[Intoppa]</a>: Um, but then also my time as a coach during the pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6053.065s">[Intoppa]</a>: And then now like my favorite time of the year is getting to come and dock Marshall, the mayor's cup.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6057.907s">[Intoppa]</a>: Um, and I just, just absolutely so proud of you all just keep doing what you're doing and just see this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6064.209s">[Intoppa]</a>: I didn't even think about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6064.989s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I was sitting here, this grand of an achievement in the fall season,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6068.65s">[Intoppa]</a>: just keep doing what you're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6070.33s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'm so happy to see the team still going strong, even through the pandemic, now that we're, you know, where we are now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6075.712s">[Intoppa]</a>: So just congratulations and keep doing what you're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6079.153s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11411.193s">[Intoppa]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11411.673s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11414.485s">[Intoppa]</a>: I think it goes without saying why this is on the agenda and why this is being proposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11420.306s">[Intoppa]</a>: A lot of what this does is it affirms the actions we have taken to the ongoing incident with the lead being discovered in our school buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11430.968s">[Intoppa]</a>: And it takes the recommendations of the MWRA and the state of Massachusetts, as well as some federal guidelines and determinations of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11438.703s">[Intoppa]</a>: frequency of testing, what happens if we identify that there is presence of said metals in the buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11447.305s">[Intoppa]</a>: I will say just for point of clarification in the policy reading, the policy states for in the presence of lead results in the range of one to less than 15 ppb.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11459.007s">[Intoppa]</a>: And then there is there is a less than sign just to that just is mainly also for the copper level because there<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11466.198s">[Intoppa]</a>: wasn't an identifiable range.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11468.54s">[Intoppa]</a>: Obviously, the pipes are made of copper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11472.263s">[Intoppa]</a>: It's more of like one that starts to really, really leak into the water, usually due to age, if I'm not mistaken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11480.389s">[Intoppa]</a>: So it's just a matter of making sure that once it hits 1,300, that's when they need to be disabled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11484.413s">[Intoppa]</a>: And there wasn't really like a safe, like, oh, it's hand washing only.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11487.455s">[Intoppa]</a>: I couldn't find that anywhere, which is why it's a little less detailed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11491.538s">[Intoppa]</a>: But this is to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11494.349s">[Intoppa]</a>: reaffirm our commitment to making sure our community is informed, to making sure that it is clear the action to take when this is discovered, and how long we should be really kicking it into gear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11511.333s">[Intoppa]</a>: But I don't think I really have any further comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11513.314s">[Intoppa]</a>: I welcome as many questions as there are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11548.51s">[Intoppa]</a>: I don't, maybe, hold on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11554.894s">[Intoppa]</a>: It's just disabled as in like it cannot, that was following the guidance of what we followed through our testing and through what we've been doing, where if it was above 15 parts per billion, the fixture was disabled until we could figure out a cause.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11568.323s">[Intoppa]</a>: And so it's not, it's removed, not physically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11571.405s">[Intoppa]</a>: And that, if that, maybe I'm misunderstanding the phrasing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11576.708s">[Intoppa]</a>: But the idea was that that was way too high of a level of lead and that it could not be used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11582.353s">[Intoppa]</a>: And that furthers the philosophy that we've been using of we want to make sure that even if flushing is available, we cannot be certain that that is happening at an adequate time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11593.423s">[Intoppa]</a>: And we need to just take proper action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11597.166s">[Intoppa]</a>: So that is following the philosophy of what we are currently doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11603.399s">[Intoppa]</a>: And that is a concern of mine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11604.68s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I agree with that philosophy of, even if it's flushing, like, let's just get it down until we can figure out the best way to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11611.743s">[Intoppa]</a>: Because it's not even like a comment of, there's no good faith that people don't know how to time it or people know how to do it, but it's just not giving the opportunity for that to possibly happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11623.108s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I hope that clarifies the understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11634.865s">[Intoppa]</a>: The ranges were through the MWRA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11637.547s">[Intoppa]</a>: And then it was mainly to reaffirm the ranges with the MWRA as well as, so according to the 310CMR2, the Massachusetts drinking water regulations as well as what we have been doing with the recommendation from UMass Amherst and MassDEP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11971.275s">[Intoppa]</a>: And if I may, that is why I really appreciate the, and it was, it crossed my mind as writing the policy to put the frequency to a year just to see, I have a hope and a feeling that we will not have to go into that realm of testing everyone twice a calendar year if it's lead detected after we fix and solve the issue that is happening within our schools now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12000.631s">[Intoppa]</a>: because those are a lot of areas impacted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12004.813s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I'm hoping that once that is fixed, we won't have to go into the realm of doing it every year, once a year, as stated in the policy, which is why also they're separated between two and four of the priority of really making sure ones that we are consuming are being tested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12025.95s">[Intoppa]</a>: And that range comes from also, I believe was the MWR's range of three to five years for just testing in general.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12033.317s">[Intoppa]</a>: And so around the side of caution of doing two and four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12038.722s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I appreciate that, because again, if we find that we do not simply have the people power or the funds to do this at this frequency, we at least know that we've done our part to help fix the issue we have now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12052.392s">[Intoppa]</a>: And then we can revisit it and figure out what the problem is and how to amend that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12062.654s">[Intoppa]</a>: No, 100%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12072.416s">[Intoppa]</a>: To me, if I may, Mayor, the part of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12080.572s">[Intoppa]</a>: policy where it says what the plan is has already been started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12084.773s">[Intoppa]</a>: So to me, this is the start of that two-year cycle of we've already done all the testing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12094.835s">[Intoppa]</a>: So if the policy is enacted, we are already within that cycle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12098.396s">[Intoppa]</a>: So we now have two years to retest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12101.157s">[Intoppa]</a>: That's when that started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12102.937s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I think that that is a comfortable date to start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12106.167s">[Intoppa]</a>: because we did it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12107.287s">[Intoppa]</a>: We tested them all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12108.068s">[Intoppa]</a>: We're going to have to keep testing them to make sure that our solutions are permanent solutions, that we didn't just fix a small issue, that we actually got down to the root of the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12116.53s">[Intoppa]</a>: We figured it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12117.591s">[Intoppa]</a>: Good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12119.711s">[Intoppa]</a>: But in my eyes, that two-year calendar has started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12122.872s">[Intoppa]</a>: And if we have to push it to be in two more years when it gets like that's when it officially gets, whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12127.614s">[Intoppa]</a>: I don't understand the logistics of that quite yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12129.715s">[Intoppa]</a>: But to clarify that, that is my thought process with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12135.188s">[Intoppa]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=121.885s">[Intoppa]</a>: If I could just add, you know, I share very similar thoughts of minimal disruption, you know, in particular with students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=128.59s">[Intoppa]</a>: When I think of who I would want in the role of the interim, you know, I want someone who<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=138.683s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'm trying to figure out a way to really phrase this, but, you know, someone who during negotiations can work with our, with our, with our, you know, bargaining units, someone who can really work to striving some repairing some relationships and just working towards, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=156.758s">[Intoppa]</a>: just again, like while we're going through all of this, just minimal disruptions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=161.52s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I guess I just echo a lot of the same, but wanted to throw my two cents in there of, you know, observing behaviors, looking at who, you know, embodies that spirit of the Mustang Way and the spirit of who can lead, you know, the district in this interim period and possibly, you know, if they choose to apply and get appointed through the search.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=183.79s">[Intoppa]</a>: So those are my thoughts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=296.089s">[Intoppa]</a>: Could I just, you know, point of clarification ask how, because we mentioned us all giving nominations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=301.394s">[Intoppa]</a>: So, if our nominations differ, how do we go about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=304.517s">[Intoppa]</a>: Presenting that effectively and how do we do that as a motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=307.981s">[Intoppa]</a>: Do we just do we vote on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=311.184s">[Intoppa]</a>: Do we do 7 different motions is that 1 motion to a point if you could just clarify that would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=316.128s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I fully understand what is going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=371.656s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes, I would like to additionally nominate Mr. Paul Teixeira to be our interim superintendent of schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=381.643s">[Intoppa]</a>: I really liked Member Ruseau's language of, I believe, effective January 18th through June 30th, 2026, contingent on a successful contract negotiation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=483.974s">[Intoppa]</a>: Teixeira.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=562.096s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah, I don't think that's going to change, so it's fine leaving it as is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=570.699s">[Intoppa]</a>: Oh, okay, I understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=596.165s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>
