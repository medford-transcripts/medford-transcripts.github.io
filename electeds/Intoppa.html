    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2479.481s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2480.121s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah, it's no surprise to anyone that this is a huge, you know, aspect of my life as someone who suffered with an anaphylaxis, you know, tree nut allergy for all my life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2491.785s">[Intoppa]</a>: I think it was actually the first meeting with that whole chaos of me coming onto the committee where I promised I wasn't gonna say anything and lay back and then ended up going into a whole tirade about how I went through therapy as a child.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2505.51s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I did that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2506.391s">[Intoppa]</a>: I ended up going through therapy as a child because of an allergy incident within my elementary school where that was a safe haven for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2514.375s">[Intoppa]</a>: That was a place where I felt like I could be safe and eat food and not have to worry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2518.557s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I found something with nuts in it in the school and it was being served by the school and I spiraled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2524.92s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I was put into therapy for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2526.281s">[Intoppa]</a>: And that shouldn't happen to any child.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2528.462s">[Intoppa]</a>: And the school took abrupt action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2530.924s">[Intoppa]</a>: I actually remember the vice principal at the time, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2533.765s">[Intoppa]</a>: Brenner, sitting me down in her office and made me look through all of the food information sheets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2539.969s">[Intoppa]</a>: Didn't make me, but was like, this is everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2542.03s">[Intoppa]</a>: I would refuse to eat anything because I didn't trust it in the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2548.454s">[Intoppa]</a>: And so we've evolved and we've changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2550.616s">[Intoppa]</a>: And yeah, it's real.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2552.917s">[Intoppa]</a>: Gen Z is showing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2556.079s">[Intoppa]</a>: really alarming statistics of the increase of those with food allergies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2560.481s">[Intoppa]</a>: And the awareness level does not match the increase that people are suffering from it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2565.204s">[Intoppa]</a>: You know, some people still think hand sanitizer kills those germs, or I can eat it two seats away, or if I just wipe it with hot water, I'll be fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2572.708s">[Intoppa]</a>: And it's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2574.969s">[Intoppa]</a>: It's not okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2577.672s">[Intoppa]</a>: And you know, how do people use epinephrine, you know, auto injectors, my entire senior thesis was in epinephrine auto injectors and the lack of people knowing how to use them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2585.519s">[Intoppa]</a>: And it's no fault of their own, they just weren't taught.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2589.443s">[Intoppa]</a>: So looking at ways that we can better make this aware, you start with a proclamation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2592.926s">[Intoppa]</a>: I want to thank the Pellican family for sending this our way and making us aware of this and telling their story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2600.168s">[Intoppa]</a>: But yeah, I just wanted to put this proclamation forward so we can get the ball rolling on, you know, better ways to make sure that the community is aware of how to deal with this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2610.154s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2912.497s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah, so thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2913.878s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I actually meant to mention that in my whole, you know, speech on top of the speech of, so like many of us, I got to go serve lunch for, you know, I'm going to lunch service hero day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2928.646s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I got to visit my old school, the Mistletoe, and they sort of gave me a tour of the building and I got to feel like, you know, principal for the day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2935.27s">[Intoppa]</a>: And it felt really wrong to be back there because that was a no go zone as a student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2939.612s">[Intoppa]</a>: And one of the things that I was really happy to learn about was that the nut, the, you know, the peanut tree nut free table is now the peanut tree nut table and where, you know, I used to have to sit there away from all my friends and I used to sit there and eat, you know, lunch every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2955.245s">[Intoppa]</a>: And now that's not the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2956.246s">[Intoppa]</a>: And that those students don't feel ostracized from the group and separated from the group because of something they can't control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2961.789s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I was really happy to see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2963.851s">[Intoppa]</a>: And they showed me the bathroom that they lead the students to so they can properly wash their hands.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2967.413s">[Intoppa]</a>: So they're not bringing it back to the classroom where they may sit next to that student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2972.036s">[Intoppa]</a>: So thank you Nurse Silva for bringing that, Director Silva for bringing that to all of our attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2976.899s">[Intoppa]</a>: It was really nice to see that on Friday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/V2-HjCd92gQ&t=2980.001s">[Intoppa]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=5421.338s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6967.617s">[Intoppa]</a>: Sure, I just have a motion to sever the motion and the two separate motions, one for the approval to send it to discussion and then the other one to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6976.684s">[Intoppa]</a>: They are two already?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6977.885s">[Intoppa]</a>: Okay, cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6978.426s">[Intoppa]</a>: I couldn't hear that well, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=6980.207s">[Intoppa]</a>: I rescind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7653.794s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7654.334s">[Intoppa]</a>: On the same aspect of Missitook, for that second five day, according to this, the price goes down by $2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7661.82s">[Intoppa]</a>: Is that the correct rate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7664.061s">[Intoppa]</a>: Because it goes from $5.52 to $5.50?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7665.522s">[Intoppa]</a>: Or am I just reading this wrong?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7672.793s">[Intoppa]</a>: For MEEP for the second five day, MISTITUC for monthly is 552, yearly 5525.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7677.294s">[Intoppa]</a>: And then on MEEP 2025 to 2026, that second five day is 550 and then 550.04, so it's less.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7680.896s">[Intoppa]</a>: Is that the actual rate or?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7702.514s">[Intoppa]</a>: Because the monthly and yearly are both, both options are less than what is the 2024 and 2025 number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7710.478s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I'm not sure what the actual 25 and 26 number is, if that is the actual number, but all of them go up except for that one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7732.646s">[Intoppa]</a>: It's more of a point of clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7735.208s">[Intoppa]</a>: What is that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7735.828s">[Intoppa]</a>: Is the 2526 number correct, or is the 2425 number correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7749.699s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7750.279s">[Intoppa]</a>: I think that's the only one I've noticed so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=7769.083s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=8070.544s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=8071.124s">[Intoppa]</a>: Similar point of clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=8073.806s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'm assuming it's just another clerical issue of if you're looking at the before care program, the 3% increase is less than the 2% increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=8083.413s">[Intoppa]</a>: It's more of an ask that I'm assuming it's my math is not awful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=8088.696s">[Intoppa]</a>: It's probably 122.57 instead of 112.57.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=8094.58s">[Intoppa]</a>: So if that could just be corrected for our families at home, if they're using this as a point of reference, that would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=8102.382s">[Intoppa]</a>: On the back page, before care programs, school year 2025 to 2026, the number for 3% is less than the number for 2%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w_5sqSHqlKY&t=8114.866s">[Intoppa]</a>: On monthly, for day three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=278.32s">[Intoppa]</a>: In before care program school year 2025 2026 the 3% increase for monthly three days should read 122.57 not 112.57.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=286.968s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'm just noting that I understand that but I'm just noting that so if this infograph is sent out,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=295.572s">[Intoppa]</a>: that we correct that similar to the one that was mentioned for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=298.574s">[Intoppa]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Q8tZvOlAobY&t=767.482s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=4214.225s">[Intoppa]</a>: Oh, I was just going to say that if there are no other questions from the committee that I can second the motion as written.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=4225.173s">[Intoppa]</a>: I think that, you know, the addition of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=4227.947s">[Intoppa]</a>: know, clarification on who will walk at graduation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=4230.248s">[Intoppa]</a>: I know that that is a huge, I'm sure, stressful point for, you know, members of the community who, you know, that may be an issue for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=4238.332s">[Intoppa]</a>: So, I'm just, I'm happy to see that that's inclusive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=4241.833s">[Intoppa]</a>: Passing of geometry, it's all pretty written out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=4244.174s">[Intoppa]</a>: So, I, if there are no other questions from the committee, then I, it seems like we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=4249.497s">[Intoppa]</a>: Then afterwards, I'll second the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=4251.698s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=4374.278s">[Intoppa]</a>: Just a quick point of clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=4375.539s">[Intoppa]</a>: So on page three, this was something I was actually gonna ask and I completely forgot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=4381.441s">[Intoppa]</a>: So last bullet point, former MHS students without CD, is this,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=4387.753s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'm assuming this is what this is, but I just want to clarify.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=4390.034s">[Intoppa]</a>: So this is basically saying, if you did not graduate, you can retroactively apply for either a certificate of completion or a diploma, or is it just certificate of completion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=4443.882s">[Intoppa]</a>: Awesome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=4444.323s">[Intoppa]</a>: No, I love to see that because I saw, I believe I'm going to, I'm sorry, I'll talk less loud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=4449.267s">[Intoppa]</a>: So it doesn't echo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=4450.688s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I think I saw another district within the state or maybe even, yeah, head of the state because we passed the MCATs ruling, like really publicly mentioning this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=4458.995s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I think we have a lot of work to do to work with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=4461.652s">[Intoppa]</a>: our MarCom team, as well as our alumni association to really push this and be very clear about, yes, it's an immutable basis, but we'll help you get there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=4470.137s">[Intoppa]</a>: So that way, you know, this is an unfair thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=4473.459s">[Intoppa]</a>: We're fixing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=4474.699s">[Intoppa]</a>: The state has entrusted us to fix this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=4477.941s">[Intoppa]</a>: Like, let's not, like, let's go back and do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=4481.123s">[Intoppa]</a>: And just to make that very clear in any way we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=4483.664s">[Intoppa]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=4484.965s">[Intoppa]</a>: That's really nice to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=4486.186s">[Intoppa]</a>: And obviously I still second the motion on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=5759.489s">[Intoppa]</a>: I also just yeah I really want to echo that point of like while these things<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=5763.913s">[Intoppa]</a>: I guess what I want to say is when this list is sent to us, I really do welcome any community input about a lot of these issues because like, again, while they may be small to some people who may be a little more able-bodied or may not run into these issues, it's good to know like if someone has like, oh, I'm not crazy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=5783.301s">[Intoppa]</a>: Like this is actually something that significantly impacts my mobility, or this is something that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=5789.528s">[Intoppa]</a>: just the day to day like this is a small frustration like yeah my knees get colder like they get burned from that like this is, these are all really good things that I would hope that the community would also be able to take a look at and say I used to I frequent this building this is something that affects me on a daily basis I thought it was small but I'm not crazy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=5804.815s">[Intoppa]</a>: Just that little affirmation of like no this needs to be changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=5808.636s">[Intoppa]</a>: And we acknowledge that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=5810.445s">[Intoppa]</a>: Um but II do want to get a little bit away from the like, well, it's a little small like it does seem small to some people but like it really is a huge thing for a lot of people's day to day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=5819.75s">[Intoppa]</a>: So, just welcome that community input whenever that list is made available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gpoenA2JwNk&t=5824.173s">[Intoppa]</a>: So, thank you to my colleagues for for raising that that concern and ask and thank you for doing the work and thank you for acknowledging it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=4103.049s">[Intoppa]</a>: Oh, my God.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=4144.313s">[Intoppa]</a>: Oh, was I unmuted for that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=4146.073s">[Intoppa]</a>: Sorry, I'm yelling at my dad because he said something about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=4149.974s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=4150.795s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=4151.715s">[Intoppa]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=4153.935s">[Intoppa]</a>: And it's not, I'm not there because I'm gonna smile about my birthday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=4156.956s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'm not there because I just got back from New Orleans from a conference, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Aod_AldxCno&t=4161.912s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you everyone for doing the work and for meeting today and talking about the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=414.811s">[Intoppa]</a>: Assuming this is a motion to go into executive session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=416.851s">[Intoppa]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=2725.571s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah, just one quick question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=2727.352s">[Intoppa]</a>: Just looking at the climate and especially with traveling and, you know, everything that's going on, do we expect that any possible executive orders or any of the already written executive orders may have an impact on the implementation of this program, just so that we're aware and we understand any risks that may come with it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=2770.259s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=2770.76s">[Intoppa]</a>: Just wanted to just double check on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=2772.641s">[Intoppa]</a>: Obviously it's ever changing, but for the time being, before we vote, I just want to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=2777.725s">[Intoppa]</a>: So appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=3974.601s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=3975.001s">[Intoppa]</a>: I don't really see any, uh, distinctions at the moment that I would change, although I would.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=3981.246s">[Intoppa]</a>: Um, with respect to vice chair Graham push a little bit back on the on call manner, because as someone who has served in on call capacities before, I feel like being pretty blunt about the demand is almost better to, like, have it outright.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=3994.716s">[Intoppa]</a>: Like, I understand the appeal and trying to make sure that it's phrased in a way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=3999.42s">[Intoppa]</a>: But, um, I think something about, you know, just general on call support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4003.943s">[Intoppa]</a>: Maybe, maybe, maybe don't say 24 hours a day, because that I mean, it's kind of just implied with the phrase on call support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4009.488s">[Intoppa]</a>: But<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4010.83s">[Intoppa]</a>: I think being very, very blunt with that maybe, in my opinion, I think is a better course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4028.743s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah, if we could sever that amendment, that'd be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4031.685s">[Intoppa]</a>: I mean, I mean, I'm also I'm also open to amending the amendment and just saying, to just be available in an on call support manner throughout the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4040.708s">[Intoppa]</a>: as opposed to in an on-call manner, 24 hours a day throughout the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4100.783s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah, no, that works for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4101.744s">[Intoppa]</a>: I think that's what I'm trying to imply.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4103.485s">[Intoppa]</a>: I think I was just held up on using the on-call support language and keeping that consistent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4110.19s">[Intoppa]</a>: But yeah, no, that works for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4113.012s">[Intoppa]</a>: It works for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=4513.912s">[Intoppa]</a>: I did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5518.808s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5680.117s">[Intoppa]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5686.076s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5686.536s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah, I believe that was the talk that we had back in December when this is originally put that it would be bringing down from 10 to 15.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5694.498s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I also know Member Reinfeld had a comment, and this may be her comment about that number being changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5700.339s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'm open to amending and would encourage an amendment, actually motion to amend, to go from where it states lead results to go from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5711.61s">[Intoppa]</a>: Anytime 15 is mentioned to go to 10 parts per billion, because it looks like looking at Google and you know, whatever comes up, like according to mass.gov, it's still 15 parts per billion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5722.653s">[Intoppa]</a>: But if that's in progress, and we can be progressive about it and get ahead of the game, so we don't have to revisit this and then say it's actually 10.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5728.914s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'm more than happy to amend the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=5730.354s">[Intoppa]</a>: So that way it actually reads as 10 instead of 15.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6422.969s">[Intoppa]</a>: Motion for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8Kto7egzLDI&t=6784.055s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah, today replaced March 10th as far as I'm concerned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=828.115s">[Intoppa]</a>: This may just be a small, so in the phrasing, is it, and you said roughly, but I just want confirmation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=833.56s">[Intoppa]</a>: It's not, it's 60 cumulative, so there could be like 20, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=837.243s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=837.443s">[Intoppa]</a>: Just wanted to make sure, because some people may have questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=839.745s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3394.833s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'll also add that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3806.197s">[Intoppa]</a>: Try.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/z9B9_JzAXRA&t=0.251s">[Intoppa]</a>: and broadcasting to YouTube.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/z9B9_JzAXRA&t=253.914s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you, Member Ruseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/z9B9_JzAXRA&t=254.935s">[Intoppa]</a>: So my question, so I know I had to do the disclosure because of my own cousin-in-law, long lost union.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/z9B9_JzAXRA&t=265.123s">[Intoppa]</a>: But to me, this seems like direct<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/z9B9_JzAXRA&t=272.481s">[Intoppa]</a>: conflict of interest law, like the disclosure is only if you're not affected by conflict of interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/z9B9_JzAXRA&t=278.183s">[Intoppa]</a>: And someone may think that you, like, that's just my interpretation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/z9B9_JzAXRA&t=283.825s">[Intoppa]</a>: So while I do think it would be, you know, beneficial, I don't understand how us voting goes around the law and what it's set forth by.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/z9B9_JzAXRA&t=292.548s">[Intoppa]</a>: I mean, I'm sure, I'm sure, Dr. Galusi, you've seeked, you know, legal counsel on this, but I just don't understand how<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/z9B9_JzAXRA&t=300.743s">[Intoppa]</a>: Because if the mayor has to recuse herself, member Branley might have to both because they have siblings like that doesn't bring financial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/z9B9_JzAXRA&t=306.937s">[Intoppa]</a>: It doesn't affect the finances of the household.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/z9B9_JzAXRA&t=309.563s">[Intoppa]</a>: And this does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/z9B9_JzAXRA&t=312.906s">[Intoppa]</a>: Right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/z9B9_JzAXRA&t=428.323s">[Intoppa]</a>: this training for like four years now and I just never knew of the safety net because it's been something that's been a concern of mine as a city and state employee but I'm glad to hear that because that makes sense there had to be there'd have to be some form of safety net built in because again like if everyone had conflict on the committee we didn't have quorum what we do um so yeah I just had a question that that was that was a question is how what is the the statute and precedent set forth by this so that makes sense though so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/z9B9_JzAXRA&t=629.512s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/z9B9_JzAXRA&t=630.092s">[Intoppa]</a>: I just wanted to also, so thank you to my colleagues for explaining the voting piece, because that wasn't explained when I spoke with the attorney the other day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/z9B9_JzAXRA&t=638.294s">[Intoppa]</a>: So this makes complete sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/z9B9_JzAXRA&t=640.855s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I just<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/z9B9_JzAXRA&t=642.613s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah, I factored into every other conflict of interest saying we have to recuse ourselves, but that makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/z9B9_JzAXRA&t=648.835s">[Intoppa]</a>: So with that being said, I can second the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=5871.068s">[Intoppa]</a>: No, I think these two had it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6147.394s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you, mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6148.075s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6148.575s">[Intoppa]</a>: Um, yeah, I guess I just want to really support, um, voice my support of the thought of the sliding scale, the sliding scale option, as well as, um, director Petrelas mentioned the aspect of even bringing it from 275 to 250.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6166.352s">[Intoppa]</a>: Um, because I would, you know, I'm echoing really with the mayor's comments earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6171.336s">[Intoppa]</a>: about affordability and making sure that we could sort of serve our community the best we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6176.741s">[Intoppa]</a>: And also the words of Member Reinfeld in terms of seeing more of a differential between the residential and method employee rate as well as the non-resident rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6189.892s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I believe you said that we can't make an amendment on the floor in regards to this to vote on it, to make it down or to even talk about bringing it down to 250, but I would like to see<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6199.808s">[Intoppa]</a>: I would urge that decision to be made to at least bring it down to 250.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6204.231s">[Intoppa]</a>: Excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6204.912s">[Intoppa]</a>: I don't know what that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6206.773s">[Intoppa]</a>: Um as opposed to the proposed 275 because if that, you know, we need to look at cost of living for our treasured employees as well as, you know, the director of Petralas as a educator within our system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6217.822s">[Intoppa]</a>: Um you know, making sure that we're able to continue to have staffing, comfortable staffing, as well as, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6230.038s">[Intoppa]</a>: I would hate to see it go up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6230.999s">[Intoppa]</a>: I think I would prefer to see it go up to, you know, 225 or 250 in that area as opposed to the proposed 275.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6237.503s">[Intoppa]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6372.496s">[Intoppa]</a>: If I can clarify, and sorry if I'm mumbling, I'm trying not to talk too loud so we don't get feedback issues like I normally do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6379.3s">[Intoppa]</a>: Like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6380.28s">[Intoppa]</a>: No, the amendment is more to look at, if we cannot implement a sliding scale, it was more to look at trying to keep the rate as affordable as possible for the residents and employees of the Medford public schools and to widen the margin between the non-resident<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6399.097s">[Intoppa]</a>: option that is implemented from trying to differentiate the two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6402.798s">[Intoppa]</a>: What's the specific phrasing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6405.138s">[Intoppa]</a>: Not resident, non-resident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6407.939s">[Intoppa]</a>: So it's to entertain both the option of a sliding scale to see if that will work or if the 225, 250 rate is more feasible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6421.421s">[Intoppa]</a>: It's to compare the two and to see what that'll do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6667.615s">[Intoppa]</a>: That was the point I made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=6670.957s">[Intoppa]</a>: It's not just me voting together, but to see which option is more feasible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=7453.377s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=7453.938s">[Intoppa]</a>: I think my only amendment is also just to make, under discrimination, harassment, and bullying, bullet points one and bullet point five<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=7465.858s">[Intoppa]</a>: match up correctly because their bullet point one has some of the race, ethnicity, color, national origin, immigration status, but it doesn't include gender identity, religion, sexual orientation, disability status, just just to make the amendment is to make bullet point one and bullet point five more reflective of each other, and just to make sure that they<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=7485.913s">[Intoppa]</a>: And then my other amendment was with number four, but since that is gone, there's no need for that amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=7493.962s">[Intoppa]</a>: But other than that, at this moment in time, I don't see any other amendments on my plate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/j8OA0M_9NI0&t=7501.43s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=66.704s">[Intoppa]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=175.752s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=176.693s">[Intoppa]</a>: Um, so it came up the other day about possible conflict of interest due to some familial ties within the schools, especially since we are going into union MTA contract negotiations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=190.061s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'm here to say that after talking with the lawyer of the day with the state, they have advised me that due to the severance of how far<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=198.342s">[Intoppa]</a>: We are in terms of, you know, being family that and because there's no financial gain on my end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=204.89s">[Intoppa]</a>: The only thing I have to do is file disclosure of appearance of conflict of interest as required by general law 26 a section 23 b3.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=212.608s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I basically just have to file that that's been filed with the city clerk and I just have to read this on the floor and then we're fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=218.37s">[Intoppa]</a>: But I do not have to abstain from union negotiations with the MTA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=222.231s">[Intoppa]</a>: This is just the thing I have to do in order to actually be a voting member when it comes to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=227.993s">[Intoppa]</a>: So it's basically, this is on file with the city clerk, but I basically am just an in-law relative to Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=234.015s">[Intoppa]</a>: Jacqueline Gatto, the teacher at the Brooks Elementary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=236.96s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'm a second cousin or first cousin removed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=239.141s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'm not really sure to miss Nicole Sulo, teacher at the books elementary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=243.142s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'm also technically a member of the math teachers association, but I'm in the association of professional administrators, which at the state level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=250.184s">[Intoppa]</a>: So there's a completely different subgroup than the MTA Medford teachers association.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=254.346s">[Intoppa]</a>: My union gets no financial gain from any, you know, negotiations that happen between the city and the teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=260.368s">[Intoppa]</a>: So we've read this on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=261.828s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'm fine to continue, but just wanted it in record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=264.717s">[Intoppa]</a>: Um, and if people want to see the full thing, they can contact the city clerk, but thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8005.347s">[Intoppa]</a>: And because of that, I have talked with a lot of parents, especially about the need for bringing a lot of our services in-house and how we need to have programs for students that can equal the playing field, have an equitable experience in our schools, because it's just not there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8020.319s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I want to thank you personally for a lot of the advocacy work that you're doing and for coming here and giving your point of view and thought process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8030.867s">[Intoppa]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8067.54s">[Intoppa]</a>: over the years that I've been involved in the conversation that I'm just really happy to see where it's at right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8073.906s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I'm excited to see where he's going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8076.989s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8202.805s">[Intoppa]</a>: I know that some of our staff representatives from our nursing union were here earlier and they had sent an email asking for support because, you know, looking at how the budget's been and the positions that have been reestablished just really isn't doing it for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8218.877s">[Intoppa]</a>: And, you know, personally, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8221.107s">[Intoppa]</a>: I have my full support for reestablishing the positions that we lost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8226.532s">[Intoppa]</a>: That was one of the big talking points that we had talked about, or that had been happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8232.198s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I would actually motion<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8235.157s">[Intoppa]</a>: to pull from the undistributed to either restore at least one floater position, motion to amend the supplemental appropriation of the 2024 just to give them at least, I know that probably having all four positions back isn't something we could swing, but I feel like having at least one other additional floater within the unit might be, especially because as it relates to question eight, with extending the day, we may need some additional staffing needs when it comes to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8293.83s">[Intoppa]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8294.11s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8294.991s">[Intoppa]</a>: I didn't mean to interrupt you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8296.912s">[Intoppa]</a>: So then it would go from, so we lost four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8299.053s">[Intoppa]</a>: We brought in one more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8300.173s">[Intoppa]</a>: So then three were missing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8302.314s">[Intoppa]</a>: We lost three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8302.975s">[Intoppa]</a>: So then now we're missing two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pVNz2f7XJUQ&t=8312.028s">[Intoppa]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=121.885s">[Intoppa]</a>: If I could just add, you know, I share very similar thoughts of minimal disruption, you know, in particular with students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=128.59s">[Intoppa]</a>: When I think of who I would want in the role of the interim, you know, I want someone who<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=138.683s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'm trying to figure out a way to really phrase this, but, you know, someone who during negotiations can work with our, with our, with our, you know, bargaining units, someone who can really work to striving some repairing some relationships and just working towards, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=156.758s">[Intoppa]</a>: just again, like while we're going through all of this, just minimal disruptions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=161.52s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I guess I just echo a lot of the same, but wanted to throw my two cents in there of, you know, observing behaviors, looking at who, you know, embodies that spirit of the Mustang Way and the spirit of who can lead, you know, the district in this interim period and possibly, you know, if they choose to apply and get appointed through the search.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=183.79s">[Intoppa]</a>: So those are my thoughts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=296.089s">[Intoppa]</a>: Could I just, you know, point of clarification ask how, because we mentioned us all giving nominations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=301.394s">[Intoppa]</a>: So, if our nominations differ, how do we go about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=304.517s">[Intoppa]</a>: Presenting that effectively and how do we do that as a motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=307.981s">[Intoppa]</a>: Do we just do we vote on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=311.184s">[Intoppa]</a>: Do we do 7 different motions is that 1 motion to a point if you could just clarify that would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=316.128s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I fully understand what is going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=371.656s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes, I would like to additionally nominate Mr. Paul Teixeira to be our interim superintendent of schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=381.643s">[Intoppa]</a>: I really liked Member Ruseau's language of, I believe, effective January 18th through June 30th, 2026, contingent on a successful contract negotiation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=483.974s">[Intoppa]</a>: Teixeira.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=562.096s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah, I don't think that's going to change, so it's fine leaving it as is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=570.699s">[Intoppa]</a>: Oh, okay, I understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Yhv5Nitagw&t=596.165s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6005.619s">[Intoppa]</a>: If I could just say really quick before everyone leaves, I have a long history with Medford rowing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6011.36s">[Intoppa]</a>: I actually was on one of the inaugural middle school sculling teams.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6014.34s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I actually learned how to scull before sweeping and went through the team in my seventh grade year and eighth grade year at the Andrews and then all four years of high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6025.962s">[Intoppa]</a>: I don't remember a time we've meddled this grand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6029.266s">[Intoppa]</a>: First of all, during the fall season, kudos to you for being able to do that in a fall season, rolling those three miles up to the start and then the three miles all the way back and still being able to pull ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6038.796s">[Intoppa]</a>: That's absolutely insane.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6041.138s">[Intoppa]</a>: But I was super proud and super impressed just to see this from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6045.703s">[Intoppa]</a>: you know, my time as a rower, my time as a coxswain at this height, which was crazy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6050.024s">[Intoppa]</a>: Um, but then also my time as a coach during the pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6053.065s">[Intoppa]</a>: And then now like my favorite time of the year is getting to come and dock Marshall, the mayor's cup.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6057.907s">[Intoppa]</a>: Um, and I just, just absolutely so proud of you all just keep doing what you're doing and just see this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6064.209s">[Intoppa]</a>: I didn't even think about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6064.989s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I was sitting here, this grand of an achievement in the fall season,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6068.65s">[Intoppa]</a>: just keep doing what you're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6070.33s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'm so happy to see the team still going strong, even through the pandemic, now that we're, you know, where we are now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6075.712s">[Intoppa]</a>: So just congratulations and keep doing what you're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=6079.153s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11411.193s">[Intoppa]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11411.673s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11414.485s">[Intoppa]</a>: I think it goes without saying why this is on the agenda and why this is being proposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11420.306s">[Intoppa]</a>: A lot of what this does is it affirms the actions we have taken to the ongoing incident with the lead being discovered in our school buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11430.968s">[Intoppa]</a>: And it takes the recommendations of the MWRA and the state of Massachusetts, as well as some federal guidelines and determinations of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11438.703s">[Intoppa]</a>: frequency of testing, what happens if we identify that there is presence of said metals in the buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11447.305s">[Intoppa]</a>: I will say just for point of clarification in the policy reading, the policy states for in the presence of lead results in the range of one to less than 15 ppb.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11459.007s">[Intoppa]</a>: And then there is there is a less than sign just to that just is mainly also for the copper level because there<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11466.198s">[Intoppa]</a>: wasn't an identifiable range.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11468.54s">[Intoppa]</a>: Obviously, the pipes are made of copper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11472.263s">[Intoppa]</a>: It's more of like one that starts to really, really leak into the water, usually due to age, if I'm not mistaken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11480.389s">[Intoppa]</a>: So it's just a matter of making sure that once it hits 1,300, that's when they need to be disabled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11484.413s">[Intoppa]</a>: And there wasn't really like a safe, like, oh, it's hand washing only.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11487.455s">[Intoppa]</a>: I couldn't find that anywhere, which is why it's a little less detailed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11491.538s">[Intoppa]</a>: But this is to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11494.349s">[Intoppa]</a>: reaffirm our commitment to making sure our community is informed, to making sure that it is clear the action to take when this is discovered, and how long we should be really kicking it into gear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11511.333s">[Intoppa]</a>: But I don't think I really have any further comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11513.314s">[Intoppa]</a>: I welcome as many questions as there are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11548.51s">[Intoppa]</a>: I don't, maybe, hold on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11554.894s">[Intoppa]</a>: It's just disabled as in like it cannot, that was following the guidance of what we followed through our testing and through what we've been doing, where if it was above 15 parts per billion, the fixture was disabled until we could figure out a cause.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11568.323s">[Intoppa]</a>: And so it's not, it's removed, not physically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11571.405s">[Intoppa]</a>: And that, if that, maybe I'm misunderstanding the phrasing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11576.708s">[Intoppa]</a>: But the idea was that that was way too high of a level of lead and that it could not be used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11582.353s">[Intoppa]</a>: And that furthers the philosophy that we've been using of we want to make sure that even if flushing is available, we cannot be certain that that is happening at an adequate time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11593.423s">[Intoppa]</a>: And we need to just take proper action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11597.166s">[Intoppa]</a>: So that is following the philosophy of what we are currently doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11603.399s">[Intoppa]</a>: And that is a concern of mine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11604.68s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I agree with that philosophy of, even if it's flushing, like, let's just get it down until we can figure out the best way to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11611.743s">[Intoppa]</a>: Because it's not even like a comment of, there's no good faith that people don't know how to time it or people know how to do it, but it's just not giving the opportunity for that to possibly happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11623.108s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I hope that clarifies the understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11634.865s">[Intoppa]</a>: The ranges were through the MWRA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11637.547s">[Intoppa]</a>: And then it was mainly to reaffirm the ranges with the MWRA as well as, so according to the 310CMR2, the Massachusetts drinking water regulations as well as what we have been doing with the recommendation from UMass Amherst and MassDEP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=11971.275s">[Intoppa]</a>: And if I may, that is why I really appreciate the, and it was, it crossed my mind as writing the policy to put the frequency to a year just to see, I have a hope and a feeling that we will not have to go into that realm of testing everyone twice a calendar year if it's lead detected after we fix and solve the issue that is happening within our schools now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12000.631s">[Intoppa]</a>: because those are a lot of areas impacted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12004.813s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I'm hoping that once that is fixed, we won't have to go into the realm of doing it every year, once a year, as stated in the policy, which is why also they're separated between two and four of the priority of really making sure ones that we are consuming are being tested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12025.95s">[Intoppa]</a>: And that range comes from also, I believe was the MWR's range of three to five years for just testing in general.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12033.317s">[Intoppa]</a>: And so around the side of caution of doing two and four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12038.722s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I appreciate that, because again, if we find that we do not simply have the people power or the funds to do this at this frequency, we at least know that we've done our part to help fix the issue we have now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12052.392s">[Intoppa]</a>: And then we can revisit it and figure out what the problem is and how to amend that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12062.654s">[Intoppa]</a>: No, 100%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12072.416s">[Intoppa]</a>: To me, if I may, Mayor, the part of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12080.572s">[Intoppa]</a>: policy where it says what the plan is has already been started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12084.773s">[Intoppa]</a>: So to me, this is the start of that two-year cycle of we've already done all the testing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12094.835s">[Intoppa]</a>: So if the policy is enacted, we are already within that cycle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12098.396s">[Intoppa]</a>: So we now have two years to retest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12101.157s">[Intoppa]</a>: That's when that started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12102.937s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I think that that is a comfortable date to start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12106.167s">[Intoppa]</a>: because we did it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12107.287s">[Intoppa]</a>: We tested them all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12108.068s">[Intoppa]</a>: We're going to have to keep testing them to make sure that our solutions are permanent solutions, that we didn't just fix a small issue, that we actually got down to the root of the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12116.53s">[Intoppa]</a>: We figured it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12117.591s">[Intoppa]</a>: Good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12119.711s">[Intoppa]</a>: But in my eyes, that two-year calendar has started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12122.872s">[Intoppa]</a>: And if we have to push it to be in two more years when it gets like that's when it officially gets, whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12127.614s">[Intoppa]</a>: I don't understand the logistics of that quite yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12129.715s">[Intoppa]</a>: But to clarify that, that is my thought process with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/53d9Rk8X1OU&t=12135.188s">[Intoppa]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8685.37s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah, I just wanted to say, you know, in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8687.481s">[Intoppa]</a>: in that same vein as we were talking about, about, you know, the arts department, how do we work with them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8692.682s">[Intoppa]</a>: My point was actually going to be about the graphic design department who I've had the fortunate ability to work with as a student in doing stuff with the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8704.425s">[Intoppa]</a>: But this may not be a, maybe not a topic for tonight, but the question of,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8711.132s">[Intoppa]</a>: we're seeing enrollment in the graphic design department and possibly helping alleviate that sort of wait list, you know, if we can get more people into the graphic design department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8722.056s">[Intoppa]</a>: As you know, we have two educators in there, making sure we're not overwhelming them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8725.338s">[Intoppa]</a>: But I know that in my time as a student at MassArt, I was a design major, but I was not in the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8736.055s">[Intoppa]</a>: Graphic design department, but they switched from graphic design to calm design communication design and doing so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8743.278s">[Intoppa]</a>: brought a bit more of opportunity for their students, mainly our.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8749.793s">[Intoppa]</a>: students who are from other countries, because that helps with visas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8755.379s">[Intoppa]</a>: By changing it to com design and by changing some of the GL class identifications, it actually makes it part of STEM in some way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8762.506s">[Intoppa]</a>: So that may open us up to some other grant opportunities, whether that be a future educator who's a visiting artist or maybe a part-time employee<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8771.269s">[Intoppa]</a>: but also to upgrade what we have as a shop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8774.893s">[Intoppa]</a>: So that discussion of possibly, and when you change the comm design is more, I guess, theory based and it is more, you know, a lot of the education is more surrounding the whys and strategy which when folks go if they choose to go to places like MassArt or other higher education institutions,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8793.151s">[Intoppa]</a>: It almost better serves them if they are getting that communication design, which is still very similar graphic design education, but it almost gears them up more for that thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8804.334s">[Intoppa]</a>: I know like, you know, it's one of the smallest here, but at SR it's the largest department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8809.675s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I don't think people fully realize the benefits to a graphic designer communication design education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8817.726s">[Intoppa]</a>: I don't think people view it too much as an art thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8820.387s">[Intoppa]</a>: But I know some institutions, it's almost looked down upon in their vocational schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8824.569s">[Intoppa]</a>: But I feel like the opportunities are very, I mean, you can't go anywhere without a graphic designer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8831.071s">[Intoppa]</a>: Everyone's hiring them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=8841.856s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=302.21s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=304.131s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=306.272s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=403.905s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=405.766s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=5716.858s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6447.865s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6450.067s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7083.47s">[Intoppa]</a>: I mean, I also just wanted to share my love for Director Intoppa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7087.093s">[Intoppa]</a>: Francis is phenomenal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7089.694s">[Intoppa]</a>: But also, I guess it's a question for you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7093.357s">[Intoppa]</a>: So we heard concerns about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7097.895s">[Intoppa]</a>: This being a huge undertaking and using this to train our administration as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7101.636s">[Intoppa]</a>: Wouldn't we have to vote yes on this anyways to give her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7106.537s">[Intoppa]</a>: To be able to allow her to train school members or in any way, like, would we have to allow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7111.718s">[Intoppa]</a>: Um, consolidation language for support regardless to enact that or to, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7120.879s">[Intoppa]</a>: Give her some of those, those resources to train staff and to make that happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7186.457s">[Intoppa]</a>: I have no doubt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7188.559s">[Intoppa]</a>: That wasn't, I'm sorry, that wasn't the point of my question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7190.581s">[Intoppa]</a>: That was just a hypothetical, just like a question of if that route were to be explored, where it was just a support and like a training factor, if we needed to take that vote anyways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7202.092s">[Intoppa]</a>: That was just my question, but no, I completely understand and I can only imagine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7206.773s">[Intoppa]</a>: But it sounds like Superintendent Edouard-Vincent has some pointers or Member Olapade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7212.434s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'm not sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7212.854s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'm not sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7215.295s">[Intoppa]</a>: But I yield my time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7476.105s">[Intoppa]</a>: I was just going to make another amendment to, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7481.089s">[Intoppa]</a>: A lot of the temporary work until January 1 alongside sending its committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7487.193s">[Intoppa]</a>: But, um, that's dependent on if you want to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7490.956s">[Intoppa]</a>: Take the amendment or not, but just to revisit it, if it's as dire as you're saying, and I are the same, you know, if this is unauthorized work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7498.223s">[Intoppa]</a>: You know, I don't, I can't wrap my head around that right now, but if this is work that needs to be directly done and needs to make, ensure that our families are getting the needs that they need, then I would be comfortable authorizing temporarily to be revisited on January 1 after findings from the subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7516.034s">[Intoppa]</a>: And that's the, I motion to amend that original motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8111.328s">[Intoppa]</a>: I was just going to say that I accept the amendment to the amendment of including the language of July 1 through December 31.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8250.325s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8323.684s">[Intoppa]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8335.412s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8337.614s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2274.713s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2279.977s">[Intoppa]</a>: And thank you, Mayor, for also the clarification on the possible, the fact that we just still don't know what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2288.745s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I find that deeply unsettling, and we gotta figure that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2292.548s">[Intoppa]</a>: My questions with the data presented, do we know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2297.572s">[Intoppa]</a>: It's listed here, the Medford High Complex is listed as one item line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2301.296s">[Intoppa]</a>: Do we know the breakdown of faucets or fixtures, I guess is the better phrase, that are impacted in the high school versus the vocational buildings?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2313.19s">[Intoppa]</a>: Do we know the proportional difference between the two if one was more impacted than the other?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2325.252s">[Intoppa]</a>: Okay, no, that was just one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2336.525s">[Intoppa]</a>: OK, cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2337.326s">[Intoppa]</a>: No, I just wanted a clarification on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2338.866s">[Intoppa]</a>: And then also curious as to why, looking at the numbers again, why the two middle schools with the Andrews being impacted the most with above 15 parts per billion with 52 fixtures affected and the McGlynn Middle School with 33.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2358.411s">[Intoppa]</a>: I guess that has to go with the investigation when it comes to why it's happening and what it's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2363.913s">[Intoppa]</a>: But that is a stark number and difference compared to the rest of our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2371.937s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I'm not sure what that says for the data, but I just want to make a comment about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2375.998s">[Intoppa]</a>: And then in terms of turnaround with data, do we know what the appropriate time is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2380.28s">[Intoppa]</a>: Because the last number I saw was June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2383.117s">[Intoppa]</a>: Do we know when the turnaround is for when we should be getting this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2386.642s">[Intoppa]</a>: Like when we do testing, how long does it take to usually get results back?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2401.784s">[Intoppa]</a>: Sounds good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2403.706s">[Intoppa]</a>: I think that's all I have, but just wanted to thank MassDV for doing this great work and for helping us figure this all out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2412.072s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah, that's all I have to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2413.233s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7177.78s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7231.067s">[Intoppa]</a>: Hello?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7236.371s">[Intoppa]</a>: Is this still feedbacking?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7237.652s">[Intoppa]</a>: No, we're good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10533.596s">[Intoppa]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11190.121s">[Intoppa]</a>: I sort of piggyback, thank you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11192.562s">[Intoppa]</a>: I also piggyback the comments of my peers surrounding the MCAS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11196.543s">[Intoppa]</a>: I used to be joked about that I was gonna run for school committee when I was at the Missatuck because I was so against the MCAS and it's actually my grandfather who was a long time educator in Wilmington retired early because of this becoming a requirement for graduation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11213.808s">[Intoppa]</a>: I've also heard horror stories of students who were capable and were great students, but you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11219.844s">[Intoppa]</a>: due to whatever, you know, it's an equity issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11221.886s">[Intoppa]</a>: It's a quality issue of accessibility and they could not, almost did not graduate because of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11229.391s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I am very much in support of that first question, 100% of, not to, I mean, I was able to afford higher education because of the MCAS because I was able to get a scholarship because of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11240.4s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I'm very fortunate and privileged that that was a thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11244.443s">[Intoppa]</a>: So yes, the unfortunate misconception that we're just getting rid of it and like, what happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11248.966s">[Intoppa]</a>: if we get rid of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11250.307s">[Intoppa]</a>: We're just getting rid of it as a requirement to move on to higher education or wherever you may want to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11257.43s">[Intoppa]</a>: So for question two, I'm a huge, huge supporter of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11260.651s">[Intoppa]</a>: So yeah, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2959.409s">[Intoppa]</a>: Member Intapa?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2960.93s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2961.571s">[Intoppa]</a>: This probably isn't an important question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2963.953s">[Intoppa]</a>: This is just me being curious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2965.254s">[Intoppa]</a>: What CAD program are they teaching the kids?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2967.436s">[Intoppa]</a>: Are they teaching them SolidWorks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2969.178s">[Intoppa]</a>: I have no idea what the name of the program is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2970.759s">[Intoppa]</a>: Because it looks like the program that I was taught in college.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2973.862s">[Intoppa]</a>: So the fact that we're teaching these students such a, I mean, like it might not be, but it looks just like that program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2981.889s">[Intoppa]</a>: I use it at a college level and at an industry level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2984.471s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I just want to...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3004.395s">[Intoppa]</a>: I wish I had that when I was, like, that's crazy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3009.278s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3009.678s">[Intoppa]</a>: That's the only time you can get, but it's... I wanted to take that, I'm sorry, my mic is echoing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3015.703s">[Intoppa]</a>: everywhere um i'll speak softer um i just want to echo how great that is um because again like this is these are this is the time to learn these programs and you know it'll excel the future um through that so that i just wanted to send my regards is awesome thank you great thank you very much<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10442.964s">[Intoppa]</a>: Point of clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10444.264s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10444.664s">[Intoppa]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10445.085s">[Intoppa]</a>: Point of clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10446.165s">[Intoppa]</a>: My sincerest condolences to the family of Robin Irving, who was a McGlynn Middle School educator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10455.489s">[Intoppa]</a>: Just wanted to point that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10456.93s">[Intoppa]</a>: I also just wanted to say real quickly, because I know some of his family might be on the call and as a representative of the class of 2019, just really echo my sincere condolences to the family of Wade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10470.444s">[Intoppa]</a>: I've been trying to figure out how to really feel about this whole situation as we've all seen it play out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10478.857s">[Intoppa]</a>: But I wanted to just tell a quick story because I feel like it's an important message.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10482.563s">[Intoppa]</a>: I know it's late, but I'll make it quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10485.808s">[Intoppa]</a>: When the class lost a Pervative Coda in 2019, we were all extremely grief-stricken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10493.676s">[Intoppa]</a>: And about two years later, Wade actually reached out to me because he had known me working on scholarship.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10500.602s">[Intoppa]</a>: And he was like, hey, man, I'm sorry to bother you on your personal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10503.685s">[Intoppa]</a>: I was like, it's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10504.446s">[Intoppa]</a>: You can always reach out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10506.248s">[Intoppa]</a>: And he was like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10508.024s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'm really, you know, I was really close with him and I really wanted to do something for him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10512.932s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I don't know what to do, but I really want to do this thing that as a man of faith, he wanted to do a proxy baptism.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10521.537s">[Intoppa]</a>: And he had said, you know, but I really want to make sure I do this right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10525.22s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I really want to make sure that I go through the proper channels and I talk with the family because, you know, I could go to their door if I wanted to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10532.225s">[Intoppa]</a>: But, you know, I don't I don't want to do this right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10536.468s">[Intoppa]</a>: And so we talked with the family and we we got their approval and he went through with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10543.232s">[Intoppa]</a>: He was able to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10545.594s">[Intoppa]</a>: But, you know, something that Wade really stood for, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10549.474s">[Intoppa]</a>: making sure we care for and consider for and love one another even when no one is looking because he didn't have to do that but he did and he made sure that he was at peace and the family was at peace through no incidentals and i really just employ everyone listening that as we sort of navigate this grief to use the power of community and to check in on one another<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10575.925s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I implore you all to text or reach out to in any way that you can, however you feel like you can, to someone you haven't talked to in a while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10586.209s">[Intoppa]</a>: And to just really, really build that sense of community through what we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10591.45s">[Intoppa]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=1170.45s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=1193.842s">[Intoppa]</a>: So moved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5025.999s">[Intoppa]</a>: And thank you everyone for giving this valuable information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5028.82s">[Intoppa]</a>: I think, you know, from what it sounds like the city, your program is a phenomenal program to help, you know, professionally develop students, you know, at a time in their life after high school, uh, my initial concern was about the funding portion, but the a hundred thousand or the 200,000 and, you know, scraping from revolving funds or from the before and after school program, because I know we're still, we're, it's on the agenda tonight to talk about the budget and we're, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5053.885s">[Intoppa]</a>: It's not ideal what we're doing in the budget, and we're trying to fit in a $100,000, possibly $200,000 program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5060.612s">[Intoppa]</a>: that I don't know if spend budgeted for in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5063.733s">[Intoppa]</a>: And that part sort of just concerns me a little bit, I guess, to put it out there before we vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5070.815s">[Intoppa]</a>: And also, is this vote to start negotiations, to start talks, or is this vote to approve the actual program?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5079.877s">[Intoppa]</a>: Because while it seems like an amazing program, and from what I could tell, it really is, I just have concerns about bringing it in a time<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5086.619s">[Intoppa]</a>: where we're doing layoffs and scraping revolving funds to just get by for a level service, and we're trying to introduce more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5095.702s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I'm sorry to be so negative about that, but that's just sort of where my concerns are at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6446.996s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6449.298s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6451.259s">[Intoppa]</a>: Abstain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6638.137s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7542.342s">[Intoppa]</a>: I second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7576.812s">[Intoppa]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8105.436s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you vice chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8106.777s">[Intoppa]</a>: Graham Jerry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8108.138s">[Intoppa]</a>: I just want to take a moment and make a few thank yous 1 for creating this detailed report and giving a history lesson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8115.224s">[Intoppa]</a>: So that someone who missed everything and may have been like, wait, what happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8119.307s">[Intoppa]</a>: And, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8120.928s">[Intoppa]</a>: This tells the story of what happened and sort of what's been going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8126.412s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I really want to thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8127.913s">[Intoppa]</a>: I was actually talking to someone the other day about transparency and with budgeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8131.936s">[Intoppa]</a>: And they were like, well, is it going up?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8133.237s">[Intoppa]</a>: Is transparency going down?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8134.158s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'm like, it seems like it's going up with the packet I just received.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8137.941s">[Intoppa]</a>: We're getting all this information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8139.422s">[Intoppa]</a>: And that's conversations on record, all these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8142.424s">[Intoppa]</a>: So just thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8143.705s">[Intoppa]</a>: And to also hear that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8145.947s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah, of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8146.888s">[Intoppa]</a>: I also want to say, as I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8149.963s">[Intoppa]</a>: I don't want to sound nonchalant when I talk about cuts, but I do want to acknowledge that these are people's lives and positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8154.926s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I don't want it to seem so casual when I, when we discuss this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8159.448s">[Intoppa]</a>: Um, so I want to acknowledge that and all the people who made their voices heard, but Jerry, just a quick question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8164.45s">[Intoppa]</a>: So in here with page 13, it talks about adding back positions that were cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8171.894s">[Intoppa]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8178.283s">[Intoppa]</a>: So the, and maybe I just misread.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8180.544s">[Intoppa]</a>: So this is why, this is why we asked the questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8183.325s">[Intoppa]</a>: Um, so the performing arts director, the assistant director of athletics, are those all positions now funded through the budget because they're not listed here anymore?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8225.737s">[Intoppa]</a>: So the director of performing arts is still is still out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8230.36s">[Intoppa]</a>: Understood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8230.921s">[Intoppa]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8233.183s">[Intoppa]</a>: Um, just wanted to double check because as much as I just talked about transparency, that just wasn't clear and wanted to double check with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8239.787s">[Intoppa]</a>: Um, I think at this moment, that's all I have, but if another question arise, I will let it be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9871.38s">[Intoppa]</a>: I was hoping to possibly make an amendment to also add into the language to find a way to increase the stipend pay for the band director with the idea that the pay that it is at may not be attractive to external candidates and that there will be a significant decline in the program's activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9893.956s">[Intoppa]</a>: Is it contractual?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9898.579s">[Intoppa]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9899.44s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9984.142s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9985.282s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you for the clarity, Vice Chair Grammich.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9986.963s">[Intoppa]</a>: I could actually<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9988.384s">[Intoppa]</a>: make an, I don't know if this is an amendment making an amendment, if Member Ruseau is making the amendment herself, if I could second the amendment to increase funds available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9999.892s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes, I would be willing to adapt that language, amend my amendment to amend to that language for the amendment of your motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10008.038s">[Intoppa]</a>: So be it there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11609.579s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11643.982s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11659.436s">[Intoppa]</a>: So moved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11684.147s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=4709.946s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes, thank you miss Bowen for this report I just had a quick question just because it's my first time sitting on this committee or these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=4716.694s">[Intoppa]</a>: So the ones that are partially implemented in terms of trends in the past years, is this something that is abnormal normal that were partially implemented in these areas, or just curious to see if there's a trend going on of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=4731.334s">[Intoppa]</a>: missing the same things or are we or is this all new, so it's all new information that Jesse was looking at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=4766.639s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah I just want to make sure yeah because these things you know like I understand there's a lot but these are sort of things that we need to make sure that we are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=4773.202s">[Intoppa]</a>: fully implemented all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=4774.786s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I just wanted, I was just curious to see if this is something historically the district has lacked on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6909.878s">[Intoppa]</a>: Awesome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6910.219s">[Intoppa]</a>: I just want to say thank you very much, Director Fee for presenting all this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6915.06s">[Intoppa]</a>: I just want to also say that I have the distinct pleasure of working at an art institution and being a graduate of an art institution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6922.363s">[Intoppa]</a>: And by doing that, I get to see what everyone from around the state and around the country is producing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6929.425s">[Intoppa]</a>: Watching our Studio Foundation students go through the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6932.166s">[Intoppa]</a>: the system, working with students all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6935.147s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I can comfortably say I think for the first time that Medford is excelling in the arts and I'm really, really pleased to see all the work that's presented, I mean these are just the award winners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6945.131s">[Intoppa]</a>: We don't know what people are crafting personally what's in their full portfolios, and just, it's really refreshing to see this much attention to the arts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6954.774s">[Intoppa]</a>: and seeing how many people were involved in the level that they're at, at grade 10, grade 11, seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6960.618s">[Intoppa]</a>: So whether or not they pursue to do an art education, which I know some of the winners are, but I just want to say like, this is phenomenal work and thank you and congratulations to everyone who won an award and hopefully we'll see what you do next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=6974.246s">[Intoppa]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1790.037s">[Intoppa]</a>: I also just wanted to take a second and just recognize how important this program is to our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1795.8s">[Intoppa]</a>: I actually, unfortunately, only got a chance to be a part of it my senior year in high school, but that was the cohort that witnessed it go to the elementary and middle school level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1804.985s">[Intoppa]</a>: And just seeing how much it's grown in only what I like to say two years, but it's been like five or six now, is absolutely amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1813.349s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I'm so proud of you guys and everyone who's involved to get up here and speak and do what you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1818.872s">[Intoppa]</a>: This program really takes you know when you take a moment and look at students special interests and you look at what they want to do to give back to the community and you fund that and you encourage them to do it, you see such an increase in their overall academic success and their participation in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1836.881s">[Intoppa]</a>: the social emotional learning skills that you get.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1839.802s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I just, I really, you know, seeing what happened and seeing the unfortunate incident that happened and just immediately coming to action and then doing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1847.885s">[Intoppa]</a>: I just, I can't commend you guys enough and I can't wait to see what you guys do next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1852.187s">[Intoppa]</a>: I really can't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1852.887s">[Intoppa]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1853.987s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8696.916s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8698.755s">[Intoppa]</a>: I again, want to just say that my comments are more comments than questions, maybe a little bit of both, but wanted to take the opportunity to sort of give my concerns to also let people know that they are heard because a lot of them are from the many, many emails that we have gotten over the last two to three weeks, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8721.161s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I just want to take a moment and apologize to those who I wasn't able to get to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8724.662s">[Intoppa]</a>: immediately right away but really appreciate you reaching out with your personal experience and things that are going on and your concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8734.491s">[Intoppa]</a>: Again, some of the things, I'm really concerned about us bouncing back and sort of, not bouncing back, really relying on the staffing recommendations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8744.677s">[Intoppa]</a>: I feel like, you know, May is mental health awareness month and we are in a mental health epidemic in crisis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8750.941s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I'm really, really concerned about the amount of nursing, the health cuts, as well as the guidance Councilor cuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8757.865s">[Intoppa]</a>: I know there are adjustment Councilors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8759.086s">[Intoppa]</a>: I know we still have 17 of those in this proposed budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8762.248s">[Intoppa]</a>: However,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8763.749s">[Intoppa]</a>: The ease of access to students are the nurses, those are the people who if you are having a panic attack, you go right to the nurses, I have done that numerous times at the high school, it is someone where if you don't know where to go, that is a safe haven, and I know the high school still has three, but that's just an example of, you know, later on, however, I worry about the ones that you know the one full time I know there's some sharing going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8786.104s">[Intoppa]</a>: I made the comment at the last meeting and we'll make it again about how one can be a little dangerous, especially when it comes to medication at all levels, you know, you can't be administered education, I mean, you can't be administered medication without a nurse present you can't not give it to yourself, whether you are seven or you are 19 that is just not a possibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8809.065s">[Intoppa]</a>: And so I wanted to really push back on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8812.069s">[Intoppa]</a>: You know, I'm, you know, seeing go from six to four but still really concerned about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8817.295s">[Intoppa]</a>: A lot of my other concerns have already been echoed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8820.679s">[Intoppa]</a>: When it comes to the performing arts I'm really happy to hear that you know there's going to be a stipend position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8825.905s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'm really concerned about a stipend position to fund the marching band and color guard because that is such an intensive program in our education system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8833.847s">[Intoppa]</a>: I was an orchestra kid, so I got to witness firsthand how much, you know, work they put in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8838.708s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I also want to make a comment that I didn't make earlier, but, you know, we made a comment about how many people were repeating and repeatedly standing up with our students, but I want to notice how many of our humanity success stories had a performing arts marching band and color guard garments on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8871.977s">[Intoppa]</a>: It's a lot, it's a lot of work, and I've seen it and I worry that when we start to stipend or we start to do that the work may not be, I don't want to say appealing to someone but it's not enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8884.783s">[Intoppa]</a>: And oftentimes what that happens is it creates a work environment that is too tiring and then people leave and then we don't want people you know that we've had here for 14 years that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8893.467s">[Intoppa]</a>: really love the work, but then can't afford to do the work anymore, so they make that tough decision to leave, and then we can't find someone to replace them because no one wants to do that work for however much money that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8904.398s">[Intoppa]</a>: So those are some of the big concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8905.499s">[Intoppa]</a>: That was a lot of the concerns we had gotten in emails was about the performing arts position directly in the state of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8910.904s">[Intoppa]</a>: I know there was a lot of misinformation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8912.206s">[Intoppa]</a>: I know there was a lot of talk about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8913.807s">[Intoppa]</a>: the performing arts program being slashed or cut entirely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8917.608s">[Intoppa]</a>: But that's one of the main concerns I have as someone who sees that sort of on a day-to-day about, you know, people being underpaid, people wanting to have these ambitions and not being able to fulfill them because of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8928.57s">[Intoppa]</a>: The performing arts, there's a huge, you know, it was actually said in an email that reminded me of the term social-emotional learning and, you know, how the academic access, again, what we just showed, the academic success that our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8941.073s">[Intoppa]</a>: our students have when they are in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8944.575s">[Intoppa]</a>: So that's sort of where my now new concern is with the stipend positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8949.037s">[Intoppa]</a>: I appreciate there's money being put there, however, that condition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8952.9s">[Intoppa]</a>: That also translates to the Missituk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8954.44s">[Intoppa]</a>: I was talking to some of my former teachers, which is crazy to think that, you know, seeing them here today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8960.724s">[Intoppa]</a>: I was reminded by one of my teachers that was pregnant when I had them, and they showed me a photo of their 16-year-old son.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8967.187s">[Intoppa]</a>: And it made me just really, really think back to the time that I was there, and it was the Missittuc, really concerned at the number of positions that's being cut there, especially, you know, a lot of people had said that the class sizes aren't what are as advertised, that we have a lot of staff members really doing the part of their job description that's other duties is assigned, covering for each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8987.018s">[Intoppa]</a>: And how many of our, you know, language learning students<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8992.021s">[Intoppa]</a>: are there and how we are cutting down at a school where we send a lot of people who need maybe extra aid there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8998.285s">[Intoppa]</a>: And so that's a huge concern of mine, and one that I wanted to echo from the thousands of comments and people who are here today to talk about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9007.63s">[Intoppa]</a>: I feel like there's definitely some more comments that have definitely been reshared, so I won't go through some of that, but I just want to, again, thank everyone who's here today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9014.913s">[Intoppa]</a>: And thank you, Jerry, for, again, being transparent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9017.575s">[Intoppa]</a>: I know this isn't easy to do, and I appreciate being able to look at the numbers and see them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=9023.7s">[Intoppa]</a>: But those are sort of some of my high-level concerns, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10038.951s">[Intoppa]</a>: Point of clarification before we move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10043.493s">[Intoppa]</a>: Point of clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10044.453s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10045.734s">[Intoppa]</a>: I just wanted to not to stir the pot, but in reference to student members' wrongs with the payroll managerial positions, I think there was some also concern from the union about those usually being administrative assistant roles and then them being non-union.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10059.538s">[Intoppa]</a>: Is that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10060.718s">[Intoppa]</a>: still a proposed effort?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10062.901s">[Intoppa]</a>: I just want to get clarification if that's changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=12369.626s">[Intoppa]</a>: Point of clarification, vice chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=12371.707s">[Intoppa]</a>: Point of clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=12373.948s">[Intoppa]</a>: I know that we made a motion earlier to strike the addresses of our student members in the minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=12379.51s">[Intoppa]</a>: Would it make sense to suspend the rules or make a motion to strike the students who have to speak further to give their address when they speak at the podium for minutes or?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=12395.459s">[Intoppa]</a>: I just want to clarify and make that note to the students that they don't have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=12399.582s">[Intoppa]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=12400.043s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=12400.603s">[Intoppa]</a>: They have your name and address for the record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18552.759s">[Intoppa]</a>: point of clarification, is this number with all the cuts or without the cuts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18560.465s">[Intoppa]</a>: So this number that we're putting forward is a request to the municipal government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18569.773s">[Intoppa]</a>: It's a request, but it is the first step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18573.516s">[Intoppa]</a>: What I should clarify in my clarification is, is this number, because I'm getting confused with the language again, I'm on the job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18582.362s">[Intoppa]</a>: Is this number one that reflects the cuts in our packet or is this one that is the level one that is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18589.526s">[Intoppa]</a>: This is level service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18590.847s">[Intoppa]</a>: This is level service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18591.788s">[Intoppa]</a>: If we do not, so this does not include the cutting of the director of performing arts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18595.751s">[Intoppa]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18596.751s">[Intoppa]</a>: That's all I would.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18598.012s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18601.213s">[Intoppa]</a>: It's very important to know what we vote on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18605.754s">[Intoppa]</a>: Everyone else understands what we're voting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18607.854s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18608.134s">[Intoppa]</a>: I do not feel comfortable voting on a budget that has this many cuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18611.115s">[Intoppa]</a>: But if this number that we are putting forward, then yes, the bottom number, not the top number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18713.874s">[Intoppa]</a>: Can you turn on your mic?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18714.935s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes, thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18716.897s">[Intoppa]</a>: So point of clarification for the fifth time, recommendation on the consent agenda, we did not vote to recommend to approve the $3,000 grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=0.393s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes, yep, I will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2.955s">[Intoppa]</a>: OK, we are live on YouTube, and let me record it locally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=8.099s">[Intoppa]</a>: Record to the cloud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=11.141s">[Intoppa]</a>: And make host.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=15.344s">[Intoppa]</a>: All right, have a great meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=16.325s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=18.126s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=64.031s">[Intoppa]</a>: I can read it out for you if you'd like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=72.426s">[Intoppa]</a>: Sure, so the meeting ID is 91810757989, with the Zoom meeting link being mps02155-org.zoom.us, forward slash J, forward slash 918177, 757, sorry, 989.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=805.94s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah, so quick question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=807.101s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I guess it's more of like a point of clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=810.6s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'm assuming this is sort of the point the school council's made up of like students, staff, faculty, is this the point for them to kind of give their feedback on like, we're finding that this isn't working or this like we've noticed this uptake in this and we need to do something about it like is this the community's chance to sort of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=914.79s">[Intoppa]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=914.971s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah, because I guess I'm more thinking about when the users of the handbook can give feedback on what they're seeing made, like when that period would be essential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=925.214s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I wasn't sure if that was the time for it or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1335.228s">[Intoppa]</a>: Could we say singular complete approval, meaning it's a, like, it has to be complete, a complete approval of a singular handbook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1343.551s">[Intoppa]</a>: Could that phrasing just before approval, make sense, or is there like some caveat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1364.334s">[Intoppa]</a>: I guess I mean, singular, complete.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1370.816s">[Intoppa]</a>: By singular, I mean, like, this is the McGlynn handbook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1373.257s">[Intoppa]</a>: This is the Brooks handbook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1374.478s">[Intoppa]</a>: If we approve one of them, that is a singular, complete approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1387.034s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah, that's a good message, really, really good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2938.873s">[Intoppa]</a>: Okay, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2941.514s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thing I have to notice, which is the typo on phase 3.2 mandatory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2953.52s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2954.702s">[Intoppa]</a>: Oh, I googled it just in case I didn't understand linguistics for a second, but member member and Tapa has been finding Dory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2974.787s">[Intoppa]</a>: Google Docs does it automatically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2987.383s">[Intoppa]</a>: I mean, the timeframe seemed logistical to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2989.685s">[Intoppa]</a>: I appreciate the cushion to an RN of like, hey, if these things need to get moved back, ours is significant so that way we're the ones who are kind of paid to do the work and can kind of speed things along if we have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3002.857s">[Intoppa]</a>: But like in my experience of drafting policy and drafting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3007.936s">[Intoppa]</a>: Dates, we did it with elections with our student council and like, it was like, it looked great on paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3013.362s">[Intoppa]</a>: It's like, this makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3014.443s">[Intoppa]</a>: And then they just executed the constitute the new constitution this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3018.146s">[Intoppa]</a>: And it was like, no, we need to, we need to do this a lot earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3020.789s">[Intoppa]</a>: So it'll be something we live and learn that we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3025.594s">[Intoppa]</a>: But logistically, having a month for initiation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3255.519s">[Intoppa]</a>: I don't really have any further questions or comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3512.205s">[Intoppa]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3514.205s">[Intoppa]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3764.85s">[Intoppa]</a>: No, that sounds about right to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3766.211s">[Intoppa]</a>: If it's outside of the time we're dialoguing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3768.293s">[Intoppa]</a>: But no, that does make sense to amend it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3770.675s">[Intoppa]</a>: But right, if this was April 28th, we'd be having a different conversation, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3776.239s">[Intoppa]</a>: In fact, it's May 8th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3777.3s">[Intoppa]</a>: I think we're OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3780.363s">[Intoppa]</a>: That's my sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3783.288s">[Intoppa]</a>: But I didn't even think about that, member Ratcliffe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3785.189s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you for bringing that up, because that would have been fun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3863.684s">[Intoppa]</a>: We just got an email saying that we have them and that physical copies will be given to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3871.672s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah, no, like, like literally 20 minutes ago, we got the three of them, and we will be giving hard copies out for the May 20 meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3915.362s">[Intoppa]</a>: So moved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5408.163s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5410.065s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you, Jerry, for putting this together and very transparent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5414.029s">[Intoppa]</a>: While I don't agree with, you know, all these cuts that we're doing, I really appreciate being able to see where we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5419.835s">[Intoppa]</a>: There's not a lot of guessing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5420.936s">[Intoppa]</a>: We can actually see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5424.473s">[Intoppa]</a>: I am very new to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5426.235s">[Intoppa]</a>: I've been in two months to the day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5429.137s">[Intoppa]</a>: So my apologies if my ignorance or my lack of understanding precedes what I'm about to sort of talk about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5436.124s">[Intoppa]</a>: It's the only way you can learn it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5437.825s">[Intoppa]</a>: I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5438.245s">[Intoppa]</a>: I dive into the deep end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5440.567s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thought possible two and a half million deficit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5443.31s">[Intoppa]</a>: Now it's 250.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5444.391s">[Intoppa]</a>: Like diving in the deep end real hard right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5447.734s">[Intoppa]</a>: Some emails that I've gotten<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5449.535s">[Intoppa]</a>: in particular are around performing arts, athletics, nurses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5455.499s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I thought, I guess these are more comments than questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5459.721s">[Intoppa]</a>: And again, I wish I knew how to find the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5462.163s">[Intoppa]</a>: I wish I understood that, but I just don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5464.084s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I apologize if I'm not giving too many solutions, just more of the concerns that I have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5469.667s">[Intoppa]</a>: Performing arts is on a decline, and by cutting that, I'm really nervous about the direction we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5475.489s">[Intoppa]</a>: Performing arts aren't just an activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5477.369s">[Intoppa]</a>: It is how we integrate culture, how we keep tradition, how we keep things alive in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5484.231s">[Intoppa]</a>: And, you know, we just had a great performance from our drama club with Mama Mia, and also just some other initiatives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5490.033s">[Intoppa]</a>: You know, we're seeing them give back to the community in ways that, you know, I couldn't even have imagined when I was at Medford High.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5495.934s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I really...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5499.807s">[Intoppa]</a>: You know, we just named the office after, you know, former school committee member, Lita DiGianto-Masso, and I'm afraid by going down this path, we're sort of going back what she was fighting against.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5511.535s">[Intoppa]</a>: You know, the performing arts are a huge staple to how we keep the users of our schools there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5521.461s">[Intoppa]</a>: In terms of, what was I talking about, nurses, I was a student with,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5528.11s">[Intoppa]</a>: medication that had to be stored.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5529.352s">[Intoppa]</a>: And one of the things that I think I am not seeing sort of brought up is also, you know, we cut nurses, we're also cutting the facts that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5536.65s">[Intoppa]</a>: I even in the upper levels could not take my medication without a nurse being there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5542.713s">[Intoppa]</a>: That includes epinephrine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5544.154s">[Intoppa]</a>: If I don't carry an EpiPen on me, there's one stored there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5546.595s">[Intoppa]</a>: We need someone to be able to run around the maze that is Mephiti Complex to find someone who may need to administer it, as well as I need to find time out of my day to go and meet with one of those nurses, hoping there's one not helping another student to take the medication that allowed me to help me learn every single day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5563.123s">[Intoppa]</a>: So that's sort of one of the things that I just wanted to say in support of the nurses here and just wanted to give that insight because I'm not really seeing that being mentioned, but no one really sees that unless they experience it like I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5574.194s">[Intoppa]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5581.922s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5582.532s">[Intoppa]</a>: And it's just, it's not even just the high school, it's the elementary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5584.552s">[Intoppa]</a>: I've been taking medications since elementary school, um, elementary school, middle school and high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5589.513s">[Intoppa]</a>: Um, and so that, that doesn't really change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5591.434s">[Intoppa]</a>: So it was always packed to even back then when I was there in 2019.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5596.455s">[Intoppa]</a>: Um, so I'm really, really concerned about how many, you know, employees were cutting, uh, in terms of athletics, um, that department in terms of it's already thin enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5605.636s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I, I'm not sure what position was cut in the athletics department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5613.299s">[Intoppa]</a>: One of the administrative?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5616.46s">[Intoppa]</a>: Because the assistant athletic director that I know that's in there is like the backbone of that entire athletics department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5622.582s">[Intoppa]</a>: And that is no diss to anyone in that department at all, but the individual who is in that is at everything I've ever been to and is there to make sure that that program stays running.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5640.676s">[Intoppa]</a>: So really looking at, you know, it's numbers but it's also people and support, and who are they going to lean on if they're the ones there all the time anyways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5648.659s">[Intoppa]</a>: And then in terms of, you know, looking at technology spending, we've sort of digged ourselves into this hole of relying on Chromebooks and technology because of the pandemic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5658.716s">[Intoppa]</a>: I guess when it comes to technology, as someone who's used that technology pre-pandemic, knowing how unreliable it can be, I'm a little concerned about pumping more money into it until we figure out a solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5668.419s">[Intoppa]</a>: Because I feel like every other Chromebook had a missing key.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5671.56s">[Intoppa]</a>: And also, I'm a little concerned about putting so much money towards tablets for kindergartners instead of the support that they need to help teach those kindergartners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5687.236s">[Intoppa]</a>: hands-on learning tactile that, I mean, I'm not an educator, but I just happen to be a designer and an artist and know just the value of tactile hands-on learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5696.682s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I would almost rather look, see that money, if that money had to go towards something, be more towards school supplies or hands-on learning than electronics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5704.167s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I don't know how that makes me sound, but I don't feel like our kindergartners need tablets, they need people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5711.112s">[Intoppa]</a>: And so that's a lot of what I have to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5713.193s">[Intoppa]</a>: And there's a lot of things, obviously, you know, I'm happy to see more increase in special education services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5719.517s">[Intoppa]</a>: But there are a lot of alarming factors that I don't know if I fully wrapped my head around in the last 48 hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5726.3s">[Intoppa]</a>: And, you know, thank you to everyone who's here to speak on behalf.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5729.602s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I'm sorry by taking up more of the time that doesn't allow you to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5733.98s">[Intoppa]</a>: I just wanna say that there's, I may have more questions or comments going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5738.304s">[Intoppa]</a>: For now, that's what I have, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5816.839s">[Intoppa]</a>: Right, and I think, I'm sorry, just a point of clarification, I guess on my point, is it to cut technology?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5821.321s">[Intoppa]</a>: It's more to look at and consult our users who are administering it to see where they might find it best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5826.463s">[Intoppa]</a>: Do we need to invest more in technology?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5828.363s">[Intoppa]</a>: I don't have a teaching degree, so I don't really know what that is like, but.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5833.625s">[Intoppa]</a>: definitely leaning more on our professionals that are our faculty to see where there are technological gaps and fixes on a day-to-day classroom basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5841.527s">[Intoppa]</a>: So thank you for the clarification as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=5844.108s">[Intoppa]</a>: Again, appreciate the work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5538.364s">[Intoppa]</a>: Hey all, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5539.885s">[Intoppa]</a>: I had a question as well for the previous, well not a question, more of a statement for the previous presentation as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5546.769s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you both for presenting all this really wonderful information as someone who actually holds a bachelor's in art and design education with a design degree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5567.879s">[Intoppa]</a>: as Miss Rowland knows, as I went through the many programs she hosts as well, proud product of, you know, the theater and everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5575.403s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'm going to be guidance over Tony's idea as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5579.044s">[Intoppa]</a>: But just wanted to really echo my, I can't say speechless because I'm talking too much right now, and also apologize I can't be there right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5586.228s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'm coping well with somebody here as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5589.961s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah, I just really want to reading through the slideshow was really happy and also really cool to hear that the band actually needed to be replaced and put in another division.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5598.328s">[Intoppa]</a>: And even then they still did really well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5599.969s">[Intoppa]</a>: So thank you to both for all the work you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5603.172s">[Intoppa]</a>: And yeah, that's all I have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5604.833s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6415.641s">[Intoppa]</a>: Remember, we're mostly the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6419.624s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'm not sure what the motion is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6425.808s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12314.88s">[Intoppa]</a>: Sure, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12316.08s">[Intoppa]</a>: Just a quick question of clarification in the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12319.261s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you, Member Graham, for putting this forward, for seeing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12323.962s">[Intoppa]</a>: So should we motion to amend to invite current and former, also parents, guardians, caregivers as well?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12331.325s">[Intoppa]</a>: Would that be something we need to do or should?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12334.026s">[Intoppa]</a>: I mean, I feel like we should as well for students and staff, but I'm not sure if it's implied in the motion already, if that is the case, but figured I would put that out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12359.426s">[Intoppa]</a>: Oh, awesome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12359.966s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12360.527s">[Intoppa]</a>: I knew it was a it was an open meeting, but I wanted to make sure that the formal invitation was sent to them as well, along with their students, but sorry if it's hard to hear me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=121.04s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=124.401s">[Intoppa]</a>: I don't know what's going off my mic again, but I'm here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=241.101s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=244.903s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3540.459s">[Intoppa]</a>: Of course I am.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3545.001s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'm also just noticing another error in the minutes, so I'm gonna abstain from this one, which might be the same thing that, I'm sorry, clarification, Member Reinfeld, are you mentioning the vote on the stabilization fund?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=3562.27s">[Intoppa]</a>: Okay, so yeah, so as amended, then yes, I vote to approve, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4269.244s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4272.107s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes, with thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4327.758s">[Intoppa]</a>: Motion for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=4413.606s">[Intoppa]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6390.369s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you very much Chair Lungo-Koehn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6396.392s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah I just wanted to put this motion forward to sort of recognize and also I guess more amend our current calendar so I know we have we take a vote in November to put forward days of observance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6408.58s">[Intoppa]</a>: I also want to clarify<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6410.185s">[Intoppa]</a>: This is not a day off holiday I'm looking to put forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6413.147s">[Intoppa]</a>: It is more of a day of observance, day of acknowledgement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6416.71s">[Intoppa]</a>: Currently as it stands, the last calendar I had checked, it is referred to as Autism Awareness Day, Autism Awareness Month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6424.636s">[Intoppa]</a>: And this motion looks to amend that and to change that language, whether it has to get tabled till November or if we can do it right now, which would be preferable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6433.943s">[Intoppa]</a>: So it's where it's already labeled and where it needs to be changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6440.663s">[Intoppa]</a>: The third part of the motion, the clarification about identifying students is how we're looking at how we are screening, screening techniques, as well as looking at ways that parents can come to us as a district to look at receiving services, however, they may need it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6462.592s">[Intoppa]</a>: This is something that I would like in writing and to sort of get a report on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6465.774s">[Intoppa]</a>: I have a personal, this comes from a, and the explanation kind of talks about it, of looking at how we make change and how we are impacted as a former student in the Medford Public Schools with an IEP who belongs in the neurodivergent community on the spectrum of the attention deficit disorder spectrum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6487.623s">[Intoppa]</a>: This is something that I witnessed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6490.359s">[Intoppa]</a>: I witnessed students who had 504s and IEPs, their struggles, how some of them would lose them because they were doing better, which to me makes no sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6500.322s">[Intoppa]</a>: Because if you're doing better on a plan, you're doing better because of the plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6504.022s">[Intoppa]</a>: It helps you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6506.163s">[Intoppa]</a>: So, I'm really looking to see what we are doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6509.284s">[Intoppa]</a>: And this is sort of the 1st kind of steps and looking at how we as a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6515.222s">[Intoppa]</a>: can become allies within the autistic community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6517.803s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'd like to make another point of, um, the use of disorder, um, uh, is not so popular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6524.906s">[Intoppa]</a>: And my apologies for using the official language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6527.867s">[Intoppa]</a>: Um, but also, um, you know, this really, really comes from, um, my personal experience working with those, um, within the autistic community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6537.611s">[Intoppa]</a>: Um, as my buddy Dan puts it best, it's pretty easy for me to make you aware that I have autism and that usually proceeds to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6544.868s">[Intoppa]</a>: But it's really hard for members of the community to accept me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6549.051s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I would like to mitigate that harm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6552.833s">[Intoppa]</a>: We're talking at a higher education level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6554.934s">[Intoppa]</a>: Mitigate the harmful effects that this has on our students before they even get there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6560.998s">[Intoppa]</a>: And as someone who's been looked at funny and scrutinized because of my diagnosis, this is my way of putting steps forward for better allyship.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6572.994s">[Intoppa]</a>: But we also want to look at the success.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6574.895s">[Intoppa]</a>: We want to look more at the success, not so much as a disease needs to be healed, as mentioned in the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6581.718s">[Intoppa]</a>: But I feel like we can't do that until we look at how we are helping and how we are aiding the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6587.861s">[Intoppa]</a>: So that is all I have on the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6722.801s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah, I think, thank you, Dr. Edouard-Vincent for bringing to your concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6728.565s">[Intoppa]</a>: I think that's what I'm just looking to see is what are the procedures we have to follow?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6735.409s">[Intoppa]</a>: That's really, I'm sorry if the phrasing is, this is my first motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6739.912s">[Intoppa]</a>: My apologies if the phrasing is weird.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6742.947s">[Intoppa]</a>: But yeah, I'm looking to see what protocols are from DESE.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6769.742s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah, that would be good as an amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6771.704s">[Intoppa]</a>: I would say a better method would be reports to the Medford School Committee on steps being taken with the Medford Public Schools to support students on the autism spectrum, due to just recommendations from the community on language surrounding how we address it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6798.464s">[Intoppa]</a>: have a motion to amend the calendar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6799.484s">[Intoppa]</a>: I may.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6799.925s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah Member Reinfeld had their hand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6918.559s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6920.099s">[Intoppa]</a>: That would be great to have that conversation with CPAC as well as bring that to the subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6925.702s">[Intoppa]</a>: And also to answer, sorry, to answer the question at hand of the school's calendars to reach the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6934.866s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes, it would amend it to where it is already written to where that to where days of observance are listed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6942.289s">[Intoppa]</a>: Because it has also been brought point of singling out 1 holiday is a concern, which I fully understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6948.391s">[Intoppa]</a>: So, wherever this would naturally be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6952.153s">[Intoppa]</a>: Written is where we would like to see it amended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=6957.068s">[Intoppa]</a>: So yes, all recommendations of amendment are taken into consideration for the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7211.087s">[Intoppa]</a>: Getting it now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7321.665s">[Intoppa]</a>: You should be good to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8916.484s">[Intoppa]</a>: Sorry, the thought was there and then it quickly left.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8919.425s">[Intoppa]</a>: I yield my time to Mr. Guillen if possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=8923.848s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'll re-raise when I think of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9366.206s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you Madam Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9367.746s">[Intoppa]</a>: I would just like to, I've realized the point was more on the lines of the question of Member Branley, but I would like to echo the point made by MTA President Guillen, as well as Chair Lungo-Koehn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9384.41s">[Intoppa]</a>: It does feel a little politician heavy, and I would love to see if we do have a non-voting member addition, because again, the guidelines said one, minus, you know, the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9395.956s">[Intoppa]</a>: You know, the 2 being, you know, member Graham and member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9400.639s">[Intoppa]</a>: And this is no, this is with all due respect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9404.281s">[Intoppa]</a>: This is not a shot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9405.642s">[Intoppa]</a>: I want to make that very clear member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9407.363s">[Intoppa]</a>: So it was a very, very intelligent person, especially when it comes to open meeting law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9413.347s">[Intoppa]</a>: I have I use it as a resource for many questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9416.069s">[Intoppa]</a>: It's just a matter of me wanting to have more of our community members who maybe don't have that say that maybe this board would have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9425.177s">[Intoppa]</a>: And including, especially our teachers, whether that be paraprofessionals, whether that be the people who walk those buildings daily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9435.782s">[Intoppa]</a>: Because they will tell you the ins and outs that evolve every single day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9441.745s">[Intoppa]</a>: So, yeah, I would say that, you know, obviously it's 2 different motions, but I would echo the concerns of chair and would probably want to put to get more 4 to 5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9451.786s">[Intoppa]</a>: I don't know what the legality of having teachers that don't live in our district, because from my understanding, we have quite a few teachers who don't live within the Medford Public Schools who may be eligible to want to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9462.631s">[Intoppa]</a>: I don't know the legality of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9464.252s">[Intoppa]</a>: That's just my own ignorance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9466.873s">[Intoppa]</a>: But if we can open up it to having more than one school member, even as a non-voting member, I don't see why we couldn't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9477.318s">[Intoppa]</a>: But I think that's all the collective thought I have right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9482.216s">[Intoppa]</a>: before I just start talking nonsense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9546.716s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9731.802s">[Intoppa]</a>: I don't know what an alternate means, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9733.523s">[Intoppa]</a>: Point of clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9738.281s">[Intoppa]</a>: I think the point is, is that member Graham in presenting was saying about how MSBA may have a cap of a certain amount of the working groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9748.267s">[Intoppa]</a>: The idea was, is that we approve three, and if we need to cut down to one non-voting member, then we look at the pool of who we want to put forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9755.591s">[Intoppa]</a>: The idea is to have three, and if we can have two, then we have two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9758.193s">[Intoppa]</a>: And if we have three, then we can have three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9798.156s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'd second that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9799.397s">[Intoppa]</a>: Could I add on to that in the statement that they should be priority sent to faculty members of the building that is being built?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9815.861s">[Intoppa]</a>: Right, right, from that pool, yes, from the applicant pool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9820.343s">[Intoppa]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9934.041s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9939.283s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10280.56s">[Intoppa]</a>: I will put forward the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2458.4s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'm sorry, if I can call a point of information real quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2460.683s">[Intoppa]</a>: Jerry, when you mentioned long term sub pay, did you say that they were making $275 a day?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2472.335s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2475.238s">[Intoppa]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2475.658s">[Intoppa]</a>: Sorry about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2477.46s">[Intoppa]</a>: When you mentioned long-term substitute pay, you mentioned $275 a day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2483.326s">[Intoppa]</a>: Were you mentioning to this current budget or the proposed budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2530.399s">[Intoppa]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2530.78s">[Intoppa]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2531.2s">[Intoppa]</a>: Sorry, I just wanted to clarify because I wasn't sure if I heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2537.142s">[Intoppa]</a>: It's $100 because I will give a personal connection that my partner is a long-term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2551.343s">[Intoppa]</a>: Absolutely, because it's like $80 a day with tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2554.785s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I definitely could see the burden of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2557.527s">[Intoppa]</a>: But I wanted to clarify because I wasn't sure if I misheard you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rfgWV65I8WM&t=2559.869s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14854.083s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14855.344s">[Intoppa]</a>: John Ellen Toppa, 12 Murray Hill Road, Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14859.849s">[Intoppa]</a>: I just wanted to take a moment<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14861.691s">[Intoppa]</a>: and voice my opposition for the current bill as it stands.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14868.034s">[Intoppa]</a>: I feel like while I appreciate the amendment of having two to three minutes, I feel like that the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14876.75s">[Intoppa]</a>: especially have strong disregard for the 90 minute cap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14881.152s">[Intoppa]</a>: In terms of I understand where it comes from, I can sympathize with a lot of the issues that come with 1 a.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14887.815s">[Intoppa]</a>: meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14889.236s">[Intoppa]</a>: I also worry about the discomfort of someone who has waited those 90 minutes and their opportunities cut off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14895.039s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'm lucky that I have spoken up here a few times and can get my point across in three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14899.921s">[Intoppa]</a>: I know that for a lot of people who may wanna speak for the first time,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14903.963s">[Intoppa]</a>: a two-minute conversation can take five, and that's sort of where I'm at with that, but wanted to appreciate the studies that were brought in and appreciate what was going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14915.112s">[Intoppa]</a>: However, I feel like this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14917.523s">[Intoppa]</a>: proposed motion as it stands with the single amendment does not seem fit and I'd worry about the effect it may have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14924.485s">[Intoppa]</a>: The timing, of course, is a huge thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14926.225s">[Intoppa]</a>: That's why there's a lot of discomfort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14927.586s">[Intoppa]</a>: There's a lot of anger.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14929.926s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I wonder where that would be, if this would be proposed later, as well as other future sort of amendments that may differ at shorter agenda, caps on agenda time, things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14940.289s">[Intoppa]</a>: I don't know the legality of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14943.297s">[Intoppa]</a>: I didn't run for city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14944.157s">[Intoppa]</a>: I don't understand any of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14946.378s">[Intoppa]</a>: However, I appreciate you giving me the time to speak and would like to voice my opposition for the 90 minute cap and decrease from five to three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/X875ms8gt_4&t=14953.939s">[Intoppa]</a>: So, thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=285.823s">[Intoppa]</a>: It's really far away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=286.624s">[Intoppa]</a>: I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=411.365s">[Intoppa]</a>: Hi everyone, hopefully you can hear me all right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=413.808s">[Intoppa]</a>: I've been having some mic issues, but my name is john and tapa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=417.331s">[Intoppa]</a>: I am a also a recent grad of Medford high graduated in 2019 I also served as the class president of the class of 2019 so the senior class president.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=429.103s">[Intoppa]</a>: I just graduated also in May from the Massachusetts College of Art and Design and Industrial Design.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=434.346s">[Intoppa]</a>: which is all basically product design, toy design, medical design, you name it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=438.251s">[Intoppa]</a>: Also, informational flowcharts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=440.173s">[Intoppa]</a>: So, Darren Truong, really appreciate the graphic you have made for us that we will look at later in the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=446.861s">[Intoppa]</a>: But that's what I'm all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=448.935s">[Intoppa]</a>: My work, I work at MassArt now and I work in student engagement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=453.558s">[Intoppa]</a>: While I was a student at MassArt, I also served as the student trustee for a year and a half, and then the student body president for another two years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=462.004s">[Intoppa]</a>: So, for the last nearly decade my work has been in student advocacy and student success.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=469.534s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I'm really interested in working with y'all and treating y'all as a member of the table, because that's what I fought so hard for at MassArt, pulling the students out of the pandemic, because I was a freshman first year when the pandemic hit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=484.743s">[Intoppa]</a>: So really excited to work with y'all, because that's what my background is all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=490.366s">[Intoppa]</a>: So thank you for taking the time to be with us and join this really important committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=694.345s">[Intoppa]</a>: If I could chime in, because I remember if I'm correct, if the students can correct me, the current policy is there's a square chart in front of every door that says the bag can't be bigger than this, that you're allowed to carry around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=706.733s">[Intoppa]</a>: Is that still the policy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=707.754s">[Intoppa]</a>: Because that's how it was in 2019.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=715.234s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah, because I know the struggle like I when I was a seat when I was there, my floor was C2 and even C2 to be 3 was kind of crazy between classes with the 3 minute a lot of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=728.885s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I can't even imagine what the class below us, which I think was C1, I think 2020 class was C1 or C3.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=736.571s">[Intoppa]</a>: Because I know that's where the struggle was always talked about was with transporting stuff but now it's member or so as mentioned with most students having school issue devices like the Chromebooks, it's, it's an issue of carrying so many objects but also the fragility of if you drop that you're going to get charged if it breaks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=754.719s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I think it definitely would be worth having a discussion, especially with students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=760.117s">[Intoppa]</a>: especially making sure we have students who know that experience of getting from, again, dramatically from C1 to B3, seeing what that is like and where the struggles are and if we need to, how big we need to expand that policy or if we need to talk about just regular backpacks or if we, you know, I think the allocated size is only<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=785.327s">[Intoppa]</a>: It's like eight by 24.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=787.068s">[Intoppa]</a>: It's some weird like basic purse size, I think, if I remember correctly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=793.753s">[Intoppa]</a>: So it definitely would be worth, again, because of the new added responsibility of maintaining that piece of technology, it would be definitely worth relooking at in terms of making sure that that can be done safely and effectively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=814.073s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I would be interested, as a note, as a petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=818.999s">[Intoppa]</a>: Also, like with an added element of the petition to see student comments specifically about what their specific struggles are so we can self identify right off the bat, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=827.209s">[Intoppa]</a>: So when that petition goes out, I'd be I'd be curious to see what the specific needs are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=833.959s">[Intoppa]</a>: Because I don't want to try to solve a problem that no one has and waste so much energy on something that's like, no, we don't have this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=841.185s">[Intoppa]</a>: It'd be great to see what, like to hear from y'all what that is specifically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=846.589s">[Intoppa]</a>: Is it timing that's causing the issue?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=848.871s">[Intoppa]</a>: Is it amount of stuff you have to hold?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=852.214s">[Intoppa]</a>: It may be evident, but I would like to know specifically just so that way we can work efficiently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=859.676s">[Intoppa]</a>: to design a solution to this issue that you guys are facing to the point where a petition does have to go out and we do have to have this conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=1140.854s">[Intoppa]</a>: Could another, you know, we talked about informational hierarchy and informational services would another element of this of the interest of the students would be of, I hate to use the word life hacks but other suggested ways of cutting down time between classes of like past precedents of what other students have found effective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=1158.53s">[Intoppa]</a>: Like, I know that doesn't, it's not meant to be proposed as a cop-out of reforming the policy, but in addition to looking at the policy, would students find it helpful for there to be some kind of information on what other, you know, students, alumni have found effective to go between?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=1173.842s">[Intoppa]</a>: Like, I know for me, my cheat was that I always had my locker set to the first two, and then I could set it to the third and pull it and go, which isn't the safest option sometimes, and I learned it from a TV show on Nickelodeon when I was eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=1188.192s">[Intoppa]</a>: And that's the classified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=1189.512s">[Intoppa]</a>: But something like that where it's like where people find opportune times in their schedule, where people, because once I had a rhythm going, I knew what to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=1198.054s">[Intoppa]</a>: But that was bestowed upon me by another peer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=1202.134s">[Intoppa]</a>: So if they don't have that, so would an informational suggestion be of other usage to the students, essentially?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=1209.776s">[Intoppa]</a>: In addition to re-looking at the policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=1211.896s">[Intoppa]</a>: But I wouldn't want to exclude that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=1214.656s">[Intoppa]</a>: Informational sharing is a beautiful thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=1218.823s">[Intoppa]</a>: Just curious if that would be of interest as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=1296.256s">[Intoppa]</a>: No, that makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=1296.976s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you for sharing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2258.123s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah, I think that'd be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2260.085s">[Intoppa]</a>: Meeting with Mr. Guillaume, Mr. Green is also at a former position was also a proofreader so he'll be able to help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2267.952s">[Intoppa]</a>: If there's anything that he feels like should be added as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2271.996s">[Intoppa]</a>: I love how much thought has gone into this, especially I think I heard someone I think might have been knows like quantifiers in terms of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2281.366s">[Intoppa]</a>: missing homework, especially on snow days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2283.988s">[Intoppa]</a>: And then, you know, at what point do we go, okay, we kind of need to start instruction back up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2288.852s">[Intoppa]</a>: I think that's an incredible thought to be brought into it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2294.116s">[Intoppa]</a>: I did have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2295.237s">[Intoppa]</a>: There was a comment made about homework assigned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2301.502s">[Intoppa]</a>: Is our, backtracking for one second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2307.848s">[Intoppa]</a>: Was a point made, has this been happening where<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2311.323s">[Intoppa]</a>: faculty members will assign homework like way after hours to be completed for the following day is that what that was referring to where like homework will be assigned at like four or 5pm to then be completed during the school day is that like I don't want to get.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2328.194s">[Intoppa]</a>: you know, into something if that's not the case, but is that, was that, is that a reoccurring thing that's been happening?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2371.892s">[Intoppa]</a>: I gotcha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2372.373s">[Intoppa]</a>: So it's more of looking to, especially in those lecture hall, which are usually like the last worst case scenario situations of having the work be assigned so that way you're not sitting there playing with playing cards and just kind of doing other classwork.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2385.88s">[Intoppa]</a>: It's in that instruction period where your mind is set to work on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2391.147s">[Intoppa]</a>: American history to be working on a push homework essentially is what the thought is with that so it's more about that and less of like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2398.617s">[Intoppa]</a>: you're getting an email at 4pm that saying hey this is actually doing eight now okay just just checking to see what that was I wasn't sure what was going on, so I appreciate the information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2408.646s">[Intoppa]</a>: But overall, a lot of thought has been going into this, and I really appreciate the research that's done with the National Parents Union, within district and local wide, within quantifiers looking at, sometimes there may be certain situations where, thinking about the faculty member, if there is an extreme case in their end, they may just not be able to get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2429.684s">[Intoppa]</a>: So the understanding of working with people, I'm talking in circles right now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=2437.53s">[Intoppa]</a>: overall just really appreciate the work that's being done and looking forward to seeing what will be presented in the discussions we're having.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3124.434s">[Intoppa]</a>: So in terms of pick up, I don't recall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3129.945s">[Intoppa]</a>: So drop off to the school, I don't recall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3132.606s">[Intoppa]</a>: I drove or got driven in full transparency in terms of hiccup.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3139.369s">[Intoppa]</a>: The side where community schools is where that like stone courtyard is, that is what we're talking about in terms of like students funneling in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3147.472s">[Intoppa]</a>: It's always been a mess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3148.493s">[Intoppa]</a>: I remember students like standing on the hills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3151.834s">[Intoppa]</a>: They used to line up on the hills and try to balance themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3155.595s">[Intoppa]</a>: But also in terms of the buses, I am a victim of the North Medford Heights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3162.726s">[Intoppa]</a>: I live in the North Medford Heights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3164.347s">[Intoppa]</a>: I live right on the border of Malden.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3166.108s">[Intoppa]</a>: So if I had to take the bus home, I was on the yellow school bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3171.292s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I also know that and that picking up at a way different location was always weird to me of why that picks up by the Vogue automotive shop where the MBTA buses pick up at the community schools entrance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3184.491s">[Intoppa]</a>: So yeah, it's always been crowded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3186.153s">[Intoppa]</a>: It's always, I don't, I never viewed it as a safety issue at the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3191.457s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I don't, I haven't been up there during drop off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3194.26s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I don't know if it's getting worse in terms of like people just not knowing where to stand, how it looks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3198.824s">[Intoppa]</a>: It sounds like from the student representatives that it is getting a lot worse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3203.087s">[Intoppa]</a>: So if we can figure out ways to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3206.471s">[Intoppa]</a>: channel students to understand where to go or if the line gets too long where to wrap around and make sure you're still in the same line of the 95 versus the 101.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3216.355s">[Intoppa]</a>: But yeah, also wanted to give my thanks for this for the students who are working on this issue because it has always been an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3223.938s">[Intoppa]</a>: It was an issue when I was there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3225.319s">[Intoppa]</a>: It sounds like the safety part is a bigger issue that I had never heard of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3231.522s">[Intoppa]</a>: So thank you for bringing that up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3233.926s">[Intoppa]</a>: But yeah, the whole the North Medford bus is a whole nother issue with the MBTA not offering their services really up in our, our neck of the woods, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3710.814s">[Intoppa]</a>: No, I think this is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3712.035s">[Intoppa]</a>: Like I said, my, my education, my background is in user interface user experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3718.357s">[Intoppa]</a>: How do we tell people what the information is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3724.2s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I'm looking, I'm looking at it right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3725.76s">[Intoppa]</a>: That's why I'm on my phone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3728.401s">[Intoppa]</a>: I love the color coding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3729.782s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'm just going to like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3732.643s">[Intoppa]</a>: The fact that we're talking about state level changes how that because what this does is it does a great job of how you know how would you connect the mass legislature to an elementary school, like, how does that work that feedback gets there and this is a really good job of showing how this actually goes through the channels and the ways we need to get it done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3754.076s">[Intoppa]</a>: definitely support having this in terms of on the school committee website in terms of how student voices are heard, and how that process happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3764.863s">[Intoppa]</a>: Because it also helps empower the students to show that you know your voice does matter and sometimes that can be hard to convince students of how.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3771.727s">[Intoppa]</a>: you know, even at student government level, like, why does it matter?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3774.969s">[Intoppa]</a>: Why does it matter what I say?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3776.03s">[Intoppa]</a>: Nothing gets changed anyways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3777.031s">[Intoppa]</a>: Well, this is how it matters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3778.612s">[Intoppa]</a>: This is how it goes up the ranks and we work together and we get what we need to be done changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3785.216s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I really applaud you all for taking the time to actually take a lot of complex information and ideas and put it into a very visual, very visual chart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3797.604s">[Intoppa]</a>: So thank you for doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rB9j27alqxs&t=3936.52s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7180.711s">[Intoppa]</a>: For sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7181.091s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you, Director Schulman for presenting all this information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7184.053s">[Intoppa]</a>: I guess the first question is a clarification on the STEPS program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7190.836s">[Intoppa]</a>: It's very similar to the BRIDGE program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7192.317s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7192.457s">[Intoppa]</a>: It's like our chapter of like we've renamed it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7195.779s">[Intoppa]</a>: Exactly right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7198.22s">[Intoppa]</a>: that's huge, and that's proven in other districts to really help a lot of our youth, especially, well, not our youth, but it is, seems to be helping our youth, but youth in other districts, especially as the mental health crisis and epidemic, as people were calling it, is increasing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7217.708s">[Intoppa]</a>: And we saw that in an increase in numbers, and then, you know, we're slowly seeing them come down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7224.631s">[Intoppa]</a>: In terms of tier one, tier two,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7227.972s">[Intoppa]</a>: two and tier three in terms of, I noticed that, was it suicide screening and prevention was on all tiers and different approaches with that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7237.839s">[Intoppa]</a>: How are we approaching it at a tier one versus a tier three?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7244.883s">[Intoppa]</a>: Awesome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7245.864s">[Intoppa]</a>: And then love to see that a lot of things were starting in middle school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7249.866s">[Intoppa]</a>: I was curious to hear about some of the things that were starting in elementary school in terms of,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7255.797s">[Intoppa]</a>: sort of education with this, because obviously you don't want to like put all these topics on elementary schoolers, but I know I was a student who suffered with severe anxiety and was put into therapy as a third grader.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7268.464s">[Intoppa]</a>: And a lot of that was the unknown of what I was feeling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7271.926s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I'm curious to see, there's two parts to this, curious to see where we're going in terms of possibly seeing in some soft integration of possible mental health education within our elementary schools,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7285.734s">[Intoppa]</a>: because that can be one of the scariest parts of when you're eight, you don't know what's happening, why you feel a certain way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7292.419s">[Intoppa]</a>: I know that was certainly the case for me, as well as looking at, and we talked about it, I believe you talked about a little bit in the program about the self-reliance skills, not self-reliance, but it was social and emotional learning outside of the classroom and looking at other programs, sort of, I know that some universities are adapting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7311.909s">[Intoppa]</a>: Things like headspace subscriptions for students, you know, obviously institutionally wide but maybe for us case by case basis ways for students to learn how to I hate to use the word deal with these things but off hours of how students are able to get support and resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7330.134s">[Intoppa]</a>: Because a lot of these issues are still stigmatized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7333.639s">[Intoppa]</a>: There's still an issue of why are you stressed, you're 13, what's going on, what's stressing you out so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7339.106s">[Intoppa]</a>: But for a lot of these students, it really is a huge, huge problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7345.013s">[Intoppa]</a>: So curious to see the direction possibly we're looking at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7348.965s">[Intoppa]</a>: of out-of-class help, support and resources, you know, even just like a brochure of phone lines to call if you're feeling this way in the middle of the night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7356.211s">[Intoppa]</a>: Who do you get into contact with?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7358.673s">[Intoppa]</a>: Because I don't, again, I've only been out of the public schools for five years now, but I don't ever remember seeing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7365.198s">[Intoppa]</a>: Maybe it's because I didn't need the resources at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7368.04s">[Intoppa]</a>: But that also says I feel like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7371.621s">[Intoppa]</a>: Or I am under the impression of, I feel like this information should be present without needing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7377.684s">[Intoppa]</a>: Like we should have these ready.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7379.705s">[Intoppa]</a>: It should be nowhere to go before we even need to, you know, think about the bridge program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7384.067s">[Intoppa]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7384.467s">[Intoppa]</a>: So that's a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7386.768s">[Intoppa]</a>: But I guess the two, the too long didn't read of all that is looking at possible integration with, you know, the elementary school, seeing where we're at in terms of screening there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7396.974s">[Intoppa]</a>: because that's also where I was screened for ADD, and that really helped set me up for my further education, as well as the, as it's put in the report, social-emotional learning integration throughout.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7410.657s">[Intoppa]</a>: So where we're at with that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7484.335s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah, and I guess the more part of like, I know this would probably be more for high school or would integrate starting in the high school, but again, that looking at other programs outside of the classroom for students to access, whether it's a portal online or even like, again, like a brochure of resources outside of the Medford Public Schools that they may utilize, looking at integration of that as well within this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7535.99s">[Intoppa]</a>: Awesome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7536.37s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=7537.051s">[Intoppa]</a>: Really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8777.57s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes, thank you, Director Zahara for coming and giving all these numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8782.013s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'd be interested to see at some point sort of our statistics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8787.057s">[Intoppa]</a>: I know this probably pertains more to our high school students who come in as English language learners with their sort of integration into the arts and athletic departments and how they are sort of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8799.94s">[Intoppa]</a>: coexisting in those spaces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8801.86s">[Intoppa]</a>: I know that at least my time at the high school, it always seemed very sectioned off in terms of not just academics, but also in terms of culture, like the culture of just leisure and existing in these spaces together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8819.944s">[Intoppa]</a>: And that's really unfortunate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8823.065s">[Intoppa]</a>: Even at, we had a lot of EL students participate as stage crew,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8828.736s">[Intoppa]</a>: And the drama club and they always stuck together and we're off by themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8833.921s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I'd love to find out if there's a way that we can minimize that culture of things I mean it's a very scary thing of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8842.881s">[Intoppa]</a>: you know, learning linguistics and settling in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8845.363s">[Intoppa]</a>: And for some of these individual students, there was an individual who was on the crew team with member Olapade and I, who had just landed in the US in Somerville their first year, and we met them their second year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8860.111s">[Intoppa]</a>: And they didn't know the word for screwdriver.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8862.553s">[Intoppa]</a>: And then by the end of it, you know, they were,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8867.014s">[Intoppa]</a>: The growth that we witnessed with that individual because of how integrated they were and how socialized they were with us and how the program really benefited them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8876.644s">[Intoppa]</a>: It was a really beautiful thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8877.665s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I'd love to see sort of what we're doing as a As a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8886.758s">[Intoppa]</a>: division, I don't know the right word, at the moment to push students to sort of more coexist together because it's benefit for both sides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8895.66s">[Intoppa]</a>: It's benefit for all involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8897.84s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I'd love to see that at some point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8920.928s">[Intoppa]</a>: Love to see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=8921.549s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9691.252s">[Intoppa]</a>: Sorry, my apologies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9692.312s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you, Madam Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9694.353s">[Intoppa]</a>: I share a similar concern with Premier Reinfeld about section two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9698.874s">[Intoppa]</a>: Each new member will present to the committee secretary official certification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9702.175s">[Intoppa]</a>: I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9703.604s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'm not sure where else it's done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9706.947s">[Intoppa]</a>: But to me, I feel like this as someone who just went through the process of policy not existing and policy being vacant and a week of anxiety around what happens next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9721.438s">[Intoppa]</a>: This, I, it almost, it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9726.519s">[Intoppa]</a>: I don't want to say it feels unnecessary, because I appreciate the work that's been done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9729.802s">[Intoppa]</a>: But I don't see what the committee secretary has to do with the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9734.407s">[Intoppa]</a>: And again, that could just be my naiveness of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9736.87s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'm two weeks into this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9740.173s">[Intoppa]</a>: But to me, I feel like striking almost this from the policy, I don't see it's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9750.592s">[Intoppa]</a>: Like you said, less is more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9751.853s">[Intoppa]</a>: And to me, again, if we have a total rehaul of our school committee, which could happen, what does this do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9757.738s">[Intoppa]</a>: And what happens then?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9760.42s">[Intoppa]</a>: But I would almost move to have, like the rest of the policy, very understandable, makes sense, especially the Massachusetts Ethics Commission summary of the common interest law, making sure we're up to date on that information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9772.29s">[Intoppa]</a>: However, section two, to me, feels almost like it could be striking out of this policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=9919.319s">[Intoppa]</a>: I was going to say, because I believe that is the protocol we had to follow, was we had to present the certification of election, or in my case, appointment to the city clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10619.699s">[Intoppa]</a>: I was just gonna say, does a motion to amend need to be put on the floor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10623.382s">[Intoppa]</a>: Because I can do that right now, is what I'm asking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10666.678s">[Intoppa]</a>: have the channel links, but to have the community media link, the YouTube link, as well as the channel numbers, because again, it helps if you're trying to watch that on the TV.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10681.284s">[Intoppa]</a>: Channel numbers and YouTube, correct, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10683.625s">[Intoppa]</a>: So that would be my motion to amend, would be to strike that and include channel numbers and YouTube link.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10814.652s">[Intoppa]</a>: Then, yeah, with that, that information makes complete sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10817.775s">[Intoppa]</a>: Then I would move to make a motion to amend and just have the YouTube link on the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10823.576s">[Intoppa]</a>: agenda circling back thousands of times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10825.899s">[Intoppa]</a>: But if the if we can't rely on the channels being consistent, even if they're next to each other, we do open ourselves up to that liability of, again, false advertising, where the it's being broadcasted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=10837.631s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I was thinking from a standpoint of people who may not have smart TVs, maybe using, you know, the educational platform, but then again, we don't want to run into that issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11752.087s">[Intoppa]</a>: If I can, I'd like to waive my time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11753.348s">[Intoppa]</a>: I believe a member of the public would like to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11755.771s">[Intoppa]</a>: So if I can waive out of order and then circle back, because I don't know if I have some questions about impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11762.696s">[Intoppa]</a>: So if the member of the public has any answers about that, I can reassess my questions, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11770.703s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I waive my time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11955.386s">[Intoppa]</a>: Well, first off, I just want to thank you for coming forward and sharing your story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11959.949s">[Intoppa]</a>: That's not easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11961.13s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I apologize that that happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11965.179s">[Intoppa]</a>: My question surrounded the effectiveness of what we're proposing, but it almost sounds like we need to take a reassessment of what we look at in terms of the disciplinary practice of suspension looking at the cases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11982.478s">[Intoppa]</a>: and also just to do the work looking at the claim of who's being affected higher in terms of suspension rates, as you had mentioned with IEP students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/a6yjvy9bets&t=11996.128s">[Intoppa]</a>: So my questions have greatly shifted, but I'm wondering where we have to look at, reassess the language and to see what fits in best practice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=44.356s">[Intoppa]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=47.277s">[Intoppa]</a>: That's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=48.018s">[Intoppa]</a>: I don't know what's going on, but I'll just go for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=50.499s">[Intoppa]</a>: It's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=4118.359s">[Intoppa]</a>: No, I was just gonna, to member, thank you, to member Rousseau's point of the Cummings Foundation, that large grant funds the CCSR over an expanded amount of time, so that might be why, and I don't know if they have to give it back, but I do know they have to apply, I think,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=4136.903s">[Intoppa]</a>: every 10 years or so, it's like somewhere between six to 10.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=4142.005s">[Intoppa]</a>: But I was curious about the gift fund and if that had any in time in with the alumni association and where those funds are handled, where the overflow of SGA funds from the previous classes, I know some of them, sometimes they're retained, sometimes the SGA funds<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=4163.977s">[Intoppa]</a>: go into like the alumni association so that way they can do their own private scholarship.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=4167.858s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I'm curious to see how much of that may be attributing to that, if at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=4173.919s">[Intoppa]</a>: Or if it's purely outside, if it's purely outside donations of people who wanna give back to our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=4189.943s">[Intoppa]</a>: I know, my apologies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=4191.673s">[Intoppa]</a>: figure out my mic, but I would be interested to see where the MHS gift fund, what is funding that, if it's anything with the alumni association, if it's in terms of like overflow of SGA funds, the student government funds with fundraised funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=4208.978s">[Intoppa]</a>: And then the beginning point, again, I don't know how much was heard, fixing my mic situation for next meeting about the Cummings Foundation being a grant that's spent over a few years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=4218.581s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I think we're actually,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=4220.749s">[Intoppa]</a>: in year one or year two of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=4222.59s">[Intoppa]</a>: I think it was just replenished, which might be why that number is so large, but that is the predominant funding source for all of the units of CCSR and all the projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/di3OGRzz05w&t=4778.882s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2206.977s">[Intoppa]</a>: Hello, it's good to see you all again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2209.758s">[Intoppa]</a>: My name is John Intoppa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2211.018s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'm the senior class president of the class of 2019 and a member of the CCSR.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2215.339s">[Intoppa]</a>: I run Project Little Library, which is goal is to bring the love of literature and more reading towards the Heights and North Medford area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2224.665s">[Intoppa]</a>: Through the CCSR, I have been able to fine tune and work on my social responsibility and leadership skills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2230.969s">[Intoppa]</a>: And by doing so, I can proudly say that Project Little Library is 100% locally business funded from businesses such as Modern Hardware, Fabrizio Wood Products, and the Vogue graphics department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2242.917s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I couldn't have done it without help from the mayor's office and the Bill Cummings and Crystal Campbell Fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2261.85s">[Intoppa]</a>: So there's one right now and I'm working on many more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2264.251s">[Intoppa]</a>: The one that I'm working on will be on display at the project fair on April 25th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2268.914s">[Intoppa]</a>: The one that we're doing right now will be on Murray Hill Road in the North Medford.<br><br>
