    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2959.409s">[Intoppa]</a>: Member Intapa?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2960.93s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2961.571s">[Intoppa]</a>: This probably isn't an important question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2963.953s">[Intoppa]</a>: This is just me being curious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2965.254s">[Intoppa]</a>: What CAD program are they teaching the kids?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2967.436s">[Intoppa]</a>: Are they teaching them SolidWorks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2969.178s">[Intoppa]</a>: I have no idea what the name of the program is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2970.759s">[Intoppa]</a>: Because it looks like the program that I was taught in college.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2973.862s">[Intoppa]</a>: So the fact that we're teaching these students such a, I mean, like it might not be, but it looks just like that program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2981.889s">[Intoppa]</a>: I use it at a college level and at an industry level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2984.471s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I just want to...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3004.395s">[Intoppa]</a>: I wish I had that when I was, like, that's crazy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3009.278s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3009.678s">[Intoppa]</a>: That's the only time you can get, but it's... I wanted to take that, I'm sorry, my mic is echoing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3015.703s">[Intoppa]</a>: everywhere um i'll speak softer um i just want to echo how great that is um because again like this is these are this is the time to learn these programs and you know it'll excel the future um through that so that i just wanted to send my regards is awesome thank you great thank you very much<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10442.964s">[Intoppa]</a>: Point of clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10444.264s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10444.664s">[Intoppa]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10445.085s">[Intoppa]</a>: Point of clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10446.165s">[Intoppa]</a>: My sincerest condolences to the family of Robin Irving, who was a McGlynn Middle School educator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10455.489s">[Intoppa]</a>: Just wanted to point that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10456.93s">[Intoppa]</a>: I also just wanted to say real quickly, because I know some of his family might be on the call and as a representative of the class of 2019, just really echo my sincere condolences to the family of Wade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10470.444s">[Intoppa]</a>: I've been trying to figure out how to really feel about this whole situation as we've all seen it play out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10478.857s">[Intoppa]</a>: But I wanted to just tell a quick story because I feel like it's an important message.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10482.563s">[Intoppa]</a>: I know it's late, but I'll make it quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10485.808s">[Intoppa]</a>: When the class lost a Pervative Coda in 2019, we were all extremely grief-stricken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10493.676s">[Intoppa]</a>: And about two years later, Wade actually reached out to me because he had known me working on scholarship.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10500.602s">[Intoppa]</a>: And he was like, hey, man, I'm sorry to bother you on your personal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10503.685s">[Intoppa]</a>: I was like, it's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10504.446s">[Intoppa]</a>: You can always reach out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10506.248s">[Intoppa]</a>: And he was like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10508.024s">[Intoppa]</a>: I'm really, you know, I was really close with him and I really wanted to do something for him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10512.932s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I don't know what to do, but I really want to do this thing that as a man of faith, he wanted to do a proxy baptism.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10521.537s">[Intoppa]</a>: And he had said, you know, but I really want to make sure I do this right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10525.22s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I really want to make sure that I go through the proper channels and I talk with the family because, you know, I could go to their door if I wanted to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10532.225s">[Intoppa]</a>: But, you know, I don't I don't want to do this right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10536.468s">[Intoppa]</a>: And so we talked with the family and we we got their approval and he went through with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10543.232s">[Intoppa]</a>: He was able to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10545.594s">[Intoppa]</a>: But, you know, something that Wade really stood for, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10549.474s">[Intoppa]</a>: making sure we care for and consider for and love one another even when no one is looking because he didn't have to do that but he did and he made sure that he was at peace and the family was at peace through no incidentals and i really just employ everyone listening that as we sort of navigate this grief to use the power of community and to check in on one another<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10575.925s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I implore you all to text or reach out to in any way that you can, however you feel like you can, to someone you haven't talked to in a while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10586.209s">[Intoppa]</a>: And to just really, really build that sense of community through what we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10591.45s">[Intoppa]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7177.78s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7231.067s">[Intoppa]</a>: Hello?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7236.371s">[Intoppa]</a>: Is this still feedbacking?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=7237.652s">[Intoppa]</a>: No, we're good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10533.596s">[Intoppa]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11190.121s">[Intoppa]</a>: I sort of piggyback, thank you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11192.562s">[Intoppa]</a>: I also piggyback the comments of my peers surrounding the MCAS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11196.543s">[Intoppa]</a>: I used to be joked about that I was gonna run for school committee when I was at the Missatuck because I was so against the MCAS and it's actually my grandfather who was a long time educator in Wilmington retired early because of this becoming a requirement for graduation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11213.808s">[Intoppa]</a>: I've also heard horror stories of students who were capable and were great students, but you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11219.844s">[Intoppa]</a>: due to whatever, you know, it's an equity issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11221.886s">[Intoppa]</a>: It's a quality issue of accessibility and they could not, almost did not graduate because of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11229.391s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I am very much in support of that first question, 100% of, not to, I mean, I was able to afford higher education because of the MCAS because I was able to get a scholarship because of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11240.4s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I'm very fortunate and privileged that that was a thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11244.443s">[Intoppa]</a>: So yes, the unfortunate misconception that we're just getting rid of it and like, what happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11248.966s">[Intoppa]</a>: if we get rid of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11250.307s">[Intoppa]</a>: We're just getting rid of it as a requirement to move on to higher education or wherever you may want to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11257.43s">[Intoppa]</a>: So for question two, I'm a huge, huge supporter of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11260.651s">[Intoppa]</a>: So yeah, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2274.713s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2279.977s">[Intoppa]</a>: And thank you, Mayor, for also the clarification on the possible, the fact that we just still don't know what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2288.745s">[Intoppa]</a>: And I find that deeply unsettling, and we gotta figure that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2292.548s">[Intoppa]</a>: My questions with the data presented, do we know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2297.572s">[Intoppa]</a>: It's listed here, the Medford High Complex is listed as one item line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2301.296s">[Intoppa]</a>: Do we know the breakdown of faucets or fixtures, I guess is the better phrase, that are impacted in the high school versus the vocational buildings?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2313.19s">[Intoppa]</a>: Do we know the proportional difference between the two if one was more impacted than the other?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2325.252s">[Intoppa]</a>: Okay, no, that was just one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2336.525s">[Intoppa]</a>: OK, cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2337.326s">[Intoppa]</a>: No, I just wanted a clarification on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2338.866s">[Intoppa]</a>: And then also curious as to why, looking at the numbers again, why the two middle schools with the Andrews being impacted the most with above 15 parts per billion with 52 fixtures affected and the McGlynn Middle School with 33.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2358.411s">[Intoppa]</a>: I guess that has to go with the investigation when it comes to why it's happening and what it's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2363.913s">[Intoppa]</a>: But that is a stark number and difference compared to the rest of our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2371.937s">[Intoppa]</a>: So I'm not sure what that says for the data, but I just want to make a comment about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2375.998s">[Intoppa]</a>: And then in terms of turnaround with data, do we know what the appropriate time is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2380.28s">[Intoppa]</a>: Because the last number I saw was June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2383.117s">[Intoppa]</a>: Do we know when the turnaround is for when we should be getting this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2386.642s">[Intoppa]</a>: Like when we do testing, how long does it take to usually get results back?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2401.784s">[Intoppa]</a>: Sounds good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2403.706s">[Intoppa]</a>: I think that's all I have, but just wanted to thank MassDV for doing this great work and for helping us figure this all out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2412.072s">[Intoppa]</a>: Yeah, that's all I have to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2413.233s">[Intoppa]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>
